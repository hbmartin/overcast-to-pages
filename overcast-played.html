<ul>
<li>Will McGugan</li>
<li>“Python properties work well with type checkers such Mypy and friends. … The type of your property is taken from the getter only. Even if your setter accepts different types, the type checker will complain on assignment.”</li>
<li>Will describes a way to get around this and make type checkers happy.</li>
<li>He replaces <code>@property</code> with a descriptor. It’s a cool technique.</li>
<li>I also like the way Will is allowing different ways to use a property such that it’s more convenient for the user. This is a cool deverloper usability trick.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brian #3: <a href="https://github.com/rohaquinlop/complexipy?featured_on=pythonbytes">complexipy</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Calculates the cognitive complexity of Python files, written in Rust.</li>
<li>Based on the cognitive complexity measurement described in a white paper by Sonar</li>
<li>Cognitive complexity builds on the idea of cyclomatic complexity.</li>
<li>Cyclomatic complexity was intended to measure the “testability and maintainability” of the control flow of a module. Sonar argues that it’s fine for testability, but doesn’t do well with measuring the “maintainability” part. So they came up with a new measure.</li>
<li>Cognitive complexity is intended to reflects the relative difficulty of understanding, and therefore of maintaining methods, classes, and applications.</li>
<li>complexipy essentially does that, but also has a really nice color output.</li>
<li>Note: at the very least, you should be using “cyclomatic complexity”
<ul>
<li>try with <code>ruff check --select C901</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But also try complexipy.</li>
<li>Great for understanding which functions might be ripe for refactoring, adding more documentation, surrounding with more tests, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>uv kernel for Jupyter</li>
<li>⚙️ <strong>Automatic Environment Setup:</strong> When the notebook is opened, Juvio installs the dependencies automatically in an ephemeral virtual environment (using <code>uv</code>), ensuring that the notebook runs with the correct versions of the packages and Python</li>
<li>📁 <strong>Git-Friendly Format:</strong> Notebooks are converted on the fly to a script-style format using <code># %%</code> markers, making diffs and version control painless</li>
<li>Why Use Juvio?

<li>No additional lock or requirements files are needed</li>
<li>Guaranteed reproducibility</li>
<li>Cleaner Git diffs</li>

            <p>On this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Brian Morrison, Senior Developer Educator at Clerk. They cover the state of authentication today, what makes Clerk stand out for small teams and indie builders, and how thoughtful developer experience design can make or break adoption.Brian shares why bundling tools like auth, billing, and user management is becoming more common, how Clerk handles real-world concerns like bot protection and social login, and why starting with a great developer experience matters more than ever.The conversation also explores the role of AI in software development and content creation, where it helps, where it hurts, and how to use it responsibly without losing quality or trust.Keypoints for this Episode:</p><ul><li>Modern auth is about experience, not just security. Clerk simplifies user management, social login, bot protection, and subscription billing with developer-friendly APIs and polished default UIs.</li></ul><ul><li>Bundled platforms are making a comeback. Developers are shifting from handpicking tools to using tightly integrated services that reduce setup time and complexity.</li></ul><ul><li>Developer education needs more care and creativity. Brian emphasizes the importance of visual storytelling, thoughtful structure, and anticipating confusion to help devs learn faster and retain more.</li></ul><ul><li>AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement. The group discusses how AI can accelerate development and content creation when used with oversight, but warn against using it to blindly build entire apps.</li></ul><p>Follow Brian Morrison on Social MediaTwitter: <a href="https://x.com/brianmmdev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">https://x.com/brianmmdev</a>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmmdev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmmdev/</a>Sponsored by This Dot: <a href="thisdotlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">thisdotlabs.com</a></p>

However these extra-large language models are very difficult to serve.</p><p><strong>Baseten</strong> was the first of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latent.space/p/gpu-bubble">Inference neocloud startups</a> to get DeepSeek V3 online, because of their H200 clusters, their close collaboration with the DeepSeek team and early support of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang">SGLang</a>, a relatively new VLLM alternative that is also used at frontier labs like X.ai. Each H200 has 141 GB of VRAM with 4.8 TB per second of bandwidth, meaning that you can use 8 H200's in a node to inference DeepSeek v3 in FP8, taking into account KV Cache needs. </p><p>We have been close to Baseten since Sarah Guo introduced Amir Haghighat to swyx, and they supported the very first <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latent.space/p/jan-2023-update?open=false#%C2%A7generative-ai-hackathon-sf-feb">Latent Space Demo Day</a> in San Francisco, which was effectively the trial run for swyx and Alessio to work together! </p><p>Since then, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/philip_kiely/status/1872408515182207394"><strong>Philip Kiely</strong></a> also led a well attended workshop on TensorRT LLM at the 2024 World's Fair. </p><p>We worked with him to get two of their best representatives, Amir and Lead Model Performance Engineer <strong>Yineng Zhang</strong>, to discuss DeepSeek, SGLang, and everything they have learned running Mission Critical Inference workloads at scale for some of the largest AI products in the world.</p><p>The Three Pillars of Mission Critical Inference</p><p>We initially planned to focus the conversation on SGLang, but Amir and Yineng were quick to correct us that the choice of inference framework is only the simplest, first choice of 3 things you need for production inference at scale:</p><p>“I think it takes three things, and each of them individually is necessary but not sufficient: </p><p>* <strong>Performance at the model level</strong>: how fast are you running this one model running on a single GPU, let's say. The framework that you use there can, can matter. The techniques that you use there can matter. The MLA technique, for example, that Yineng mentioned, or the CUDA kernels that are being used. But there's also techniques being used at a higher level, things like speculative decoding with draft models or with Medusa heads. And these are implemented in the different frameworks, or you can even implement it yourself, but they're not necessarily tied to a single framework. But using speculative decoding gets you massive upside when it comes to being able to handle high throughput. <strong>But that's not enough. Invariably, that one model running on a single GPU, let's say, is going to get too much traffic that it cannot handle.</strong></p><p>* <strong>Horizontal scaling at the cluster/region level: </strong>And at that point, you need to horizontally scale it. That's not an ML problem. That's not a PyTorch problem. That's an infrastructure problem. How quickly do you go from, <strong>a single replica of that model to 5, to 10, to 100</strong>. And so that's the second, that's the second pillar that is necessary for running these machine critical inference workloads.</p><p>And what does it take to do that? It takes, some people are like, Oh, You just need Kubernetes and Kubernetes has an autoscaler and that just works. That doesn't work for, for these kinds of mission critical inference workloads. And <strong>you end up catching yourself wanting to bit by bit to rebuild those infrastructure pieces from scratch</strong>. This has been our experience. </p><p>* And then going even a layer beyond that, Kubernetes runs in a single. cluster. It's a single cluster. It's a single region tied to a single region. And when it comes to inference workloads and needing GPUs more and more, you know, we're seeing this that you cannot meet the demand inside of a single region. A single cloud's a single region. In other words, a single model might want to horizontally scale up to 200 replicas, each of which is, let's say, 2H100s or 4H100s or even a full node, you run into limits of the capacity inside of that one region. And what we had to build to get around that was <strong>the ability to have a single model have replicas across different regions</strong>. So, you know, there are models on Baseten today that have 50 replicas in GCP East and, 80 replicas in AWS West and Oracle in London, etc.</p><p>* <strong>Developer experience for Compound AI Systems: </strong>The final one is wrapping the power of the first two pillars in a very good developer experience to be able to afford certain workflows like the ones that I mentioned, around <a target="_blank" href="https://www.baseten.co/blog/baseten-chains-explained/">multi step, multi model inference workloads</a>, because more and more we're seeing that the market is moving towards those that the needs are generally in these sort of more complex workflows. </p><p>We think they said it very well.</p><p></p><p>Show Notes</p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirhaghighat/">Amir Haghighat</a>, Co-Founder, Baseten</p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhyncs/">Yineng Zhang</a>, Lead Software Engineer, Model Performance, Baseten</p><p></p><p>Full YouTube Episode</p><p>Please <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KjH7Gl0_pq0">like and subscribe</a>!</p><p>Timestamps</p><p>* <strong>00:00</strong> Introduction and Latest AI Model Launch</p><p>* <strong>00:11</strong> DeepSeek v3: Specifications and Achievements</p><p>* <strong>03:10</strong> Latent Space Podcast: Special Guests Introduction</p><p>* <strong>04:12</strong> DeepSeek v3: Technical Insights</p><p>* <strong>11:14</strong> Quantization and Model Performance</p><p>* <strong>16:19</strong> MOE Models: Trends and Challenges</p><p>* <strong>18:53</strong> Baseten's Inference Service and Pricing</p><p>* <strong>31:13</strong> Optimization for DeepSeek</p><p>* <strong>31:45</strong> Three Pillars of Mission Critical Inference Workloads</p><p>* <strong>32:39</strong> Scaling Beyond Single GPU</p><p>* <strong>33:09</strong> Challenges with Kubernetes and Infrastructure</p><p>* <strong>33:40</strong> Multi-Region Scaling Solutions</p><p>* <strong>35:34</strong> SG Lang: A New Framework</p><p>* <strong>38:52</strong> Key Techniques Behind SG Lang</p><p>* <strong>48:27</strong> Speculative Decoding and Performance</p><p>* <strong>49:54</strong> Future of Fine-Tuning and RLHF</p><p>* <strong>01:00:28</strong> Baseten's V3 and Industry Trends</p><p></p><p>Baseten’s previous TensorRT LLM workshop:</p> <br></br><br></br>Get full access to Latent.Space at <a href="https://www.latent.space/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.latent.space/subscribe</a>

            Hugo speaks with Alex Strick van Linschoten, Machine Learning Engineer at ZenML and creator of a comprehensive LLMOps database documenting over 400 deployments. Alex's extensive research into real-world LLM implementations gives him unique insight into what actually works—and what doesn't—when deploying AI agents in production.
In this episode, we dive into:
- The current state of AI agents in production, from successes to common failure modes
- Practical lessons learned from analyzing hundreds of real-world LLM deployments
- How companies like Anthropic, Klarna, and Dropbox are using patterns like ReAct, RAG, and microservices to build reliable systems
- The evolution of LLM capabilities, from expanding context windows to multimodal applications
- Why most companies still prefer structured workflows over fully autonomous agents
We also explore real-world case studies of production hurdles, including cascading failures, API misfires, and hallucination challenges. Alex shares concrete strategies for integrating LLMs into your pipelines while maintaining reliability and control.
Whether you're scaling agents or building LLM-powered systems, this episode offers practical insights for navigating the complex landscape of LLMOps in 2025.

        <p>Building software is difficult and rarely can software engineers do it alone. In this episode, Kris is joined by Ian, Matthew, and Angelica to talk managing software projects and what three often used but rarely defined roles actually mean: project manager, product manager, and program manager. The panel also discusses how these roles interact with engineering managers, what they think these roles actually do, and whether product managers should actually exist.</p><p>For our supporters, this episode contains an extended discussion including a discussion on whether you should trust a new company you join, how to build trust, and what metrics we should measure for project success.

            In this podcast, Michael Stiefel spoke with Rashmi Venugopal about two topics. The first is how the middle-tier creates the application from the raw materials in the back-end,  and how the front-end uses the middle-tier to present a meaningful workflow to the user.  The second is how to manage the usually inevitable software migration that results from a successful software product.

        <div class="description">
            <p>The line between generic AI capabilities and truly transformative business applications often comes down to one thing: your data. While foundation models provide impressive general intelligence, they lack the specialized knowledge needed for domain-specific tasks that drive real business value. But how do you effectively bridge this gap? What's the difference between simply fine-tuning models versus using techniques like retrieval-augmented generation? And with constantly evolving models and technologies, how do you build systems that remain adaptable while still delivering consistent results? Whether you're in retail, healthcare, or transportation, understanding how to properly enrich, annotate, and leverage your proprietary data could be the difference between an AI project that fails and one that fundamentally transforms your business.</p><p>Wendy Gonzalez is the CEO — and former COO — of Sama, a company leading the way in ethical AI by delivering accurate, human-annotated data while advancing economic opportunity in underserved communities. She joined Sama in 2015 and has been central to scaling both its global operations and its mission-driven business model, which has helped over 65,000 people lift themselves out of poverty through dignified digital work. With over 20 years of experience in the tech and data space, Wendy’s held leadership roles at EY, Capgemini, and Cycle30, where she built and managed high-performing teams across complex, global environments. Her leadership style blends operational excellence with deep purpose — ensuring that innovation doesn’t come at the expense of integrity. Wendy is also a vocal advocate for inclusive AI and sustainable impact, regularly speaking on how companies can balance cutting-edge technology with real-world responsibility.</p><p>Duncan Curtis is the Senior Vice President of Generative AI at Sama, where he leads the development of AI-powered tools that are shaping the future of data annotation. With a background in product leadership and machine learning, Duncan has spent his career building scalable systems that bridge cutting-edge technology with real-world impact. Before joining Sama, he led teams at companies like Google, where he worked on large-scale personalization systems, and contributed to AI product strategy across multiple sectors. At Sama, he's focused on harnessing the power of generative AI to improve quality, speed, and efficiency — all while keeping human oversight and ethical practices at the core. Duncan brings a unique perspective to the AI space: one that’s grounded in technical expertise, but always oriented toward practical solutions and responsible innovation.</p><p>In the episode, Richie, Wendy, and Duncan explore the importance of using specialized data with large language models, the role of data enrichment in improving AI accuracy, the balance between automation and human oversight, the significance of responsible AI practices, and much more.</p><p><strong>Links Mentioned in the Show:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.sama.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sama</a></li><li>Connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendy-gonzalez-a319788" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wendy</a></li><li>Connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-curtis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Duncan</a></li><li><a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/generative-ai-concepts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Course: Generative AI Concepts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/podcast/creating-high-quality-ai-applications" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Related Episode: Creating High Quality AI Applications with Theresa Parker & Sudhi Balan, Rocket Software</a></li><li><a href="https://www.datacamp-staging.com/radar/ai-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Register for RADAR AI</a></li></ul><br></br><p><strong>New to DataCamp?</strong></p><ul><li>Learn on the go...</li></ul>

            <p>In this episode, we spoke to Kirsten Hill.</p><p>Dr Kirsten Hill is a researcher, writer, and the founder of bisque — a survey platform that actually cares if you get good data. She has a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, has led research for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and has worked with over 100 mission-driven teams on measurement & evaluation. This past year, she authored her first book, Ask Better Questions, a top release on survey design — and realized that writing the book wasn’t enough. If she really wanted to change how people do research, she had to build the tools that would make it easier to do it right. With real-time AI feedback, intuitive design, and built-in best practices, bisque makes it easy to create surveys that get you the answers you actually need.</p><p>We spoke to Kirsten about how and why surveys are often bad, why she believes the major survey platforms aren't fit for purpose, why she's building her own survey platform "bisque", how she's using Large Language Models to develop a working prototype, and what advice she has for other non-programmers who want to build things with AI.</p><p>You can find her on:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstenleehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenleehill</a></li><li>TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirstenleehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenleehill</a></li><li>Substack <a href="https://kirstenleehill.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kirstenleehill.substack.com</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p>---</p><p>David’s book, The Well-Grounded Data Analyst is out! <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst">⁠https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst⁠</a></p><p>If you want to find out more, we have a whole episode about it: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5D0iDtQRh3tWiIhokrjz3x?si=AiX6YyRET16lnzXDlvdcfw">⁠https://open.spotify.com/episode/5D0iDtQRh3tWiIhokrjz3x?si=AiX6YyRET16lnzXDlvdcfw</a></p>

            <p>In this episode of AI + a16z, Anthropic's David Soria Parra — who created MCP (Model Context Protocol) along with Justin Spahr-Summers — sits down with a16z's Yoko Li to discuss the project's inception, exciting use cases for connecting LLMs to external sources, and what's coming next for the project. If you're unfamiliar with the wildly popular MCP project, this edited passage from their discussion is a great starting point to learn:</p><p><strong>David: </strong>"MCP tries to enable building AI applications in such a way that they can be extended by everyone else that is not part of the original development team through these MCP servers, and really bring the workflows you care about, the things you want to do, to these AI applications. It's a protocol that just defines how whatever you are building as a developer for that integration piece, and that AI application, talk to each other. </p><p>"It's a very boring specification, but what it enables is hopefully ... something that looks like the current API ecosystem, but for LLM interactions."</p><p><strong>Yoko: "</strong>I really love the analogy with the API ecosystem, because they give people a mental model of how the ecosystem evolves ... Before, you may have needed a different spec to query Salesforce versus query HubSpot. Now you can use similarly defined API schema to do that.</p><p>"And then when I saw MCP earlier in the year, it was very interesting in that it almost felt like a standard interface for the agent to interface with LLMs. It's like, 'What are the set of things that the agent wants to execute on that it has never seen before? What kind of context does it need to make these things happen?' When I tried it out, it was just super powerful and I no longer have to build one tool per client. I now can build just one MCP server, for example, for sending emails, and I use it for everything on Cursor, on Claude Desktop, on Goose."</p><p>Learn more:</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/a-deep-dive-into-mcp-and-the-future-of-ai-tooling/" target="_blank">A Deep Dive Into MCP and the Future of AI Tooling</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/what-is-an-ai-agent/" target="_blank">What Is an AI Agent?</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/benchmarking-ai-agents-on-full-stack-coding/" target="_blank">Benchmarking AI Agents on Full-Stack Coding</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/agent-experience-building-an-open-web-for-the-ai-era/" target="_blank">Agent Experience: Building an Open Web for the AI Era</a></p><p>Follow everyone on X:</p><p><a href="https://x.com/dsp_" target="_blank">David Soria Parra</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/stuffyokodraws" target="_blank">Yoko Li</a></p>

            Hugo Bowne-Anderson hosts a panel discussion from the MLOps World and Generative AI Summit in Austin, exploring the long-term growth of AI by distinguishing real problem-solving from trend-based solutions. If you're navigating the evolving landscape of generative AI, productionizing models, or questioning the hype, this episode dives into the tough questions shaping the field.
The panel features:  
- Ben Taylor (Jepson) (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jepsontaylor/)">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jepsontaylor/)</a> – CEO and Founder at VEOX Inc., with experience in AI exploration, genetic programming, and deep learning.  
- Joe Reis (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/)">https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/)</a> – Co-founder of Ternary Data and author of Fundamentals of Data Engineering.  
- Juan Sequeda (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansequeda/)">https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansequeda/)</a> – Principal Scientist and Head of AI Lab at Data.World, known for his expertise in knowledge graphs and the semantic web.  
The discussion unpacks essential topics such as:  
- The shift from prompt engineering to goal engineering—letting AI iterate toward well-defined objectives.  
- Whether generative AI is having an electricity moment or more of a blockchain trajectory.  
- The combinatorial power of AI to explore new solutions, drawing parallels to AlphaZero redefining strategy games.  
- The POC-to-production gap and why AI projects stall.  
- Failure modes, hallucinations, and governance risks—and how to mitigate them.  
- The disconnect between executive optimism and employee workload.  
Hugo also mentions his upcoming workshop on escaping Proof-of-Concept Purgatory, which has evolved into a Maven course "Building LLM Applications for Data Scientists and Software Engineers" launching in January (<a href="https://maven.com/hugo-stefan/building-llm-apps-ds-and-swe-from-first-principles?utm_campaign=8123d0&utm_medium=partner&utm_source=instructor).">https://maven.com/hugo-stefan/building-llm-apps-ds-and-swe-from-first-principles?utm_campaign=8123d0&utm_medium=partner&utm_source=instructor).</a> Vanishing Gradient listeners can get 25% off the course (use the code VG25), with $1,000 in Modal compute credits included.
A huge thanks to Dave Scharbach and the Toronto Machine Learning Society for organizing the conference and to the audience for their thoughtful questions.
As we head into the new year, this conversation offers a reality check amidst the growing AI agent hype.

            While Silicon Valley chases unicorns, Josh Wolfe hunts for something far more elusive: scientific breakthroughs that could change civilization. As co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital, he's looking for the kind of science that turns impossible into inevitable. Josh doesn’t just invest in the future—he sees it coming before almost anyone else. 
 
In this conversation, we explore: 

The rapid evolution of AI and potential bottlenecks slowing its growth 

The geopolitical battle for technological dominance and rise of sovereign AI models 

How advances in automation, robotics, and defence are shifting global power dynamics 

Josh's unfiltered thoughts on Tesla and Elon Musk 

AI's revolution of medical research 

Parenting in a tech-dominated world 

How AI is forcing us to rethink creativity, intellectual property, and human intelligence itself 

Why the greatest risk isn't AI itself—but our ability to separate truth from noise 

 
Despite the challenges ahead, Josh remains profoundly optimistic about human potential. He believes technology isn't replacing what makes us human—it's amplifying it. This episode will challenge how you think about innovation, risk, and the forces shaping our future. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, you can't afford to miss it. 
 
Josh Wolfe co-founded Lux Capital to support scientists and entrepreneurs who pursue counter-conventional solutions to the most vexing puzzles of our time. He previously worked in investment banking at Salomon Smith Barney and in capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Josh is a columnist with Forbes and Editor for the Forbes/Wolfe Emerging Tech Report.

            <p>In this episode we'll discuss how to use Github data as a network to extract insights about teamwork.</p> <p>Our guest, Gabriel Ramirez, manager of the notifications team at GitHub, will show how to apply network analysis to better understand and improve collaboration within his engineering team by analyzing GitHub metadata - such as pull requests, issues, and discussions - as a bipartite graph of people and projects.</p> <p>Some insights we'll discuss are how network centrality measures (like eigenvector and betweenness centrality) reveal organizational dynamics, how vacation patterns influence team connectivity, and how decentralizing communication hubs can foster healthier collaboration. </p> <p>Gabriel’s open-source project, GH Graph Explorer, enables other managers and engineers to extract, visualize, and analyze their own GitHub activity using tools like Python, Neo4j, Gephi and LLMs for insight generation, but always remember – don't take the results on face value. Instead, use the results to guide your qualitative investigation. </p>

            What happens when one of the most legendary minds in tech delves deep into the real workings of modern AI? A 2-hour long masterclass that you don’t want to miss.
 
Bret Taylor, current chairman of OpenAI, unpacks why AI is transforming software engineering forever, how founders can survive acquisition (he’s done it twice), and why the true bottlenecks in AI aren’t what most think. Drawing on his extensive experiences at Facebook, Google, Twitter and more, he explains why the next phase of AI won’t just be about building better models—it’s about creating entirely new ways for us to work with them. Bret exposes the reality gap between what AI insiders understand and what everyone else believes.

            What if the cost of writing code dropped to zero — but the cost of understanding it skyrocketed?
In this episode, Hugo sits down with Joe Reis to unpack how AI tooling is reshaping the software development lifecycle — from experimentation and prototyping to deployment, maintainability, and everything in between.
Joe is the co-author of Fundamentals of Data Engineering and a longtime voice on the systems side of modern software. He’s also one of the sharpest critics of “vibe coding” — the emerging pattern of writing software by feel, with heavy reliance on LLMs and little regard for structure or quality.
We dive into:
    • Why “vibe coding” is more than a meme — and what it says about how we build today
    • How AI tools expand the surface area of software creation — for better and worse
    • What happens to technical debt, testing, and security when generation outpaces understanding
    • The changing definition of “production” in a world of ephemeral, internal, or just-good-enough tools
    • How AI is flattening the learning curve — and threatening the talent pipeline
    • Joe’s view on what real craftsmanship means in an age of disposable code
This conversation isn’t about doom, and it’s not about hype. It’s about mapping the real, messy terrain of what it means to build software today — and how to do it with care.

            Flo Crivello, CEO of AI agent platform Lindy, provides a candid deep dive into the current state of AI agents, cutting through hype to reveal what's actually working in production versus what remains challenging. The conversation explores practical implementation details including model selection, fine-tuning, RAG systems, tool design philosophy, and why most successful "AI agents" today are better described as intelligent workflows with human-designed structure. Flo shares insights on emerging capabilities like more open-ended agents, discusses his skepticism about extrapolating current progress trends too far into the future, and explains why scaffolding will remain critical even as we approach AGI. This technical discussion is packed with practical nuggets for AI engineers and builders working on agent systems.

Plus: spam filters, a Photoshop addiction, and one very cheesy story (dairy-free).</p><p><strong>Links mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><ul><li>Newsletter: <a href="https://postgresweekly.com/">Postgres Weekly</a></li><li>Cooperpress: <a href="https://cooperpress.com/publications/">List of newsletters</a></li><li>Newsletter: <a href="https://postgresweekly.com/issues/604">Latest issue of Postgres Weekly on Jun 19, 2025</a></li><li>Newsletter: <a href="https://postgresweekly.com/issues/296">Postgres Weekly issue with horrible graphic</a></li><li>Newsletter: <a href="https://postgresweekly.com/issues/1">Very first issue of Postgres Weekly on Mar 13, 2013</a></li><li>Newsletter: <a href="https://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a>, the first Cooperpress newsletter</li><li>Book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-Professional-Peter-Cooper/dp/1484212797">Beginning Ruby Third Edition</a>, by Peter Cooper</li><li>Podcast episode: <a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/episodes/how-i-got-started-as-a-developer-in-postgres-with-david-rowley">How I got started as a developer (& in Postgres) with David Rowley</a></li><li>Feed reader: <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a></li><li>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin">feedbin/feedbin</a></li><li>Feed reader: <a href="https://feeder.co/">Feeder</a></li><li>Email testing software: <a href="https://www.litmus.com/">Litmus</a></li><li>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml">MGML markup language for email</a></li><li>Paper: <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M85-95.pdf">The Design of Postgres</a></li><li>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">PGRX for building Postgres extensions in Rust</a></li><li>Podcast news: <a href="https://podnews.net/">Podnews.net</a> for daily briefings about podcasts</li><li>Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a></li><li>Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a></li><li>Cal invite: <a href="https://aka.ms/TalkingPostgres-Ep29-cal">LIVE recording of Ep29 of Talking Postgres</a> to happen on Wed Jul 9, 2025</li></ul>

            <p>Bridging the Gap Between AI and Business Data // MLOps Podcast #325 with Deepti Srivastava, Founder and CEO at Snow Leopard.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Join the Community: <a href="https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn</p><p>Get">https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn</p><p>Get</a> the newsletter: <a href="https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>//">https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>//</a> Abstract</p><p><br></p><p>I’m sure the MLOps community is probably aware – it's tough to make AI work in enterprises for many reasons, from data silos, data privacy and security concerns, to going from POCs to production applications. But one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today, that I particularly care about, is how to unlock the true potential of AI by leveraging a company’s operational business data. At Snow Leopard, we aim to bridge the gap between AI systems and critical business data that is locked away in databases, data warehouses, and other API-based systems, so enterprises can use live business data from any data source – whether it's database, warehouse, or APIs – in real time and on demand, natively. In this interview, I'd like to cover Snow Leopard’s intelligent data retrieval approach that can leverage business data directly and on-demand to make AI work.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>// Bio</p><p><br></p><p>Deepti is the founder and CEO of Snow Leopard AI, a platform that helps teams build AI apps using their live business data, on-demand. She has nearly 2 decades of experience in data platforms and infrastructure.</p><p>As Head of Product at Observable, Deepti led the 0→1 product and GTM strategy in the crowded data analytics market. Before that, Deepti was the founding PM for Google Spanner, growing it to thousands of internal customers (Ads, PlayStore, Gmail, etc.), before launching it externally as a seminal cloud database service. Deepti started her career as a distributed systems engineer in the RAC database kernel at Oracle.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>// Related Links</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.snowleopard.ai/</p><p><br></p><p>AI">https://www.snowleopard.ai/</p><p><br></p><p>AI</a> SQL Data Analyst // Donné Stevenson - <a href="https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~">https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~</a> ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href="https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join">https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join</a> our Slack community [<a href="https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow">https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow</a> us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](<a href="https://x.com/mlopscommunity)">https://x.com/mlopscommunity)</a> or [LinkedIn](<a href="https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)]">https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)]</a> </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [<a href="https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps">https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps</a> Swag/Merch: [<a href="https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect">https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect</a> with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Deepti on LinkedIn: /thedeepti/</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Timestamps:</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[00:00] Deepti's preferred coffee</p><p>[00:49] MLflow vs Kubeflow Debate</p><p>[04:58] GenAI Data Integration Challenges</p><p>[09:02] GenAI Sidecar Spicy Takes</p><p>[14:07] Troubleshooting LLM Hallucinations</p><p>[19:03] AI Overengineering and Hype</p><p>[25:06] Self-Serve Analytics Governance</p><p>[33:29] Dashboards vs Data Quality</p><p>[37:06] Agent Database Context Control</p><p>[43:00] LLM as Orchestrator</p><p>[47:34] Tool Call Ownership Clarification</p><p>[51:45] MCP Server Challenges</p><p>[56:52] Wrap up</p>

            Amjad Masad (@amasad), founder and CEO of Replit, and Yohei Nakajima (@yoheinakajima), Managing Partner at Untapped Capital, joined Village Global partner Ben Casnocha for a live masterclass with Village Global founders.<br></br><br></br>Takeaways:<b><br></br></b><ul><li>AI agents are rapidly evolving, with coding and deep research agents showing the most traction today. But general-purpose assistants are still brittle â trip-planning and high-context tasks remain hard.<br></br><br></br></li><li>Replit Agent shows how quickly full-stack applications can be built today, sometimes in under an hour â even by non-technical users. What matters most isnât a CS degree, itâs traits like curiosity, grit, and systems thinking.<br></br><br></br></li><li>Many AI startups are too quick to claim âmoatsâ when most donât really have one. True defensibility requires deep domain insight, unique data, and the right founder traits.<br></br><br></br></li><li>The rise of vertical AI agents is compelling â specialists outperform general agents for now. A real AGI will change everything, and itâs so disruptive itâs not even worth planning around.<br></br><br></br></li><li>The best investors still look for timeless traits: hard-charging, resourceful founders, attacking stagnant industries. AI changes a lot â but not what makes a great early-stage team.<br></br><br></br></li><li>Tools like Replit are making vibe coding (yes, even for non-coders) a superpower. From executive dashboards to lightweight Crunchbase clones, agents are already creating real enterprise value.<br></br><br></br></li><li>Donât over-engineer AI use cases. Start with internal tools or things youâve always wanted to build.

            Jesse Hoogland and Daniel Murfet, founders of Timaeus, introduce their mathematically rigorous approach to AI safety through "developmental interpretability" based on Singular Learning Theory. They explain how neural network loss landscapes are actually complex, jagged surfaces full of "singularities" where models can change internally without affecting external behavior—potentially masking dangerous misalignment. Using their Local Learning Coefficient measure, they've demonstrated the ability to identify critical phase changes during training in models up to 7 billion parameters, offering a complementary approach to mechanistic interpretability. This work aims to move beyond trial-and-error neural network training toward a more principled engineering discipline that could catch safety issues during training rather than after deployment.

<p>In this episode of Data Science at Home, we explore the fascinating world of neuromorphic computing — a brain-inspired approach to computation that could reshape the future of AI and robotics. The episode breaks down how neuromorphic systems differ from conventional AI architectures like transformers and LLMs, diving into spiking neural networks (SNNs), their benefits in energy efficiency and real-time processing, and their limitations in training and scalability. Real-world applications are highlighted, including low-power drones, hearing aids, and event-based cameras. Francesco closes with a vision of hybrid systems where neuromorphic chips and LLMs coexist, blending biological inspiration with modern AI.</p>

            <p>We interview Professor Christopher Summerfield from Oxford University about his new book "These Strange New Minds: How AI Learned to Talk and What It". AI learned to understand the world just by reading text - something scientists thought was impossible. You don't need to see a cat to know what one is; you can learn everything from words alone. This is "the most astonishing scientific discovery of the 21st century."People are split: some refuse to call what AI does "thinking" even when it outperforms humans, while others believe if it acts intelligent, it is intelligent. Summerfield takes the middle ground - AI does something genuinely like human reasoning, but that doesn't make it human.Sponsor messages:========Google Gemini: Google Gemini features Veo3, a state-of-the-art AI video generation model in the Gemini app. Sign up at <a href="https://gemini.google.comTufa">https://gemini.google.comTufa</a> AI Labs are hiring for ML Engineers and a Chief Scientist in Zurich/SF.

            <p class="whitespace-normal">Most people who leave Wall Street after twenty years either retire or find another way to make a lot of money. Chris Arnade chose to walk through cities most travelers never truly see. What emerged from this approach is a unique form of street-level sociology that has attracted a devoted following on <a href="https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/">Substack</a>. Arnade's work suggests that our most sophisticated methods of understanding the world might be missing something essential that can only be discovered by moving slowly through space and letting strangers tell you, their stories.</p> <p class="whitespace-normal">Tyler and Chris discuss how Beijing and Shanghai reveal different forms of authoritarian control through urban design, why Seoul's functional dysfunction makes it more appealing than Tokyo's efficiency, favorite McDonald’s locations around the world, the dimensions for properly assessing a city’s walkability, what Chris packs for long urban jaunts, why he’s not interested in walking the countryside, what travel has taught him about people and culture, what makes the Faroe Islands and El Paso so special, where he has no desire to go, the good and bad of working on Wall Street, the role of pigeons and snapping turtles in his life, finding his 1,000 true fans on Substack, whether museums are interesting, what set him on this current journey, and more.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Read a <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/chris-arnade/">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/ob5-SXLkRO8">full video</a> on the new dedicated CWT channel.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Recorded February 27th, 2025</em></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Help keep the show ad free by <a href="https://mercatus.donorsupport.co/page/podcastgift?utm_source=cwt+podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=shownotes"> donating</a> today!</span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong> Other ways to connect</strong></span></p> <ul> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/cowenconvos">X</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en">Instagram</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen">Tyler</a> on X</span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow <a href="https://x.com/Chris_arnade">Chris</a> on X</span></li> <li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a class="c-link" href="https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-stringify-link="https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Sign up for our newsletter</a></span></li> <li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt">Discord</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Email us: <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-expanded="false" data-remove-tab-index="true">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts">here</a>.</span></li> </ul> <p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Photo Credit: Bryan Jones</span></em></p>
