            What if building software felt more like composing than coding?
In this episode, Hugo and Greg explore how LLMs are reshaping the way we think about software development—from deterministic programming to a more flexible, prompt-driven, and collaborative style of building. It’s not just hype or grift—it’s a real shift in how we express intent, reason about systems, and collaborate across roles.
Hugo speaks with Greg Ceccarelli—co-founder of SpecStory, former CPO at Pluralsight, and Director of Data Science at GitHub—about the rise of software composition and how it changes the way individuals and teams create with LLMs.
We dive into:
- Why software composition is emerging as a serious alternative to traditional coding
- The real difference between vibe coding and production-minded prototyping
- How LLMs are expanding who gets to build software—and how
- What changes when you focus on intent, not just code
- What Greg is building with SpecStory to support collaborative, traceable AI-native workflows
- The challenges (and joys) of debugging and exploring with agentic tools like Cursor and Claude

            On today's show Andrew and Bill begin with PRC perspectives on the past two weeks of attacks on Iran. Topics include: Dispelling notions that U.S. involvement was welcomed by the PRC, why regional stability in the Middle East is stressed in every PRC statement, and how Iran and other PRC partners may view China's inaction over the last few weeks. From there: President William Lai delivers the first of ten speeches on national unity in Taiwan, the PRC offers a blistering response, and it may be time to brace for a rocky summer. At the end: The London agreement between the U.S. and China is under duress, EU leaders sound increasingly hawkish as the EU-China summit looms, Trump gives TikTok its third extension, and Congressional testimony brings the PRC swimming scandal back to the spotlight.

        <div class="description">
            <p>Richard Moot: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Square Developer Podcast. I'm your host, Richard Moot, head of developer relations here at Square. And today I'm joined by my fellow developer relations engineer, Rizel, who's over working on Block Open Source. Hi Rizel, welcome to the podcast.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Hey, Richard. Thanks for having me. And I know it's so cool. We're like coworkers, but on different teams</p><p>Richard Moot: And you get to work on some of the, I'll admit I'm a little bit jealous. You get to work on some of the cool open source stuff, but I still get to poke around in there occasionally. But today we wanted to talk about one of our most recent releases is Goose, and I would like you to do the honors of, give us the quick pitch. What is Goose?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Goose is an on machine AI agent and it's open source. So when I say on machine, it's local. Unlike a lot of other AI tools that you use via the cloud, you have everything stored on your computer, private, you have control over the data, and you get to interact with different lms. You can choose whichever you want, whether it's GPT, sonnet, 3.5, whatever you prefer, you get to bring it.</p><p>Richard Moot: Awesome. And so I'm going to hopefully give a little bit more because I want to just kind of clarify for Square developers who might be coming in, they're like, they're just building other APIs, SDKs, trying to extend stuff for square sellers. So when we're talking about an agent, an agent, I always end up thinking the matrix, the agents and the matrix. And from what I understand, it's not too far off. You give it instructions and it will actually go and do things on your machine for you write two files, edit files, run commands. It's almost like doing things that a person could do on your computer for you.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yes, exactly. That's a really good description. It doesn't just edit code for you. It can control your system. So I had it dimmed, the lights on my computer open different applications. You can really just automate anything even if you didn't know how to code.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, I mean that's one of the things that I didn't even really think about when I first tried Goose. So one of the fun benefits of working here at Block is that I got to have fun with it before it actually went live. And one thing that I didn't really think about until I tried the desktop client and I forgot to allow the plug, there's two different ways you can interact with it. There's the CLI and the terminal, and then there's a desktop client, which I think right now works on Mac os.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yes,</p><p>Richard Moot: I know there's big requests and to have it work in more than just Windows.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah. Yeah. Right now, I mean we do have what I think is a working version of Windows, but the experience for the build time is not great. So we're still working through that.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, well, having my own wrestling with working with the Windows sub Linux, I only really think of it as WSL. I've had so many headaches of trying to deal with networking and connecting and when do I need to switch to the power show versus a terminal, and it's all the reason I end up falling back to doing all of my development on my Mac.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah. I haven't used the Windows computer since I was an IT support person. I don't even know what the new developments are now.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, I mean I recently got burned by that where I didn't realize that in order to do certain virtualization stuff, you had to have a specific version of Windows, like some professional version, and then that enabled virtualization to run a VM of something interesting.</p><p>I think since then they've baked in the Windows sub Linux thing, which is basically just running Ubuntu in a virtualization for you. But that was an eyeopener, but thankfully Microsoft's working on fixing these things, but we digress. So coming back to Goose and what is it that most people have that you've sort of seen from the community as they've been starting to try it out and use Goose?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, I mean I just see people, well, a lot of it is mainly developers. That's the larger side of just using it to automate a lot of the tasks that they are doing. Maybe setting up, what am I trying to say, the boilerplate for their code or just sometimes other different things. I see people wanting to build local models and just in general or doing things with their kids, but I've also seen people doing silly experiments. This is where I find a lot of fun where people are having Goose talk to Goose or having a team of different, I guess geese, a team of agents and they're basically running a whole bunch of stuff. So they had one Goose be the PM and it was instructing all the engineer agents to perform different tasks. So it's a varied amount of things, but a lot of people are just trying to make their lives easier and have Goose do the mundane task in the background while they do the creative things. I've just been doing fun silly stuff. Like I had Goose play tic-tac-toe with me just for fun. I just wanted to see if it could do that and that was cool. Yeah.</p><p>Richard Moot: Have you beat it yet?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Every time I'm disappointed.</p><p>Richard Moot: You think it'd be way more advanced? I mean tech to can kind of, if I'm not mistaken, I think based on who goes first, it can be a determined game as long as you play with perfect strategy.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, I told it to play competitively. I'm still working on the perfect prompt. You always let me win Goose what's going on.</p><p>Richard Moot: Maybe that's part of the underlying LLMs is that they want to be helpful and so they think they're being helpful by letting you win, otherwise you wouldn't have fun.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: That's true.</p><p>Richard Moot: Well, one of the things I was very fascinated by when first trying out the desktop client versus the CLI, because I habitually used the CLI version, but when I first opened up the desktop client, I had asked, what is it that you can do? And one of the things that it suggested that never even occurred to me was using Apple Scripts to run certain automations on your system. And I immediately just went, okay, can you organize my downloads folder and put everything? And it just immediately put everything in organized folders. And that's something I used to, I mean years ago, write my own quick little scripts to be like, oh, I need to move all these CSVs into someplace and PDFs. And it just immediately did it for me and it was just, that was amazing because now I can actually find where the certain things are.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: That's so awesome. Yeah, I think you might've been using the computer controller extension, and that might be my favorite so far just because of, oh my gosh, it could actually, it's not just writing code for me. I'm like, okay, cool. There's other stuff that can do that Cursor does that as well, but it can tap into my computer system if I give it permission and move things around. I did a computer controller extension tutorial and I was just making it do silly stuff. Like I mentioned, it dimmed my computer screen. It opened up Safari and found classical music to play it, did some research on AI agents for me and put it in A CSV and then it turned back on the lights. It's so cool. I can just tell it, go do my own work for me and I'll it back.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, that's great. And so you touched on something that I think is kind of an interesting part about it, and I feel like I want to come back to the part to really emphasize GOOSE is an open source project, and so it allows you to attach all of those various LLMs to sort of power the experience. But what you just touched on there is the extensions. So the way that it can do these things, could you tell us a little bit about what are extensions and how are they used by either Goose or the LLM? What is the relationship there?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, so extensions are basically, I guess you can think of it as extending it to different applications or different use cases. And we're doing that through a protocol called the Model Context Protocol, which Anthropic and us have been partnering on. And basically it allows any AI agent to kind of have access to different data. So for example, there's a Figma MCP or a model context protocol, and you can connect GOOSE to that MCP and tell it, Hey, here's some designs that I have, and Goose will be able to look at those and copy it rather than when you're maybe working with something like chat GBT, you have to go and give it context and be like, Hey, chat GBT, I'm working on this. Here's how this goes. And it takes up a lot of time. It'll just jump right in. And like you were saying, it's open source, so anybody can make MCP, you can connect it to any MCP out there that, I mean, some of them have to be honest, some CPS that are out there since it's open source, they don't all work, but the ones that do, you can connect it to Goose.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah. And so that's kind of like what you were originally talking about, the computer controller one.</p><p>Richard Moot: I'm going to hopefully describe this in a way that can make this visual for those that are listening in. But when you're using GOOSE in the terminal, when you first ever install it, it'll run you through a configuration of, Hey, it's basically setting up your profile and it says, which LLM do you want to connect to? And then you can kind of select from there and then it'll say, give me your credentials. And then after that you can get the option to, well actually maybe I'm jumping the gun here. I think it just gets you through storing that. And then you can have the option of once Goose is configured, you can toggle on certain extensions, extensions that are included, and then there's a process to actually go find these other ones that are published elsewhere and then add them in, right?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yes, that's correct. We have your built-in extensions, like the developer extension, computer controller memory, and then you have the option to reach out to other extensions or even build your own custom extension and plug it in as well.</p><p>Richard Moot: Gotcha. And so the one I know that is the key one that's included with GOOSE is the developer extension. That's what does all the basic developer actions that you would think of, and then computer controller, that's kind of the one for doing more. Maybe tell me how is computer controller different than developer?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, so developer extension, it has the ability to run, shell command Shells scripts, so it'll go ahead and you say, create this file. It'll say touch create this file. It'll add the code for you in the places that it needs to. Whereas the computer controller, the intention of that is that it's supposed to be able to scrape the web, do different web interactions, be able to control your system, and then this is all automating things or even do automation scripts like you had mentioned before. These are all automating things for people who may not feel as comfortable coding, but they want to automate things within their system. That's the intention of the computer controller.</p><p>Richard Moot: Gotcha. And I'm curious, as this has been out there and having two different versions, I don't really want to say two different versions, two different ways of interacting with Goose with the desktop and the CLI, the desktop is really great for those that might not be more comfortable opening up a terminal. Have you seen folks coming in who are maybe less technical, who've been trying to actually use it through this way?</p><p>Richard Moot: Just curious all the various types of people that have been coming in and adopting or playing around with Goose.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah. Well first side note, even though I'm comfortable with the terminal, I like using the desktop. I just think it looks more visually appealing for me. But I have seen people in Discord, I think there was a set of health professionals that they were part of a hackathon and they were using GOOSE to build whatever their submissions were. I don't know exactly what, but I thought that was interesting that they're going to build tools and submit to a hackathon even though they're not solely software engineers. So that's one example.</p><p>Richard Moot: Interesting. So it's been really interesting seeing all of the different ways that people have building on it. And I mean it's been pretty exciting seeing how people have really started to just start using it. One of the things I thought was interesting was it seemed like initially some people just didn't quite understand, and I'm sure there's just work to be done in general, not just for us, but for people trying to use agents that I think a lot of people have assumed initially like, oh, where's the LLM? Why is there no thing bundled with this? I feel like I can't do anything. And we're like, no, you have to connect it to something else. But the one that got me the most interested was trying to get it to talk to a local LLM. And so I've tinkered with this over the past couple of weekends of running a llama, getting a model running. But I will admit that I hit my own endpoint where I was like, okay, I have an LLM running, but it doesn't really work with the tool calling.</p><p>I think that's something maybe we talk a little bit, what is it tool calling is like that thing that how it uses the extensions. But maybe you can tell us a little bit about what is tool calling and why is it so important?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, I mean a lot of things you said that I want to touch on. First off agents, I think from not understanding how Goose will work, I think agents are still a fairly new concept and everybody is saying, oh, this is what an agent is, and they all have their different definitions. So when I first used Goose as well, I was a little bit confused. I was like, what is this supposed to do? I think similarly when Devin came out, people were like, this is not working how I thought it would. So that just happens. But yes, open source using Goose with an open source LLM is so powerful because Goose is an open source local AI agent, and then you have the local LLMs that you can leverage it with. So you can own your data and you don't even need internet to have the LLMs running.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: But it is difficult. And like you said, tool calling. I am excited about this. I just came off of livestream with an engineer from alama. First off, the way he described tool calling was interesting. He said, it's not how I thought of it, but he was saying it's kind of how the LLM learns what it should or can do. So it's kind of like, oh, I have these set of tools here. Which one should I use for what I'm going to do? So let's say you told somebody I want to look up, or I want to go on a flight to, I don't know, Istanbul, I don't know why I picked that. What flights are available, how long will it take me? So then</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: An agent will be like, oh, tools do I have? And it might say, oh, I have a find flights tool and I have a MAP tool and I have this. So in order to find the flight, it might use that flights tool and in order to figure out the distance, it might use the MAPS tool or something like that. So that's kind of how it would work and it, I think it refines the results that it would have rather than looking at all these different things, it's like, okay, I'm going to use this particular tool and get this particular output. I learned a lot about open source models working with Goose or any agent, you have to, it's a lot of different prompting tips. First off, it's best probably to ask the open source LLM what access or what tools do I have access to? Because Open Source L LMS are much smaller, so they have a smaller context window and they're not able to interact with an agent like the cloud ones. They have so much more larger content with those, so they're able to take in more memory and stuff like that. So it's like I only have this amount, so let's get to what we need to do. Show me what tools are available. I'll grab that particular tool that's needed. And then another suggestion for when building an agent, and I think Goose will probably go in this direction to help improve the experience of working with open source. LLMs is having structured output. So the structured output would tell it kind of what it can and can't do and how the format of it would be printed out.</p><p>Richard Moot: Interesting.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: I know I said a lot.</p><p>Richard Moot: No, no, no, that was great because it had me wondering with certain, when I started messing with one of the open source models and then I was trying to use it, I think the open source model I found was from somebody within Block who actually tried to fine tune a version of Deep Seek to be like, oh yeah, this one will work with tool calling. But then I think I was realizing I still needed probably an extension for it to actually make use of it because, and I think that's the part where maybe I misunderstood how these things work, but I'm sure that there's things that Goose does that it maybe tells the LLM almost pretext that is sent in the context. So before you even write your prompt, it has things that it will sort of give to be like, Hey, you have tools available to you or there's these tools. And so you might not see that in the terminal or in the desktop, but it's actually sort of adding these things at the beginning or maybe the end of the context to say, Hey, here's some tools available to you. Make sure that you use them. I'm oversimplifying, I'm sure, but that's kind of how I'm guessing that that might work.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: That's how I seen it. So I looked at the logs because I wanted to really demo. I had no clue coming back from maternity leave that there was this little not necessarily working or trying to say obstacle, a little obstacle to work with open source LLMs and the agent. So I was like, oh, I'm ready to go. I'm going to go ahead and demo this live. And I realized, oh my gosh, it doesn't work perfectly. So I was looking at the logs and it does have a system prompt in the beginning where I didn't use deep seek like you did. I used Quinn 2.5 and it'll say in the beginning, you're a helpful assistant, you have access to computer controller and developer extension, and you can do this, this, and this. I think another limitation is our hardware as well. So even though it's on a local device, and I mean it's supposed to work on a local device, our local devices might not have enough RAM or memory. I have a 64 gigabyte, but the person that came on the live stream with me, he had 128, so that worked much better. So that might've been a limitation for you as well. And even though the system prompt already told it what extensions it would have, we both had a better result when we started off the conversation saying, Hey, what tools do you have access to? And it probably referred to the system prompt and then went ahead and printed it out to us.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, yeah. And when I was tinkering with this, I actually was putting, I took an old gaming laptop basically set it up with, I converted it from Windows to Linux and it works reasonably well. It's still a little bit too slow for what I would actually want to be using it. So I have my regular gaming computer that I've actually, so when I want to mess with this, I actually just run a alarm on that when it's on, and then I use it as sort of a remote server and it's usable at that point. I think tokens don't fly through with the cloud LLMs. I mean it's still kind of slowish, but it's usable. And I think it's really fun to try out the local LLM stuff just, I mean as a developer, it gives me this mild peace of mind of my data's not going anywhere, so it feels safer somehow.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, you're such a tinkerer. I love that.</p><p>Richard Moot: Oh, I tinker with way too many things, network configurations, running clusters locally on my home lab, all stuff that I don't think I've ever used professionally, but I just love learning about this stuff.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: I love that. I love that.</p><p>Richard Moot: So that kind of leads me one other thing that I'm interested in and I want to clarify. Not going to try to go into the realm of tips about using LLMs in augmenting our development workflows. And I think we're both in a similar camp of being in Devereux. It's really fun to just be like, I'm going to use this to start a new project or work in a language that I'm not usually familiar with and maybe see what I can build. I'm curious in terms of unprofessional tips, just things that you're sort of learning intuitively as you interact with it, how has it changed for you when you first started working with LLMs with doing software development to now? Have you ever noticed how you approach things a little bit differently?</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: That's a really good question. I haven't thought about it. I know when I, let me think because when I started using, my first experience with LLMs was like GitHub copilot and I made this whole playbook for people to use. I was like, make sure you have detailed examples and stuff like that, but how has it changed now?</p><p>Richard Moot: I'll give you an example. So to maybe help get your creative juices flowing on it. I know it's kind of coming out of left field, but when I first started using LLMs, I would just be like, Hey, can you build me this particular function? I think my first interaction was probably similar when I first used GitHub copilot and I was just doing tab completions and be like, I thought it was really cool that I could write a comment and describing the function that I want, and then I would start to write the function and then it would complete it out, and then I'd maybe have to edit a few things. And then once, I think it was when I first started using Goose is the first time I really tried one shotting things to be like build me an entire auth service for this app. And then I have now kind of swung back the other way a little bit where I tend to want to do a little bit more prompting when I want to do more of those one shots.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Interesting.</p><p>Richard Moot: But I've found that if I scaffold out half of it, maybe create the initial files and a single function or something and then it kind of fills in the rest, I have found it tends to work a little bit better. There's a few other tips that I can go into, but I don't know if that sort of helps. And that's how I've changed a little bit in how I've been using it because I've found that when you try doing the one shotting, it can just be too much that it's trying to do. And I feel like also it's too much context, especially I think one tip that I've heard continually with Goose and with others have a very clear what you considered a finished point and then move into a new context. Otherwise you can kind of go off the rails pretty fast.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, okay. I'll say this. I think my experience might be a little bit different just because when copilot came out, I had to demo GitHub copilot. So I was already thinking of, okay, how do I do this one-shot prompt that'll build out this whole thing so that people can be super impressed with me? So I think I was doing a lot of one-shot prompts and I probably brought over some of that learning from there. But</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: I think one thing I've been learning with building out the tutorials for Goose is kind of like what you're saying, how do I not let it get the context mixed up but still do a one-shot prompt? Because a lot of our tutorials, it's like we want to keep them short and sweet, so how do I make it do multiple things without overwhelming it or making it just fail? Sometimes it's like, I don't know what you want me to do, or it goes over the context limit. I leverage Goose hints a lot. So a lot of those different, most AI agents and AI tools have goose hints, cursor rules. I think Klein has its own thing as well. I dunno if you say Klein or Clean or whatever, but I dunno.</p><p>Richard Moot: I don't know what it is either.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Oh, okay. But they all have their own little, here's context for longer repeatable prompts. That way I use up less of the context window and I don't have to keep repeating myself like, Hey, make sure you set up this next JS thing. I'm already writing. We're going to use next JS and types script. We're going to use Tailwind or whatever it is, and then I can jump directly into the prompt that I want to do. And another thing I do, I don't know if this is weird, sometimes I ask Goose, how would you improve this prompt? I'll be like, I wrote this prompt and it failed. I'll open a new session. I'm like, how would you have improved this prompt? And it might give me a shorter one. So I don't know if I have these rules in my head, but I kind of just been really, really more experimental than I was in the past, I guess.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, I think that's a really good thing to call out. I think that that's something that I had learned over time where even though I try to figure out a way to codify an approach, but I end up realizing these are just, I mean, it's weird. I feel like I'm going to describe this, I am the LLM, but they're tools and then you figure out, yeah, I try this one and it's not quite doing what I want, so I'm going to go try something else. And then I think what you said there was one that I've even tried and I didn't really even think about is so go, sometimes I'll switch LLM providers and I'd be like,I'm trying to do this over here and it's not working, and I give it, it gives me something else as a different context. I'm like, well, let's try and see if I feed that back over here, if that gets me the result I'm wanting. And so yeah, I think that's the biggest importance right now is to just be continually experimenting with it because I think as time goes on, we're going to end up learning different, I don't know, heuristics of shortcuts of trying to get what we want done. Sometimes I really like doing the one shots and then other times I'm like, I maybe scaffold something out and then I'm like, I'm just going to progressively iteratively work through this because I don't want it to. I think when I was trying to have it build an off service for an app, I was just too worried about it in one shoting it that I'd have one or two tiny bugs that are hard to catch somewhere.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: That's true.</p><p>Richard Moot: And then I was just like, I really don't want to have to be going back through all these different methods and figure out like, oh yeah, I'm actually handling the Jot token incorrectly here. I'd rather just sort of progressively work through and feel confident in it and then be like, okay, I'll give a concrete example of one where I was using this library, I think it was called, it's a one-time password library for node js. I didn't realize that it was kind of really outdated and not maintained, and I implemented it in this app that I was working on, and I realized it wasn't working in the way that I anticipated, and then I was like, oh, there's an updated version of this library somewhere else that's more well adopted and being maintained. And so I was writing out the conversion, but I only converted say one of the sign-in function, and then once I had that one converted, I basically told my LLM, Hey, I'm switching from this library to this library and I've already done this particular function. Can you go through and update all of the other ones to use this new library?</p><p>Richard Moot: It did it, I would say nearly perfectly, which is pretty amazing. So I always find there's these little ways that you can be like, yeah, I'm going to do some of the manual work because it'll give me that confidence, but then lean on the LLM when I'm like, okay, I feel like I've done enough that it can finish it for me.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: You know what? Now that you say more, it does make me think, I think I use a different workflow if I'm building versus I am doing developer advocacy work for it demoing or doing a tutorial. So if I am building, you're right, I probably first ask it what is its plan? And I do go more iteratively and I do try to do more of it and then let Goose jump in at certain areas. But if I'm doing a demonstration, I want it to be I do a one shot, which is an art in itself for it to be one shot and for it to be repeatable because AI is non-deterministic. So it could have worked with me once and I tried to demo it and then it never works again, and people were like, this didn't work. But yeah, I think that iterative process is really helpful for me when I say like, Hey, how are you going to go about this? And Okay, I'm going to do this part. You do this. And I always open up a new session when I feel like the conversation's been going long because I think, well, I know it loses context as it gets too big.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, totally. I couldn't agree more on that part, and in fact, I've talked with some coworkers who've had mixed experiences with trying to use LLMs in their development work, but I think the thing that we just touched on there is that you have to just be dynamic in how you would use it and understand that you might not use it the same way in every context. And that's definitely what I've also learned when I've built out a fun example app for developer advocacy, just to build a proof of concept for the rest of my team to understand, hey, we can build an example and say next JS or Nest js or view or something, and I'm just using it to be like, Hey, I want you to one shot this out to basically get this mostly working to share something, but that's not how I build it When I'm like, Hey, I want to make this published and official for people to consume to say this is the way that you adopt Square. I would approach that very differently when using the LLM because I'd probably be curating my function signatures a little bit better and like, oh, this looks really good and understandable, and then have it fill out the rest</p><p>Richard Moot: Versus just one shotting things. If I was just going to have a one shot things, I would just probably tell people coming to our platform, so here's Goose, here's your LLM, go ahead and one shot your app.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: That's all you need, just Goose. There you go. And I think you had mentioned a little earlier that different, sometimes you'll switch to a different LLM in addition to experimenting with those prompts. Different LLMs have different outputs, and I know on the roadmap we're planning to come out with, I guess different products come out with benches of here's how well this LLM works with our tool, so we're coming out with Goose Bench to say, okay, maybe if you want to do this type of process or build this type of app, then maybe Anthropics models might be best or maybe opening eyes or whatever.</p><p>Richard Moot: That would be really helpful because one other thing that I've been tinkering with when I try using an LLM for doing any kind of development work is I've actually, I think there's certain tools, I think one called Cursor New, but it basically just runs you through a series of give the project name a description, what libraries are using, and then it basically gives you prompts to feed in to create certain documents. But what I found interesting was the first one we'll do is say it'll help create a product requirements document, which I think we all call PRDs, but I'm just want to be super clear for people who might not know the lingo. And so I usually have it start out with creating the PRD, and then from there it'll create the code style guide and then it'll create your goose hints or cursor rules, and then I think finally it'll kind of create, I don't know how useful this one is, but it'll create a Read me of a progress tracker.</p><p>Richard Moot: That one I've found it's cool, but I've not found it to be totally useful because usually the only time it is useful is when I finally get to say the end of a task where I'm like, Hey, build out, scaffold out the project, and then at the end of it I say, go ahead and go update the progress file to clarify what has been built, what should be built next, and where are we at. Then I use that as the start of the next session of, Hey, check the progress thing to see where we are and what we need to build next, and then work from there. That's so smart. I like that it's really been useful for me, but at the same time, I would say by this fourth or fifth session, I don't know why it starts getting a little, I run into too many errors and I don't know if it's actually specific to the number of sessions or the particular feature that I'm building is maybe too complex and I need to spend more time breaking it into smaller pieces.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Interesting. I definitely, I want to try that on my own. I didn't think about saving it. I think the memory extension would do that as well for you maybe.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah, to be clear, I think in this instance I was using something like Cursor.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Okay.</p><p>Richard Moot: But I think I was wanting to try this with Goose. I do have the memory extension enabled, but I just haven't actually gotten to this is sort of what I've been doing on my own at home, but I definitely want to try this more with Goose, especially because Goose has goose hints and I can very easily convert my other rules to work for Goose. But yeah, it's been very useful for larger, more complex things that I've been building, but I still feel like it has its limitations.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, I like the challenge of figuring out what's stopping you and how do I get around this? And you're right, you did say you were using Cursor or some type of tool and I heard Goose in my head,</p><p>Richard Moot: But yeah, I found it really helpful just trying to just experiment with all the various different tools. There's a lot that I think all of us don't know. There's a lot of stuff to just keep figuring out. I just think that it's weird to say to someone like, Hey, I could tell you the different ways that you could use this, but I think right now most people should actually just figure out how it can work for them because I think if you go online, you can find people on all ends of the spectrum. There's some people they work on stuff that's so bespoke complex that they go, oh, LMS are just not useful for me. They're too bug ridden or the performance of the functions it creates isn't useful. I think those people are one end of the spectrum versus other of us who are like, oh my gosh, I spend most of my day doing architecture stuff like API architecture stuff, and so having an LLM to do the actual implementation of a design is huge unlock because I might come up with a great API design, but then I'm like, this is going to take me so long to code up and an LLM feels like a huge unlock,</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: And I really resonate with your point of figure out what works for you. You really just got to tinker with it and be like, I want to get this done and figure out how it'll apply to you because like you said, I could tell people one way, but I might not work in the same way as they do or I'm not working as complex stuff as them. Yeah,</p><p>Richard Moot: And not to anthropomorphize it too much, but I feel like it's probably not too dissimilar if somebody just said, Hey, out of nowhere they said, Hey, we gave you an assistant. You'd be like, I don't even know what I'm, you'd at first be like, what do I use the assistant for? Can you organize my files? It takes you a while to even figure out, okay, what can you do? What are you good at? You don't know until you actually have that, and so I think we all have to just start interacting with it and then we'll figure out where we actually want help. You might find out there's certain areas where we don't want it to help us in these things, but we do want it to help us in those other things.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Get to know the lm.</p><p>Richard Moot: Exactly. Yeah. Even the people who think, oh, I don't really like it for coding. You're like, yeah, but you might find out you hate writing super long complicated emails or reading super long, complicated emails. You'd be like, Hey, can you go ahead and give me the TLDR of this or write an email form? It can be that simple.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett</p><p>Sometimes I use LLMs to make sure my emails sound polite. Sometimes my emails don't come out polite, even though I'm not even throwing any shade, so if it sounds like I'm throwing shade, take it out.</p><p>Richard Moot: That's great. I think more people should be using that. Maybe I'm biased because being in the Devereux space, you get to interact with all kinds of folks.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yes, that's true.</p><p>Richard Moot: And they all have very different communication styles, not to name names. We did have one person who in this square community who I actually was very thankful for them, but they spent so much time just finding every single bug in our APIs, and it drove some people a little bit crazy like, oh my gosh, he found another one, but then I'm just sitting here just like, yeah, thank you. This is free qa. This is amazing. I'm going to keep encouraging this person to keep saying this stuff. I don't find it annoying in the least</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: I could get it. I could understand it on both sides. As an engineer, you're like, no more work, but as a developer advocate, you're like, yay, my product's getting improved,</p><p>Richard Moot: And it's validating. They love the product so much, they want it to be better, so of course, let's go do that.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: It's true. I love that.</p><p>Richard Moot: Yeah. Well, I think we're coming up on our time here. Thank you so much for coming here and telling us a little bit about Goose. I think here's probably a good point for us to sort of plug where can people go to learn more about Goose Blocks Open source or if they want to just sort of follow you to learn more about any of this stuff.</p><p>Rizel Scarlett: Yeah, I would, if I were an engineer or somebody interested in open source itself, I would go to github.com/block/goose, and if you wanted to go on the website or install it, I would go to block.github.io/goose and to find me on the internet, on any social media platform and Black gobys.</p><p>Richard Moot: Perfect, and I will also just do the extra plug of check out the Block, open Source YouTube, and if you want, you can also check out the Square Developer YouTube if you're interested in things on Square Developer, and if you are working on a project or you want to learn more about what you can build or what is available on Square, go to developer dot square up.com or you can follow us at Square Dev on X. Thank you so much for being here, and we'll see you next time.</p><p><br></br> </p>

            If we want to make progress toward AGI, we need a clear definition of intelligence—and a way to measure it.
In this episode, Hugo talks with Greg Kamradt, President of the ARC Prize Foundation, about ARC-AGI: a benchmark built on Francois Chollet’s definition of intelligence as “the efficiency at which you learn new things.” Unlike most evals that focus on memorization or task completion, ARC is designed to measure generalization—and expose where today’s top models fall short.
They discuss:
🧠 Why we still lack a shared definition of intelligence
🧪 How ARC tasks force models to learn novel skills at test time
📉 Why GPT-4-class models still underperform on ARC
🔎 The limits of traditional benchmarks like MMLU and Big-Bench
⚙️ What the OpenAI O₃ results reveal—and what they don’t
💡 Why generalization and efficiency, not raw capability, are key to AGI
Greg also shares what he’s seeing in the wild: how startups and independent researchers are using ARC as a North Star, how benchmarks shape the frontier, and why the ARC team believes we’ll know we’ve reached AGI when humans can no longer write tasks that models can’t solve.
This conversation is about evaluation—not hype. If you care about where AI is really headed, this one’s worth your time.

Whether he’s analyzing productivity slowdowns in the construction sector, exploring the impact of taxes on digital commerce, or poking holes in overconfident macro narratives, Goolsbee is consistently sharp, skeptical, and curious. A longtime professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, Goolsbee now brings that intellectual discipline—and a healthy dose of humor—to his role as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Tyler and Austan explore what theoretical frameworks Goolsbee uses for understanding inflation, why he’s skeptical of monetary policy rules, whether post-pandemic inflation was mostly from the demand or supply side, the proliferation of stablecoins and shadow banking, housing prices and construction productivity, how microeconomic principles apply to managing a regional Fed bank, whether the structure of the Federal Reserve system should change, AI's role in banking supervision and economic forecasting, stablecoins and CBDCs, AI's productivity potential over the coming decades, his secret to beating Ted Cruz in college debates, and more.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Read a <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/austan-goolsbee/">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/wvvP9sFANjM">full video</a> on the new dedicated Conversations with Tyler channel.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Recorded March 3rd, 2025</em></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Help keep the show ad free by <a href="https://mercatus.donorsupport.co/page/podcastgift?utm_source=cwt+podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=shownotes"> donating</a> today!</span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong> Other ways to connect</strong></span></p> <ul> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/cowenconvos">X</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en">Instagram</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen">Tyler</a> on X</span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow <a href="https://x.com/Austan_Goolsbee">Austan</a> on X</span></li> <li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a class="c-link" href="https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-stringify-link="https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Sign up for our newsletter</a></span></li> <li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt">Discord</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Email us: <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-expanded="false" data-remove-tab-index="true">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts">here</a>.</span></li> </ul>

            Director Danny Boyle famously shot his post-apocalyptic classic “28 Days Later” on Canon digital cameras, making it easier for him to capture eerie scenes of an abandoned London, and giving the movie’s fast-moving zombies a terrifying immediacy.  Also, LinkedIn users seem to have embraced AI,  but there’s one area that’s seen less uptake than expected, according to CEO Ryan Roslansky: the AI-generated suggestions for polishing your LinkedIn posts; Google's adding a slew of AI features to the Chromebook Plus line, including a search and text capture tool, NotebookLM, and a tool for simplifying text; European governments may be reconsidering their use of American technology and services, according to a new report in The New York Times; a Republican effort to prevent states from enforcing their own AI regulations cleared a key procedural hurdle on Saturday.

            Hugo speaks with Alex Strick van Linschoten, Machine Learning Engineer at ZenML and creator of a comprehensive LLMOps database documenting over 400 deployments. Alex's extensive research into real-world LLM implementations gives him unique insight into what actually works—and what doesn't—when deploying AI agents in production.
In this episode, we dive into:
- The current state of AI agents in production, from successes to common failure modes
- Practical lessons learned from analyzing hundreds of real-world LLM deployments
- How companies like Anthropic, Klarna, and Dropbox are using patterns like ReAct, RAG, and microservices to build reliable systems
- The evolution of LLM capabilities, from expanding context windows to multimodal applications
- Why most companies still prefer structured workflows over fully autonomous agents
We also explore real-world case studies of production hurdles, including cascading failures, API misfires, and hallucination challenges. Alex shares concrete strategies for integrating LLMs into your pipelines while maintaining reliability and control.
Whether you're scaling agents or building LLM-powered systems, this episode offers practical insights for navigating the complex landscape of LLMOps in 2025.

            <p>In this episode, John Waldmann, CEO of Homebase, shares how the 10-year-old SaaS company blew up its roadmap and rebuilt around AI—from culture to code. He walks us through the shift from 20-page PRDs to lightning-fast demos, reclaiming product leadership, and pushing teams into their “oh shit” moment with AI.</p><p>We explore the leadership reckoning, cultural resistance, and practical playbook behind the transformation—and what it means for the future of SaaS, small businesses, and human-centered AI. If you're leading (or bracing for) an AI shift, this one’s packed with hard-earned lessons and honest insight.<br></br><br></br><strong>Key Takeaways: </strong></p><ul><li><strong>You Can’t Wait for Buy-In—Leadership Means Pushing the Shift </strong>— John didn’t wait for excitement or alignment—he took back product leadership and <i>forced</i> the move toward AI. It wasn’t about consensus, it was about momentum. If you’re leading a team through this kind of shift, your job isn’t to ask for permission—it’s to create urgency before it's obvious.</li><li><strong>Speed Over Specs — Prototypes Are the New Strategy </strong>— Homebase moved from 20-page PRDs to live demos built in hours. That switch didn’t just make shipping faster—it changed the way teams learn, think, and listen to customers. The takeaway? Stop planning in the abstract. Ship something real, now.</li><li><strong>Culture Is the Real AI Roadblock </strong>— The hardest part of going AI-first isn’t tech—it’s trust, fear, and inertia. From engineers to support teams, John had to help people reach their “oh shit” moment with AI. That’s when change sticks. Until then, it’s just optional homework. Leaders need to make adoption <i>inevitable</i>.</li><li><strong>AI Should Bring You Closer to Your Customers, Not Farther </strong>— This episode isn’t about chasing shiny tools. It’s about using AI to reduce the noise—so your team can focus more on humans, not less. For John, pragmatic AI is about freeing up time, getting closer to customer problems, and making the org feel <i>smaller</i>, not colder.</li></ul><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwaldmann/">John Waldmann | LinkedIn</a><br></br>Homebase: <a href="https://www.joinhomebase.com/">All-in-one Employee Scheduling, Time Clocks, Payroll, & More | Homebase</a></p><p><strong>00:00</strong> Introduction and Initial Reactions to AI<br></br><strong>00:31</strong> Meet John Waldmann and the Story of Homebase<br></br><strong>00:53</strong> Reinventing Homebase as an AI-First Company<br></br><strong>01:46</strong> From PRDs to Prototypes: Building Faster, Learning Smarter<br></br><strong>05:02</strong> How AI Is Reshaping the Customer Experience<br></br><strong>09:19</strong> Culture Shock: Resistance, Skepticism, and AI Adoption<br></br><strong>14:03</strong> The End of SaaS as We Know It?<br></br><strong>19:34</strong> Leading Through Disruption: Ownership, Urgency, and Org Design<br></br><strong>25:12</strong> Forcing the Shift: Getting Teams to Embrace AI<br></br><strong>27:50</strong> Hiring the Unemployed—and Other Nontraditional Talent Bets<br></br><strong>28:56</strong> Curiosity > Credentials: What to Look for in AI-Ready Teams<br></br><strong>31:57</strong> New Expectations, OKRs, and Holding Teams Accountable<br></br><strong>37:10</strong> Serving Small Businesses Better with AI<br></br><strong>44:52</strong> Final Thoughts: Team Dynamics, Founder Risk, and What’s Next</p><p>📜 Read the transcript for this episode: <a href="https://podcast.beyondtheprompt.ai/episodes/rebuilding-from-inside-how-john-waldmann-led-an-ai-shift-without-breaking-his-team/transcript">Transcript of Rebuilding from Inside: How John Waldmann Led an AI Shift Without Breaking His Team |</a><br></br> </p>

Every month, it’s downloaded >300,000,000 times, making it one of the top 25 PyPi packages. OpenAI uses it in its SDK for structured outputs, it’s at the core of FastAPI, and if you’ve followed our AI Engineer Summit conference, Jason Liu of <a target="_blank" href="https://python.useinstructor.com/">Instructor</a> has given two great talks about it: <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yj-wSRJwrrc">“Pydantic is all you need”</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ4DIH2BVqg">“Pydantic is STILL all you need”</a>. </p><p>Now, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/samuel_colvin">Samuel Colvin</a> has raised $17M from Sequoia to turn Pydantic from an open source project to a full stack AI engineer platform with <a target="_blank" href="https://pydantic.dev/logfire">Logfire</a>, their observability platform, and <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/">PydanticAI</a>, their new agent framework.</p><p>Logfire: bringing OTEL to AI</p><p>OpenTelemetry recently merged <a target="_blank" href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-metrics/">Semantic Conventions for LLM workloads</a> which provides standard definitions to track performance like gen_ai.server.time_per_output_token. In Sam’s view at least 80% of new apps being built today have some sort of LLM usage in them, and just like web observability platform got replaced by cloud-first ones in the 2010s, Logfire wants to do the same for AI-first apps. </p><p>If you’re interested in the technical details, Logfire migrated away from Clickhouse to Datafusion for their backend. We spent some time on the importance of picking open source tools you understand and that you can actually contribute to upstream, rather than the more popular ones; listen in ~43:19 for that part.</p><p>Agents are the killer app for graphs</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic AI</a> is their attempt at taking a lot of the learnings that LangChain and the other early LLM frameworks had, and putting Python best practices into it. At an API level, it’s very similar to the other libraries: you can call LLMs, create agents, do function calling, do evals, etc.</p><p>They define an <strong>“Agent”</strong> as a container with a system prompt, tools, structured result, and an LLM. Under the hood, each Agent is now a <em>graph</em> of function calls that can orchestrate multi-step LLM interactions. You can start simple, then move toward fully dynamic graph-based control flow if needed.</p><p>“We were compelled enough by graphs once we got them right that our agent implementation [...] is now actually a graph under the hood.”</p><p><strong>Why Graphs?</strong></p><p>* More natural for complex or multi-step AI workflows.</p><p>* Easy to visualize and debug with mermaid diagrams.</p><p>* Potential for distributed runs, or “waiting days” between steps in certain flows.</p><p>In parallel, you see folks like Emil Eifrem of Neo4j <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI">talk about GraphRAG</a> as another place where graphs fit really well in the AI stack, so it might be time for more people to take them seriously.</p><p></p><p>Full Video Episode</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/7wwWRph3Jls">Like and subscribe</a>!</p><p></p><p>Chapters</p><p>* 00:00:00 Introductions</p><p>* 00:00:24 Origins of Pydantic</p><p>* 00:05:28 Pydantic's AI moment </p><p>* 00:08:05 Why build a new agents framework?</p><p>* 00:10:17 Overview of Pydantic AI</p><p>* 00:12:33 Becoming a believer in graphs</p><p>* 00:24:02 God Model vs Compound AI Systems</p><p>* 00:28:13 Why not build an LLM gateway?</p><p>* 00:31:39 Programmatic testing vs live evals</p><p>* 00:35:51 Using OpenTelemetry for AI traces</p><p>* 00:43:19 Why they don't use Clickhouse</p><p>* 00:48:34 Competing in the observability space</p><p>* 00:50:41 Licensing decisions for Pydantic and LogFire</p><p>* 00:51:48 Building Pydantic.run</p><p>* 00:55:24 Marimo and the future of Jupyter notebooks</p><p>* 00:57:44 London's AI scene</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samuelcolvin">Sam Colvin</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai">Pydantic AI</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://logfire.dev/">Logfire</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic.run">Pydantic.run</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod">Zod</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.e2b.dev/">E2B</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://arize.com/">Arize</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prefect.io/">Prefect</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language">GLA (Google Generative Language API)</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jxnlco">Jason Liu</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tiangolo">Sebastian Ramirez</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogomil-balkansky-5b3b3/">Bogomil Balkansky</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoodchatham/">Hood Chatham</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyphoward/">Jeremy Howard</a></p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="http://andrew.nerdnetworks.org/">Andrew Lamb</a></p><p>Transcript</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:00:03]: Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Latent Space podcast. This is Alessio, partner and CTO at <a target="_blank" href="https://decibel.vc/">Decibel Partners</a>, and I'm joined by my co-host Swyx, founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://smol.ai/">Smol AI</a>.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:00:12]: Good morning. And today we're very excited to have Sam Colvin join us from Pydantic AI. Welcome. Sam, I heard that Pydantic is all we need. Is that true?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:00:24]: I would say you might need Pydantic AI and Logfire as well, but it gets you a long way, that's for sure.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:00:29]: Pydantic almost basically needs no introduction. It's almost 300 million downloads in December. And obviously, in the previous podcasts and discussions we've had with Jason Liu, he's been a big fan and promoter of Pydantic and AI.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:00:45]: Yeah, it's weird because obviously I didn't create Pydantic originally for uses in AI, it predates LLMs. But it's like we've been lucky that it's been picked up by that community and used so widely.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:00:58]: Actually, maybe we'll hear it. Right from you, what is Pydantic and maybe a little bit of the origin story?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:01:04]: The best name for it, which is not quite right, is a validation library. And we get some tension around that name because it doesn't just do validation, it will do coercion by default. We now have strict mode, so you can disable that coercion. But by default, if you say you want an integer field and you get in a string of 1, 2, 3, it will convert it to 123 and a bunch of other sensible conversions. And as you can imagine, the semantics around it. Exactly when you convert and when you don't, it's complicated, but because of that, it's more than just validation. Back in 2017, when I first started it, the different thing it was doing was using type hints to define your schema. That was controversial at the time. It was genuinely disapproved of by some people. I think the success of Pydantic and libraries like FastAPI that build on top of it means that today that's no longer controversial in Python. And indeed, lots of other people have copied that route, but yeah, it's a data validation library. It uses type hints for the for the most part and obviously does all the other stuff you want, like serialization on top of that. But yeah, that's the core.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:02:06]: Do you have any fun stories on how JSON schemas ended up being kind of like the structure output standard for LLMs? And were you involved in any of these discussions? Because I know OpenAI was, you know, one of the early adopters. So did they reach out to you? Was there kind of like a structure output console in open source that people were talking about or was it just a random?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:02:26]: No, very much not. So I originally. Didn't implement JSON schema inside Pydantic and then Sebastian, Sebastian Ramirez, FastAPI came along and like the first I ever heard of him was over a weekend. I got like 50 emails from him or 50 like emails as he was committing to Pydantic, adding JSON schema long pre version one. So the reason it was added was for OpenAPI, which is obviously closely akin to JSON schema. And then, yeah, I don't know why it was JSON that got picked up and used by OpenAI. It was obviously very convenient for us. That's because it meant that not only can you do the validation, but because Pydantic will generate you the JSON schema, it will it kind of can be one source of source of truth for structured outputs and tools.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:03:09]: Before we dive in further on the on the AI side of things, something I'm mildly curious about, obviously, there's Zod in JavaScript land. Every now and then there is a new sort of in vogue validation library that that takes over for quite a few years and then maybe like some something else comes along. Is Pydantic? Is it done like the core Pydantic?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:03:30]: I've just come off a call where we were redesigning some of the internal bits. There will be a v3 at some point, which will not break people's code half as much as v2 as in v2 was the was the massive rewrite into Rust, but also fixing all the stuff that was broken back from like version zero point something that we didn't fix in v1 because it was a side project. We have plans to move some of the basically store the data in Rust types after validation. Not completely. So we're still working to design the Pythonic version of it, in order for it to be able to convert into Python types. So then if you were doing like validation and then serialization, you would never have to go via a Python type we reckon that can give us somewhere between three and five times another three to five times speed up. That's probably the biggest thing. Also, like changing how easy it is to basically extend Pydantic and define how particular types, like for example, NumPy arrays are validated and serialized. But there's also stuff going on. And for example, Jitter, the JSON library in Rust that does the JSON parsing, has SIMD implementation at the moment only for AMD64. So we can add that. We need to go and add SIMD for other instruction sets. So there's a bunch more we can do on performance. I don't think we're going to go and revolutionize Pydantic, but it's going to continue to get faster, continue, hopefully, to allow people to do more advanced things. We might add a binary format like CBOR for serialization for when you'll just want to put the data into a database and probably load it again from Pydantic. So there are some things that will come along, but for the most part, it should just get faster and cleaner.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:05:04]: From a focus perspective, I guess, as a founder too, how did you think about the AI interest rising? And then how do you kind of prioritize, okay, this is worth going into more, and we'll talk about Pydantic AI and all of that. What was maybe your early experience with LLAMP, and when did you figure out, okay, this is something we should take seriously and focus more resources on it?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:05:28]: I'll answer that, but I'll answer what I think is a kind of parallel question, which is Pydantic's weird, because Pydantic existed, obviously, before I was starting a company. I was working on it in my spare time, and then beginning of 22, I started working on the rewrite in Rust. And I worked on it full-time for a year and a half, and then once we started the company, people came and joined. And it was a weird project, because that would never go away. You can't get signed off inside a startup. Like, we're going to go off and three engineers are going to work full-on for a year in Python and Rust, writing like 30,000 lines of Rust just to release open-source-free Python library. The result of that has been excellent for us as a company, right? As in, it's made us remain entirely relevant. And it's like, Pydantic is not just used in the SDKs of all of the AI libraries, but I can't say which one, but one of the big foundational model companies, when they upgraded from Pydantic v1 to v2, their number one internal model... The metric of performance is time to first token. That went down by 20%. So you think about all of the actual AI going on inside, and yet at least 20% of the CPU, or at least the latency inside requests was actually Pydantic, which shows like how widely it's used. So we've benefited from doing that work, although it didn't, it would have never have made financial sense in most companies. In answer to your question about like, how do we prioritize AI, I mean, the honest truth is we've spent a lot of the last year and a half building. Good general purpose observability inside LogFire and making Pydantic good for general purpose use cases. And the AI has kind of come to us. Like we just, not that we want to get away from it, but like the appetite, uh, both in Pydantic and in LogFire to go and build with AI is enormous because it kind of makes sense, right? Like if you're starting a new greenfield project in Python today, what's the chance that you're using GenAI 80%, let's say, globally, obviously it's like a hundred percent in California, but even worldwide, it's probably 80%. Yeah. And so everyone needs that stuff. And there's so much yet to be figured out so much like space to do things better in the ecosystem in a way that like to go and implement a database that's better than Postgres is a like Sisyphean task. Whereas building, uh, tools that are better for GenAI than some of the stuff that's about now is not very difficult. Putting the actual models themselves to one side.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:07:40]: And then at the same time, then you released Pydantic AI recently, which is, uh, um, you know, agent framework and early on, I would say everybody like, you know, Langchain and like, uh, Pydantic kind of like a first class support, a lot of these frameworks, we're trying to use you to be better. What was the decision behind we should do our own framework? Were there any design decisions that you disagree with any workloads that you think people didn't support? Well,</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:08:05]: it wasn't so much like design and workflow, although I think there were some, some things we've done differently. Yeah. I think looking in general at the ecosystem of agent frameworks, the engineering quality is far below that of the rest of the Python ecosystem. There's a bunch of stuff that we have learned how to do over the last 20 years of building Python libraries and writing Python code that seems to be abandoned by people when they build agent frameworks. Now I can kind of respect that, particularly in the very first agent frameworks, like Langchain, where they were literally figuring out how to go and do this stuff. It's completely understandable that you would like basically skip some stuff.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:08:42]: I'm shocked by the like quality of some of the agent frameworks that have come out recently from like well-respected names, which it just seems to be opportunism and I have little time for that, but like the early ones, like I think they were just figuring out how to do stuff and just as lots of people have learned from Pydantic, we were able to learn a bit from them. I think from like the gap we saw and the thing we were frustrated by was the production readiness. And that means things like type checking, even if type checking makes it hard. Like Pydantic AI, I will put my hand up now and say it has a lot of generics and you need to, it's probably easier to use it if you've written a bit of Rust and you really understand generics, but like, and that is, we're not claiming that that makes it the easiest thing to use in all cases, we think it makes it good for production applications in big systems where type checking is a no-brainer in Python. But there are also a bunch of stuff we've learned from maintaining Pydantic over the years that we've gone and done. So every single example in Pydantic AI's documentation is run on Python. As part of tests and every single print output within an example is checked during tests. So it will always be up to date. And then a bunch of things that, like I say, are standard best practice within the rest of the Python ecosystem, but I'm not followed surprisingly by some AI libraries like coverage, linting, type checking, et cetera, et cetera, where I think these are no-brainers, but like weirdly they're not followed by some of the other libraries.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:10:04]: And can you just give an overview of the framework itself? I think there's kind of like the. LLM calling frameworks, there are the multi-agent frameworks, there's the workflow frameworks, like what does Pydantic AI do?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:10:17]: I glaze over a bit when I hear all of the different sorts of frameworks, but I like, and I will tell you when I built Pydantic, when I built Logfire and when I built Pydantic AI, my methodology is not to go and like research and review all of the other things. I kind of work out what I want and I go and build it and then feedback comes and we adjust. So the fundamental building block of Pydantic AI is agents. The exact definition of agents and how you want to define them. is obviously ambiguous and our things are probably sort of agent-lit, not that we would want to go and rename them to agent-lit, but like the point is you probably build them together to build something and most people will call an agent. So an agent in our case has, you know, things like a prompt, like system prompt and some tools and a structured return type if you want it, that covers the vast majority of cases. There are situations where you want to go further and the most complex workflows where you want graphs and I resisted graphs for quite a while. I was sort of of the opinion you didn't need them and you could use standard like Python flow control to do all of that stuff. I had a few arguments with people, but I basically came around to, yeah, I can totally see why graphs are useful. But then we have the problem that by default, they're not type safe because if you have a like add edge method where you give the names of two different edges, there's no type checking, right? Even if you go and do some, I'm not, not all the graph libraries are AI specific. So there's a, there's a graph library called, but it allows, it does like a basic runtime type checking. Ironically using Pydantic to try and make up for the fact that like fundamentally that graphs are not typed type safe. Well, I like Pydantic, but it did, that's not a real solution to have to go and run the code to see if it's safe. There's a reason that starting type checking is so powerful. And so we kind of, from a lot of iteration eventually came up with a system of using normally data classes to define nodes where you return the next node you want to call and where we're able to go and introspect the return type of a node to basically build the graph. And so the graph is. Yeah. Inherently type safe. And once we got that right, I, I wasn't, I'm incredibly excited about graphs. I think there's like masses of use cases for them, both in gen AI and other development, but also software's all going to have interact with gen AI, right? It's going to be like web. There's no longer be like a web department in a company is that there's just like all the developers are building for web building with databases. The same is going to be true for gen AI.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:12:33]: Yeah. I see on your docs, you call an agent, a container that contains a system prompt function. Tools, structure, result, dependency type model, and then model settings. Are the graphs in your mind, different agents? Are they different prompts for the same agent? What are like the structures in your mind?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:12:52]: So we were compelled enough by graphs once we got them right, that we actually merged the PR this morning. That means our agent implementation without changing its API at all is now actually a graph under the hood as it is built using our graph library. So graphs are basically a lower level tool that allow you to build these complex workflows. Our agents are technically one of the many graphs you could go and build. And we just happened to build that one for you because it's a very common, commonplace one. But obviously there are cases where you need more complex workflows where the current agent assumptions don't work. And that's where you can then go and use graphs to build more complex things.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:13:29]: You said you were cynical about graphs. What changed your mind specifically?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:13:33]: I guess people kept giving me examples of things that they wanted to use graphs for. And my like, yeah, but you could do that in standard flow control in Python became a like less and less compelling argument to me because I've maintained those systems that end up with like spaghetti code. And I could see the appeal of this like structured way of defining the workflow of my code. And it's really neat that like just from your code, just from your type hints, you can get out a mermaid diagram that defines exactly what can go and happen.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:14:00]: Right. Yeah. You do have very neat implementation of sort of inferring the graph from type hints, I guess. Yeah. Is what I would call it. Yeah. I think the question always is I have gone back and forth. I used to work at Temporal where we would actually spend a lot of time complaining about graph based workflow solutions like AWS step functions. And we would actually say that we were better because you could use normal control flow that you already knew and worked with. Yours, I guess, is like a little bit of a nice compromise. Like it looks like normal Pythonic code. But you just have to keep in mind what the type hints actually mean. And that's what we do with the quote unquote magic that the graph construction does.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:14:42]: Yeah, exactly. And if you look at the internal logic of actually running a graph, it's incredibly simple. It's basically call a node, get a node back, call that node, get a node back, call that node. If you get an end, you're done. We will add in soon support for, well, basically storage so that you can store the state between each node that's run. And then the idea is you can then distribute the graph and run it across computers. And also, I mean, the other weird, the other bit that's really valuable is across time. Because it's all very well if you look at like lots of the graph examples that like Claude will give you. If it gives you an example, it gives you this lovely enormous mermaid chart of like the workflow, for example, managing returns if you're an e-commerce company. But what you realize is some of those lines are literally one function calls another function. And some of those lines are wait six days for the customer to print their like piece of paper and put it in the post. And if you're writing like your demo. Project or your like proof of concept, that's fine because you can just say, and now we call this function. But when you're building when you're in real in real life, that doesn't work. And now how do we manage that concept to basically be able to start somewhere else in the in our code? Well, this graph implementation makes it incredibly easy because you just pass the node that is the start point for carrying on the graph and it continues to run. So it's things like that where I was like, yeah, I can just imagine how things I've done in the past would be fundamentally easier to understand if we had done them with graphs.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:16:07]: You say imagine, but like right now, this pedantic AI actually resume, you know, six days later, like you said, or is this just like a theoretical thing we can go someday?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:16:16]: I think it's basically Q&A. So there's an AI that's asking the user a question and effectively you then call the CLI again to continue the conversation. And it basically instantiates the node and calls the graph with that node again. Now, we don't have the logic yet for effectively storing state in the database between individual nodes that we're going to add soon. But like the rest of it is basically there.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:16:37]: It does make me think that not only are you competing with Langchain now and obviously Instructor, and now you're going into sort of the more like orchestrated things like Airflow, Prefect, Daxter, those guys.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:16:52]: Yeah, I mean, we're good friends with the Prefect guys and Temporal have the same investors as us. And I'm sure that my investor Bogomol would not be too happy if I was like, oh, yeah, by the way, as well as trying to take on Datadog. We're also going off and trying to take on Temporal and everyone else doing that. Obviously, we're not doing all of the infrastructure of deploying that right yet, at least. We're, you know, we're just building a Python library. And like what's crazy about our graph implementation is, sure, there's a bit of magic in like introspecting the return type, you know, extracting things from unions, stuff like that. But like the actual calls, as I say, is literally call a function and get back a thing and call that. It's like incredibly simple and therefore easy to maintain. The question is, how useful is it? Well, I don't know yet. I think we have to go and find out. We have a whole. We've had a slew of people joining our Slack over the last few days and saying, tell me how good Pydantic AI is. How good is Pydantic AI versus Langchain? And I refuse to answer. That's your job to go and find that out. Not mine. We built a thing. I'm compelled by it, but I'm obviously biased. The ecosystem will work out what the useful tools are.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:17:52]: Bogomol was my board member when I was at Temporal. And I think I think just generally also having been a workflow engine investor and participant in this space, it's a big space. Like everyone needs different functions. I think the one thing that I would say like yours, you know, as a library, you don't have that much control of it over the infrastructure. I do like the idea that each new agents or whatever or unit of work, whatever you call that should spin up in this sort of isolated boundaries. Whereas yours, I think around everything runs in the same process. But you ideally want to sort of spin out its own little container of things.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:18:30]: I agree with you a hundred percent. And we will. It would work now. Right. As in theory, you're just like as long as you can serialize the calls to the next node, you just have to all of the different containers basically have to have the same the same code. I mean, I'm super excited about Cloudflare workers running Python and being able to install dependencies. And if Cloudflare could only give me my invitation to the private beta of that, we would be exploring that right now because I'm super excited about that as a like compute level for some of this stuff where exactly what you're saying, basically. You can run everything as an individual. Like worker function and distribute it. And it's resilient to failure, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:19:08]: And it spins up like a thousand instances simultaneously. You know, you want it to be sort of truly serverless at once. Actually, I know we have some Cloudflare friends who are listening, so hopefully they'll get in front of the line. Especially.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:19:19]: I was in Cloudflare's office last week shouting at them about other things that frustrate me. I have a love-hate relationship with Cloudflare. Their tech is awesome. But because I use it the whole time, I then get frustrated. So, yeah, I'm sure I will. I will. I will get there soon.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:19:32]: There's a side tangent on Cloudflare. Is Python supported at full? I actually wasn't fully aware of what the status of that thing is.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:19:39]: Yeah. So Pyodide, which is Python running inside the browser in scripting, is supported now by Cloudflare. They basically, they're having some struggles working out how to manage, ironically, dependencies that have binaries, in particular, Pydantic. Because these workers where you can have thousands of them on a given metal machine, you don't want to have a difference. You basically want to be able to have a share. Shared memory for all the different Pydantic installations, effectively. That's the thing they work out. They're working out. But Hood, who's my friend, who is the primary maintainer of Pyodide, works for Cloudflare. And that's basically what he's doing, is working out how to get Python running on Cloudflare's network.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:20:19]: I mean, the nice thing is that your binary is really written in Rust, right? Yeah. Which also compiles the WebAssembly. Yeah. So maybe there's a way that you'd build... You have just a different build of Pydantic and that ships with whatever your distro for Cloudflare workers is.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:20:36]: Yes, that's exactly what... So Pyodide has builds for Pydantic Core and for things like NumPy and basically all of the popular binary libraries. Yeah. It's just basic. And you're doing exactly that, right? You're using Rust to compile the WebAssembly and then you're calling that shared library from Python. And it's unbelievably complicated, but it works. Okay.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:20:57]: Staying on graphs a little bit more, and then I wanted to go to some of the other features that you have in Pydantic AI. I see in your docs, there are sort of four levels of agents. There's single agents, there's agent delegation, programmatic agent handoff. That seems to be what OpenAI swarms would be like. And then the last one, graph-based control flow. Would you say that those are sort of the mental hierarchy of how these things go?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:21:21]: Yeah, roughly. Okay.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:21:22]: You had some expression around OpenAI swarms. Well.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:21:25]: And indeed, OpenAI have got in touch with me and basically, maybe I'm not supposed to say this, but basically said that Pydantic AI looks like what swarms would become if it was production ready. So, yeah. I mean, like, yeah, which makes sense. Awesome. Yeah. I mean, in fact, it was specifically saying, how can we give people the same feeling that they were getting from swarms that led us to go and implement graphs? Because my, like, just call the next agent with Python code was not a satisfactory answer to people. So it was like, okay, we've got to go and have a better answer for that. It's not like, let us to get to graphs. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:21:56]: I mean, it's a minimal viable graph in some sense. What are the shapes of graphs that people should know? So the way that I would phrase this is I think Anthropic did a very good public service and also kind of surprisingly influential blog post, I would say, when they wrote Building Effective Agents. We actually have the authors coming to speak at my conference in New York, which I think you're giving a workshop at. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:22:24]: I'm trying to work it out. But yes, I think so.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:22:26]: Tell me if you're not. yeah, I mean, like, that was the first, I think, authoritative view of, like, what kinds of graphs exist in agents and let's give each of them a name so that everyone is on the same page. So I'm just kind of curious if you have community names or top five patterns of graphs.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:22:44]: I don't have top five patterns of graphs. I would love to see what people are building with them. But like, it's been it's only been a couple of weeks. And of course, there's a point is that. Because they're relatively unopinionated about what you can go and do with them. They don't suit them. Like, you can go and do lots of lots of things with them, but they don't have the structure to go and have like specific names as much as perhaps like some other systems do. I think what our agents are, which have a name and I can't remember what it is, but this basically system of like, decide what tool to call, go back to the center, decide what tool to call, go back to the center and then exit. One form of graph, which, as I say, like our agents are effectively one implementation of a graph, which is why under the hood they are now using graphs. And it'll be interesting to see over the next few years whether we end up with these like predefined graph names or graph structures or whether it's just like, yep, I built a graph or whether graphs just turn out not to match people's mental image of what they want and die away. We'll see.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:23:38]: I think there is always appeal. Every developer eventually gets graph religion and goes, oh, yeah, everything's a graph. And then they probably over rotate and go go too far into graphs. And then they have to learn a whole bunch of DSLs. And then they're like, actually, I didn't need that. I need this. And they scale back a little bit.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:23:55]: I'm at the beginning of that process. I'm currently a graph maximalist, although I haven't actually put any into production yet. But yeah.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:24:02]: This has a lot of philosophical connections with other work coming out of UC Berkeley on compounding AI systems. I don't know if you know of or care. This is the Gartner world of things where they need some kind of industry terminology to sell it to enterprises. I don't know if you know about any of that.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:24:24]: I haven't. I probably should. I should probably do it because I should probably get better at selling to enterprises. But no, no, I don't. Not right now.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:24:29]: This is really the argument is that instead of putting everything in one model, you have more control and more maybe observability to if you break everything out into composing little models and changing them together. And obviously, then you need an orchestration framework to do that. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:24:47]: And it makes complete sense. And one of the things we've seen with agents is they work well when they work well. But when they. Even if you have the observability through log five that you can see what was going on, if you don't have a nice hook point to say, hang on, this is all gone wrong. You have a relatively blunt instrument of basically erroring when you exceed some kind of limit. But like what you need to be able to do is effectively iterate through these runs so that you can have your own control flow where you're like, OK, we've gone too far. And that's where one of the neat things about our graph implementation is you can basically call next in a loop rather than just running the full graph. And therefore, you have this opportunity to to break out of it. But yeah, basically, it's the same point, which is like if you have two bigger unit of work to some extent, whether or not it involves gen AI. But obviously, it's particularly problematic in gen AI. You only find out afterwards when you've spent quite a lot of time and or money when it's gone off and done done the wrong thing.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:25:39]: Oh, drop on this. We're not going to resolve this here, but I'll drop this and then we can move on to the next thing. This is the common way that we we developers talk about this. And then the machine learning researchers look at us. And laugh and say, that's cute. And then they just train a bigger model and they wipe us out in the next training run. So I think there's a certain amount of we are fighting the bitter lesson here. We're fighting AGI. And, you know, when AGI arrives, this will all go away. Obviously, on Latent Space, we don't really discuss that because I think AGI is kind of this hand wavy concept that isn't super relevant. But I think we have to respect that. For example, you could do a chain of thoughts with graphs and you could manually orchestrate a nice little graph that does like. Reflect, think about if you need more, more inference time, compute, you know, that's the hot term now. And then think again and, you know, scale that up. Or you could train Strawberry and DeepSeq R1. Right.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:26:32]: I saw someone saying recently, oh, they were really optimistic about agents because models are getting faster exponentially. And I like took a certain amount of self-control not to describe that it wasn't exponential. But my main point was. If models are getting faster as quickly as you say they are, then we don't need agents and we don't really need any of these abstraction layers. We can just give our model and, you know, access to the Internet, cross our fingers and hope for the best. Agents, agent frameworks, graphs, all of this stuff is basically making up for the fact that right now the models are not that clever. In the same way that if you're running a customer service business and you have loads of people sitting answering telephones, the less well trained they are, the less that you trust them, the more that you need to give them a script to go through. Whereas, you know, so if you're running a bank and you have lots of customer service people who you don't trust that much, then you tell them exactly what to say. If you're doing high net worth banking, you just employ people who you think are going to be charming to other rich people and set them off to go and have coffee with people. Right. And the same is true of models. The more intelligent they are, the less we need to tell them, like structure what they go and do and constrain the routes in which they take.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:27:42]: Yeah. Yeah. Agree with that. So I'm happy to move on. So the other parts of Pydantic AI that are worth commenting on, and this is like my last rant, I promise. So obviously, every framework needs to do its sort of model adapter layer, which is, oh, you can easily swap from OpenAI to Cloud to Grok. You also have, which I didn't know about, Google GLA, which I didn't really know about until I saw this in your docs, which is generative language API. I assume that's AI Studio? Yes.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:28:13]: Google don't have good names for it. So Vertex is very clear. That seems to be the API that like some of the things use, although it returns 503 about 20% of the time. So... Vertex? No. Vertex, fine. But the... Oh, oh. GLA. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:28:28]: I agree with that.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:28:29]: So we have, again, another example of like, well, I think we go the extra mile in terms of engineering is we run on every commit, at least commit to main, we run tests against the live models. Not lots of tests, but like a handful of them. Oh, okay. And we had a point last week where, yeah, GLA is a little bit better. GLA1 was failing every single run. One of their tests would fail. And we, I think we might even have commented out that one at the moment. So like all of the models fail more often than you might expect, but like that one seems to be particularly likely to fail. But Vertex is the same API, but much more reliable.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:29:01]: My rant here is that, you know, versions of this appear in Langchain and every single framework has to have its own little thing, a version of that. I would put to you, and then, you know, this is, this can be agree to disagree. This is not needed in Pydantic AI. I would much rather you adopt a layer like Lite LLM or what's the other one in JavaScript port key. And that's their job. They focus on that one thing and they, they normalize APIs for you. All new models are automatically added and you don't have to duplicate this inside of your framework. So for example, if I wanted to use deep seek, I'm out of luck because Pydantic AI doesn't have deep seek yet.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:29:38]: Yeah, it does.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:29:39]: Oh, it does. Okay. I'm sorry. But you know what I mean? Should this live in your code or should it live in a layer that's kind of your API gateway that's a defined piece of infrastructure that people have?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:29:49]: And I think if a company who are well known, who are respected by everyone had come along and done this at the right time, maybe we should have done it a year and a half ago and said, we're going to be the universal AI layer. That would have been a credible thing to do. I've heard varying reports of Lite LLM is the truth. And it didn't seem to have exactly the type safety that we needed. Also, as I understand it, and again, I haven't looked into it in great detail. Part of their business model is proxying the request through their, through their own system to do the generalization. That would be an enormous put off to an awful lot of people. Honestly, the truth is I don't think it is that much work unifying the model. I get where you're coming from. I kind of see your point. I think the truth is that everyone is centralizing around open AIs. Open AI's API is the one to do. So DeepSeq support that. Grok with OK support that. Ollama also does it. I mean, if there is that library right now, it's more or less the open AI SDK. And it's very high quality. It's well type checked. It uses Pydantic. So I'm biased. But I mean, I think it's pretty well respected anyway.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:30:57]: There's different ways to do this. Because also, it's not just about normalizing the APIs. You have to do secret management and all that stuff.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:31:05]: Yeah. And there's also. There's Vertex and Bedrock, which to one extent or another, effectively, they host multiple models, but they don't unify the API. But they do unify the auth, as I understand it. Although we're halfway through doing Bedrock. So I don't know about it that well. But they're kind of weird hybrids because they support multiple models. But like I say, the auth is centralized.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:31:28]: Yeah, I'm surprised they don't unify the API. That seems like something that I would do. You know, we can discuss all this all day. There's a lot of APIs. I agree.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:31:36]: It would be nice if there was a universal one that we didn't have to go and build.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:31:39]: And I guess the other side of, you know, routing model and picking models like evals. How do you actually figure out which one you should be using? I know you have one. First of all, you have very good support for mocking in unit tests, which is something that a lot of other frameworks don't do. So, you know, my favorite Ruby library is VCR because it just, you know, it just lets me store the HTTP requests and replay them. That part I'll kind of skip. I think you are busy like this test model. We're like just through Python. You try and figure out what the model might respond without actually calling the model. And then you have the function model where people can kind of customize outputs. Any other fun stories maybe from there? Or is it just what you see is what you get, so to speak?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:32:18]: On those two, I think what you see is what you get. On the evals, I think watch this space. I think it's something that like, again, I was somewhat cynical about for some time. Still have my cynicism about some of the well, it's unfortunate that so many different things are called evals. It would be nice if we could agree. What they are and what they're not. But look, I think it's a really important space. I think it's something that we're going to be working on soon, both in Pydantic AI and in LogFire to try and support better because it's like it's an unsolved problem.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:32:45]: Yeah, you do say in your doc that anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your eval should be defined can safely be ignored.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:32:52]: We'll delete that sentence when we tell people how to do their evals.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:32:56]: Exactly. I was like, we need we need a snapshot of this today. And so let's talk about eval. So there's kind of like the vibe. Yeah. So you have evals, which is what you do when you're building. Right. Because you cannot really like test it that many times to get statistical significance. And then there's the production eval. So you also have LogFire, which is kind of like your observability product, which I tried before. It's very nice. What are some of the learnings you've had from building an observability tool for LEMPs? And yeah, as people think about evals, even like what are the right things to measure? What are like the right number of samples that you need to actually start making decisions?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:33:33]: I'm not the best person to answer that is the truth. So I'm not going to come in here and tell you that I think I know the answer on the exact number. I mean, we can do some back of the envelope statistics calculations to work out that like having 30 probably gets you most of the statistical value of having 200 for, you know, by definition, 15% of the work. But the exact like how many examples do you need? For example, that's a much harder question to answer because it's, you know, it's deep within the how models operate in terms of LogFire. One of the reasons we built LogFire the way we have and we allow you to write SQL directly against your data and we're trying to build the like powerful fundamentals of observability is precisely because we know we don't know the answers. And so allowing people to go and innovate on how they're going to consume that stuff and how they're going to process it is we think that's valuable. Because even if we come along and offer you an evals framework on top of LogFire, it won't be right in all regards. And we want people to be able to go and innovate and being able to write their own SQL connected to the API. And effectively query the data like it's a database with SQL allows people to innovate on that stuff. And that's what allows us to do it as well. I mean, we do a bunch of like testing what's possible by basically writing SQL directly against LogFire as any user could. I think the other the other really interesting bit that's going on in observability is OpenTelemetry is centralizing around semantic attributes for GenAI. So it's a relatively new project. A lot of it's still being added at the moment. But basically the idea that like. They unify how both SDKs and or agent frameworks send observability data to to any OpenTelemetry endpoint. And so, again, we can go and having that unification allows us to go and like basically compare different libraries, compare different models much better. That stuff's in a very like early stage of development. One of the things we're going to be working on pretty soon is basically, I suspect, GenAI will be the first agent framework that implements those semantic attributes properly. Because, again, we control and we can say this is important for observability, whereas most of the other agent frameworks are not maintained by people who are trying to do observability. With the exception of Langchain, where they have the observability platform, but they chose not to go down the OpenTelemetry route. So they're like plowing their own furrow. And, you know, they're a lot they're even further away from standardization.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:35:51]: Can you maybe just give a quick overview of how OTEL ties into the AI workflows? There's kind of like the question of is, you know, a trace. And a span like a LLM call. Is it the agent? It's kind of like the broader thing you're tracking. How should people think about it?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:36:06]: Yeah, so they have a PR that I think may have now been merged from someone at IBM talking about remote agents and trying to support this concept of remote agents within GenAI. I'm not particularly compelled by that because I don't think that like that's actually by any means the common use case. But like, I suppose it's fine for it to be there. The majority of the stuff in OTEL is basically defining how you would instrument. A given call to an LLM. So basically the actual LLM call, what data you would send to your telemetry provider, how you would structure that. Apart from this slightly odd stuff on remote agents, most of the like agent level consideration is not yet implemented in is not yet decided effectively. And so there's a bit of ambiguity. Obviously, what's good about OTEL is you can in the end send whatever attributes you like. But yeah, there's quite a lot of churn in that space and exactly how we store the data. I think that one of the most interesting things, though, is that if you think about observability. Traditionally, it was sure everyone would say our observability data is very important. We must keep it safe. But actually, companies work very hard to basically not have anything that sensitive in their observability data. So if you're a doctor in a hospital and you search for a drug for an STI, the sequel might be sent to the observability provider. But none of the parameters would. It wouldn't have the patient number or their name or the drug. With GenAI, that distinction doesn't exist because it's all just messed up in the text. If you have that same patient asking an LLM how to. What drug they should take or how to stop smoking. You can't extract the PII and not send it to the observability platform. So the sensitivity of the data that's going to end up in observability platforms is going to be like basically different order of magnitude to what's in what you would normally send to Datadog. Of course, you can make a mistake and send someone's password or their card number to Datadog. But that would be seen as a as a like mistake. Whereas in GenAI, a lot of data is going to be sent. And I think that's why companies like Langsmith and are trying hard to offer observability. On prem, because there's a bunch of companies who are happy for Datadog to be cloud hosted, but want self-hosted self-hosting for this observability stuff with GenAI.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:38:09]: And are you doing any of that today? Because I know in each of the spans you have like the number of tokens, you have the context, you're just storing everything. And then you're going to offer kind of like a self-hosting for the platform, basically. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:38:23]: So we have scrubbing roughly equivalent to what the other observability platforms have. So if we, you know, if we see password as the key, we won't send the value. But like, like I said, that doesn't really work in GenAI. So we're accepting we're going to have to store a lot of data and then we'll offer self-hosting for those people who can afford it and who need it.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:38:42]: And then this is, I think, the first time that most of the workloads performance is depending on a third party. You know, like if you're looking at Datadog data, usually it's your app that is driving the latency and like the memory usage and all of that. Here you're going to have spans that maybe take a long time to perform because the GLA API is not working or because OpenAI is kind of like overwhelmed. Do you do anything there since like the provider is almost like the same across customers? You know, like, are you trying to surface these things for people and say, hey, this was like a very slow span, but actually all customers using OpenAI right now are seeing the same thing. So maybe don't worry about it or.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:39:20]: Not yet. We do a few things that people don't generally do in OTA. So we send. We send information at the beginning. At the beginning of a trace as well as sorry, at the beginning of a span, as well as when it finishes. By default, OTA only sends you data when the span finishes. So if you think about a request which might take like 20 seconds, even if some of the intermediate spans finished earlier, you can't basically place them on the page until you get the top level span. And so if you're using standard OTA, you can't show anything until those requests are finished. When those requests are taking a few hundred milliseconds, it doesn't really matter. But when you're doing Gen AI calls or when you're like running a batch job that might take 30 minutes. That like latency of not being able to see the span is like crippling to understanding your application. And so we've we do a bunch of slightly complex stuff to basically send data about a span as it starts, which is closely related. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:40:09]: Any thoughts on all the other people trying to build on top of OpenTelemetry in different languages, too? There's like the OpenLEmetry project, which doesn't really roll off the tongue. But how do you see the future of these kind of tools? Is everybody going to have to build? Why does everybody want to build? They want to build their own open source observability thing to then sell?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:40:29]: I mean, we are not going off and trying to instrument the likes of the OpenAI SDK with the new semantic attributes, because at some point that's going to happen and it's going to live inside OTEL and we might help with it. But we're a tiny team. We don't have time to go and do all of that work. So OpenLEmetry, like interesting project. But I suspect eventually most of those semantic like that instrumentation of the big of the SDKs will live, like I say, inside the main OpenTelemetry report. I suppose. What happens to the agent frameworks? What data you basically need at the framework level to get the context is kind of unclear. I don't think we know the answer yet. But I mean, I was on the, I guess this is kind of semi-public, because I was on the call with the OpenTelemetry call last week talking about GenAI. And there was someone from Arize talking about the challenges they have trying to get OpenTelemetry data out of Langchain, where it's not like natively implemented. And obviously they're having quite a tough time. And I was realizing, hadn't really realized this before, but how lucky we are to primarily be talking about our own agent framework, where we have the control rather than trying to go and instrument other people's.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:41:36]: Sorry, I actually didn't know about this semantic conventions thing. It looks like, yeah, it's merged into main OTel. What should people know about this? I had never heard of it before.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:41:45]: Yeah, I think it looks like a great start. I think there's some unknowns around how you send the messages that go back and forth, which is kind of the most important part. It's the most important thing of all. And that is moved out of attributes and into OTel events. OTel events in turn are moving from being on a span to being their own top-level API where you send data. So there's a bunch of churn still going on. I'm impressed by how fast the OTel community is moving on this project. I guess they, like everyone else, get that this is important, and it's something that people are crying out to get instrumentation off. So I'm kind of pleasantly surprised at how fast they're moving, but it makes sense.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:42:25]: I'm just kind of browsing through the specification. I can already see that this basically bakes in whatever the previous paradigm was. So now they have genai.usage.prompt tokens and genai.usage.completion tokens. And obviously now we have reasoning tokens as well. And then only one form of sampling, which is top-p. You're basically baking in or sort of reifying things that you think are important today, but it's not a super foolproof way of doing this for the future. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:42:54]: I mean, that's what's neat about OTel is you can always go and send another attribute and that's fine. It's just there are a bunch that are agreed on. But I would say, you know, to come back to your previous point about whether or not we should be relying on one centralized abstraction layer, this stuff is moving so fast that if you start relying on someone else's standard, you risk basically falling behind because you're relying on someone else to keep things up to date.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:43:14]: Or you fall behind because you've got other things going on.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:43:17]: Yeah, yeah. That's fair. That's fair.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:43:19]: Any other observations just about building LogFire, actually? Let's just talk about this. So you announced LogFire. I was kind of only familiar with LogFire because of your Series A announcement. I actually thought you were making a separate company. I remember some amount of confusion with you when that came out. So to be clear, it's Pydantic LogFire and the company is one company that has kind of two products, an open source thing and an observability thing, correct? Yeah. I was just kind of curious, like any learnings building LogFire? So classic question is, do you use ClickHouse? Is this like the standard persistence layer? Any learnings doing that?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:43:54]: We don't use ClickHouse. We started building our database with ClickHouse, moved off ClickHouse onto Timescale, which is a Postgres extension to do analytical databases. Wow. And then moved off Timescale onto DataFusion. And we're basically now building, it's DataFusion, but it's kind of our own database. Bogomil is not entirely happy that we went through three databases before we chose one. I'll say that. But like, we've got to the right one in the end. I think we could have realized that Timescale wasn't right. I think ClickHouse. They both taught us a lot and we're in a great place now. But like, yeah, it's been a real journey on the database in particular.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:44:28]: Okay. So, you know, as a database nerd, I have to like double click on this, right? So ClickHouse is supposed to be the ideal backend for anything like this. And then moving from ClickHouse to Timescale is another counterintuitive move that I didn't expect because, you know, Timescale is like an extension on top of Postgres. Not super meant for like high volume logging. But like, yeah, tell us those decisions.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:44:50]: So at the time, ClickHouse did not have good support for JSON. I was speaking to someone yesterday and said ClickHouse doesn't have good support for JSON and got roundly stepped on because apparently it does now. So they've obviously gone and built their proper JSON support. But like back when we were trying to use it, I guess a year ago or a bit more than a year ago, everything happened to be a map and maps are a pain to try and do like looking up JSON type data. And obviously all these attributes, everything you're talking about there in terms of the GenAI stuff. You can choose to make them top level columns if you want. But the simplest thing is just to put them all into a big JSON pile. And that was a problem with ClickHouse. Also, ClickHouse had some really ugly edge cases like by default, or at least until I complained about it a lot, ClickHouse thought that two nanoseconds was longer than one second because they compared intervals just by the number, not the unit. And I complained about that a lot. And then they caused it to raise an error and just say you have to have the same unit. Then I complained a bit more. And I think as I understand it now, they have some. They convert between units. But like stuff like that, when all you're looking at is when a lot of what you're doing is comparing the duration of spans was really painful. Also things like you can't subtract two date times to get an interval. You have to use the date sub function. But like the fundamental thing is because we want our end users to write SQL, the like quality of the SQL, how easy it is to write, matters way more to us than if you're building like a platform on top where your developers are going to write the SQL. And once it's written and it's working, you don't mind too much. So I think that's like one of the fundamental differences. The other problem that I have with the ClickHouse and Impact Timescale is that like the ultimate architecture, the like snowflake architecture of binary data in object store queried with some kind of cache from nearby. They both have it, but it's closed sourced and you only get it if you go and use their hosted versions. And so even if we had got through all the problems with Timescale or ClickHouse, we would end up like, you know, they would want to be taking their 80% margin. And then we would be wanting to take that would basically leave us less space for margin. Whereas data fusion. Properly open source, all of that same tooling is open source. And for us as a team of people with a lot of Rust expertise, data fusion, which is implemented in Rust, we can literally dive into it and go and change it. So, for example, I found that there were some slowdowns in data fusion's string comparison kernel for doing like string contains. And it's just Rust code. And I could go and rewrite the string comparison kernel to be faster. Or, for example, data fusion, when we started using it, didn't have JSON support. Obviously, as I've said, it's something we can do. It's something we needed. I was able to go and implement that in a weekend using our JSON parser that we built for Pydantic Core. So it's the fact that like data fusion is like for us the perfect mixture of a toolbox to build a database with, not a database. And we can go and implement stuff on top of it in a way that like if you were trying to do that in Postgres or in ClickHouse. I mean, ClickHouse would be easier because it's C++, relatively modern C++. But like as a team of people who are not C++ experts, that's much scarier than data fusion for us.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:47:47]: Yeah, that's a beautiful rant.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:47:49]: That's funny. Most people don't think they have agency on these projects. They're kind of like, oh, I should use this or I should use that. They're not really like, what should I pick so that I contribute the most back to it? You know, so but I think you obviously have an open source first mindset. So that makes a lot of sense.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:48:05]: I think if we were probably better as a startup, a better startup and faster moving and just like headlong determined to get in front of customers as fast as possible, we should have just started with ClickHouse. I hope that long term we're in a better place for having worked with data fusion. We like we're quite engaged now with the data fusion community. Andrew Lam, who maintains data fusion, is an advisor to us. We're in a really good place now. But yeah, it's definitely slowed us down relative to just like building on ClickHouse and moving as fast as we can.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:48:34]: OK, we're about to zoom out and do Pydantic run and all the other stuff. But, you know, my last question on LogFire is really, you know, at some point you run out sort of community goodwill just because like, oh, I use Pydantic. I love Pydantic. I'm going to use LogFire. OK, then you start entering the territory of the Datadogs, the Sentrys and the honeycombs. Yeah. So where are you going to really spike here? What differentiator here?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:48:59]: I wasn't writing code in 2001, but I'm assuming that there were people talking about like web observability and then web observability stopped being a thing, not because the web stopped being a thing, but because all observability had to do web. If you were talking to people in 2010 or 2012, they would have talked about cloud observability. Now that's not a term because all observability is cloud first. The same is going to happen to gen AI. And so whether or not you're trying to compete with Datadog or with Arise and Langsmith, you've got to do first class. You've got to do general purpose observability with first class support for AI. And as far as I know, we're the only people really trying to do that. I mean, I think Datadog is starting in that direction. And to be honest, I think Datadog is a much like scarier company to compete with than the AI specific observability platforms. Because in my opinion, and I've also heard this from lots of customers, AI specific observability where you don't see everything else going on in your app is not actually that useful. Our hope is that we can build the first general purpose observability platform with first class support for AI. And that we have this open source heritage of putting developer experience first that other companies haven't done. For all I'm a fan of Datadog and what they've done. If you search Datadog logging Python. And you just try as a like a non-observability expert to get something up and running with Datadog and Python. It's not trivial, right? That's something Sentry have done amazingly well. But like there's enormous space in most of observability to do DX better.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:50:27]: Since you mentioned Sentry, I'm curious how you thought about licensing and all of that. Obviously, your MIT license, you don't have any rolling license like Sentry has where you can only use an open source, like the one year old version of it. Was that a hard decision?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:50:41]: So to be clear, LogFire is co-sourced. So Pydantic and Pydantic AI are MIT licensed and like properly open source. And then LogFire for now is completely closed source. And in fact, the struggles that Sentry have had with licensing and the like weird pushback the community gives when they take something that's closed source and make it source available just meant that we just avoided that whole subject matter. I think the other way to look at it is like in terms of either headcount or revenue or dollars in the bank. The amount of open source we do as a company is we've got to be open source. We're up there with the most prolific open source companies, like I say, per head. And so we didn't feel like we were morally obligated to make LogFire open source. We have Pydantic. Pydantic is a foundational library in Python. That and now Pydantic AI are our contribution to open source. And then LogFire is like openly for profit, right? As in we're not claiming otherwise. We're not sort of trying to walk a line if it's open source. But really, we want to make it hard to deploy. So you probably want to pay us. We're trying to be straight. That it's to pay for. We could change that at some point in the future, but it's not an immediate plan.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:51:48]: All right. So the first one I saw this new I don't know if it's like a product you're building the Pydantic that run, which is a Python browser sandbox. What was the inspiration behind that? We talk a lot about code interpreter for lamps. I'm an investor in a company called E2B, which is a code sandbox as a service for remote execution. Yeah. What's the Pydantic that run story?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:52:09]: So Pydantic that run is again completely open source. I have no interest in making it into a product. We just needed a sandbox to be able to demo LogFire in particular, but also Pydantic AI. So it doesn't have it yet, but I'm going to add basically a proxy to OpenAI and the other models so that you can run Pydantic AI in the browser. See how it works. Tweak the prompt, et cetera, et cetera. And we'll have some kind of limit per day of what you can spend on it or like what the spend is. The other thing we wanted to be able to do was to be able to when you log into LogFire. We have quite a lot of drop off of like a lot of people sign up, find it interesting and then don't go and create a project. And my intuition is that they're like, oh, OK, cool. But now I have to go and open up my development environment, create a new project, do something with the right token. I can't be bothered. And then they drop off and they forget to come back. And so we wanted a really nice way of being able to click here and you can run it in the browser and see what it does. As I think happens to all of us, I sort of started seeing if I could do it a week and a half ago. Got something to run. And then ended up, you know, improving it. And suddenly I spent a week on it. But I think it's useful. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:53:15]: I remember maybe a couple, two, three years ago, there were a couple of companies trying to build in the browser terminals exactly for this. It's like, you know, you go on GitHub, you see a project that is interesting, but now you got to like clone it and run it on your machine. Sometimes it can be sketchy. This is cool, especially since you already make all the docs runnable in your docs. Like you said, you kind of test them. It sounds like you might just have.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:53:39]: So, yeah. The thing is that on every example in Pydantic AI, there's a button that basically says run, which takes you into Pydantic.run, has that code there. And depending on how hard we want to push, we can also have it like hooked up to LogFire automatically. So there's a like, hey, just come and join the project. And you can see what that looks like in LogFire.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:53:58]: That's super cool.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:53:59]: So I think that's one of the biggest personally for me, one of the biggest drop offs from open source projects. It's kind of like do this. And then as long as something as soon as something doesn't work, I just drop off.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:54:09]: So it takes some discipline. You know, like there's been very many versions of this that I've been through in my career where you had to extract this code and run it. And it always falls out of date. Often we would have these this concept of transclusion where we have a separate code examples repo that we want to be that and that we pulled into our docs. And it never never really works. It takes a lot of discipline. So kudos to you on this.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:54:31]: And it was it was years of maintaining Pydantic and people complaining, hey, that example is out of date now. But eventually we went and built a PyTest example. Which is another the hardest to search for open source project we ever built. Because obviously, as you can imagine, if you search PyTest examples, you get examples of how to use PyTest. But the PyTest examples will basically go through both your code inside your doc strings to look for Python code and through markdown in your docs and extract that code and then run it for you and run linting over it and soon run type checking over it. So and that's how we keep our examples up to date. But now now we have these like hundreds of examples. All of which are runnable and self-contained. Or if they if they refer to the previous example, it's already structured that they have to be able to import the code from the previous example. So why don't we give someone a nice place to just be able to actually run that using OpenAI and see what the output is. Lovely.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:55:24]: All right. So that's kind of Pydantic. And the notes here, I just like going through people's X account, not Twitter. So for four years, you've been saying we need a plain text accessor to Jupyter notebooks. Yeah. I think people maybe have gone the other way, which may get even more opinionated, like with X and like all these kind of like notebook companies.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:55:46]: Well, yes. So in reply to that, someone replied and said Marimo is that. And sure enough, Marimo is really impressive. And I've subsequently spoken to spoken to the Marimo guys and got to angel invest in their account. I think it's SeedGround. So like Marimo is very cool. It's doing that. And Marimo also notebooks also run in the browser again using Pyodide. In fact, I nearly got there. We didn't build Pydantic.run because we were just going to use Marimo. But my concern was that people would think LogFire was only to be used in notebooks. And I wanted something that like ironically felt more basic, felt more like a terminal so that no one thought it was like just for notebooks. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:56:22]: There's a lot of notebook haters out there.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:56:24]: And indeed, I have very strong opinions about, you know, proper like Jupyter notebooks. This idea that like you have to run the cells in the right order. I mean, a whole bunch of things. It's basically like worse than Excel or similar. Similarly bad to Excel. Oh, so you are a notebook hater that invested in a notebook. I have this rant called notebook, which was like my attempt to build an alternative that is mostly just a rant about the 10 reasons why notebooks are just as bad as Excel. But Marimo et al, the new ones that are text-based, at least solve a whole bunch of those problems.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:56:58]: Agree with that. Yes. I was kind of wishing for something like a better notebook. And then I saw Marimo. I was like, oh, yeah, these guys have are ahead of me on this. Yeah. I don't know if I would do the sort of annotation-based thing. Like, you know, a lot of people love the, oh, annotate this function. And it just adds magic. I think similarly to what Jeremy Howard does with his stuff. It seems a little bit too magical still. But hey, it's a big improvement from notebooks. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:57:23]: Yeah. Great.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:57:24]: Just as on the LLM usage, like the IPyMB file, it's just not good to put in LLMs. So just that alone, I think should be okay.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:57:36]: It's just not good to put in LLMs.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [00:57:38]: It's really not. They freak out.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:57:41]: It's not good to put in Git either. I mean, I freak out.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:57:44]: Okay. Well, we will kill IPyMB at some point. Yeah. Any other takes? I was going to ask you just like, broaden out just about the London scene. You know, what's it like building out there, you know, over the pond?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:57:56]: I'm an evening person. And the good thing is that I can get up late and then work late because I'm speaking to people in the U.S. a lot of the time. So I got invited just earlier today to some drinks reception.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [00:58:09]: So I'm feeling positive about the U.K. right now on AI. But I think, look, like everywhere that isn't the U.S. and China knows that we're like way behind on AI. I think it's good that the U.K. is like beginning to say, this is an opportunity, not just a risk. I keep being told you should be at more events. You should be like, you know, hanging out with AI people more. My instinct is like, I'd rather sit at my computer and write code. I think that like, is probably a more effective way of getting people's attention. I'm like, I don't know. I mean, like a bit of me thinks I should be sitting on Twitter, not in San Francisco chatting to people. I think it's probably a bit of a mixture and I could probably do with being in the States a bit more. I think I'm going to be over there a bit more this year. But like, there's definitely the risk if you're in somewhere where everyone wants to chat to you about code where you don't write any code. And that's a failure mode.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:58:58]: I would say, yeah, definitely for sure. There's a scene and, you know, one way to really fail at this is to just be involved in that scene. And have that eat up your time, but be at the right events and the ones that I'm running are good events, hopefully.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [00:59:16]: What I say is like, use those things to produce high quality content that travels in a different medium than you normally would be able to. Because there's some selectivity, because there's a broad, there's a focused community on that thing. They will discover your work more. It will be highly produced, you know, that's the pitch over there on why at least I do conferences. And then in terms of talking to people, I always think about this, a three strikes rule. So after a while it gets repetitive, but maybe like the first 10, 20 conversations you have about people, if the same stuff is coming up, that is an indication to you that people like want a thing and it helps you prioritize in a more long form way than you can get in shallow interactions online, right? So that in person, eye to eye, like this is my pain at work and you see the pain and you're like, oh, okay. Like if I do this for you. You will love our tool and like, you can't really replace that. It's customer interviews. Really. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [01:00:11]: I agree entirely with that. I think that I think there's a, you're, you're right on a lot of that. And I think that like, it's very easy to get distracted by what people are saying on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><p><strong>Swyx</strong> [01:00:19]: That's another thing.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [01:00:20]: It's pretty hard to correct for which of those people are actually building this stuff in production in like serious companies and which of them are on day four of learning to code. Cause they have equally strident opinions and in like few characters, they, they seem equally valid. But which one's real and which one's not, or which one is from someone who really knows their stuff is, is hard to know.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [01:00:40]: Anything else, Sam? What do you want to get off your chest?</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [01:00:43]: Nothing in particular. I think we, I've really enjoyed our conversation. I would say, I think if anyone who is like looked at, at Pydance AI, we know it's not complete yet. We know there's a bunch of things that are missing embeddings, like storage, MCP and tool sets and stuff like that. We're trying to be deliberate and do stuff well. And that involves not being feature complete yet. Like keep coming back and looking in a few months because we're, we're pretty determined to get that. We know that this stuff is like, whether or not you think that AI is going to be the next Excel, the next internet or the next industrial revolution is going to affect all of us enormously. And so as a company, we get that like making Pydantic AI the best agent framework is existential for us.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [01:01:22]: You're also the first series A company I see that has no open roles for now. Every founder that comes in our podcast, the call to action is like, please come work with us.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [01:01:31]: We are not hiring right now. I want to, I would love, uh, bluntly for Logfire to have a bit more commercial traction and a bit more revenue before I, before I hire some more people. It's quite nice having a few years of runway, not a few months of runway. So I'm not in any, any great appetite to go and like destroy that runway overnight by hiring another, another 10 people. Even if like we, the whole team is like rushed off their feet, kind of doing, as you said, like three to four startups at the same time.</p><p><strong>Alessio</strong> [01:01:58]: Awesome, man. Thank you for joining us.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> [01:01:59]: Thank you very much.</p> <br></br><br></br>Get full access to Latent.Space at <a href="https://www.latent.space/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.latent.space/subscribe</a>

            Kotlin Notebook gets an upgrade! Check out the blog post to make your work with notebooks the most productive: <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/04/how-to-use-kotlin-notebooks-for-productive-development/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/04/how-to-use-kotlin-notebooks-for-productive-development/</a>

Kotlin Notebook is available in IntelliJ IDEA. It combines the power of Kotlin with the concept of “notebooks”.

A notebook in the programming world is a document that contains both code (which can be executed) and rich text elements (like paragraphs, equations, charts, and visuals).

The major benefit of notebooks is their interactivity: you can write a piece of code and run it to see the output immediately, making it a great tool for experimentation and learning. Notebooks also allow for the integration of text, code, and output (including visualizations) into a single document, which is very useful for presenting, documentation, and sharing work.

Kotlin notebooks extend this concept by enabling developers to use the Kotlin language in this interactive notebook environment. It means that you can write Kotlin code, execute it, and see the results within the notebook itself. This opens up new possibilities for Kotlin developers to work in a more exploratory, iterative way and to use their Kotlin skills in areas where interactive computation is needed.

Try Kotlin Notebook in your IntelliJ IDEA!

            Today, we're joined by Vijoy Pandey, SVP and general manager at Outshift by Cisco to discuss a foundational challenge for the enterprise: how do we make specialized agents from different vendors collaborate effectively? As companies like Salesforce, Workday, and Microsoft all develop their own agentic systems, integrating them creates a complex, probabilistic, and noisy environment, a stark contrast to the deterministic APIs of the past. Vijoy introduces Cisco's vision for an "Internet of Agents," a platform to manage this new reality, and its open-source implementation, AGNTCY. We explore the four phases of agent collaboration—discovery, composition, deployment, and evaluation—and dive deep into the communication stack, from syntactic protocols like A2A, ACP, and MCP to the deeper semantic challenges of creating a shared understanding between agents. Vijoy also unveils SLIM (Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging), a novel transport layer designed to make agent-to-agent communication quantum-safe, real-time, and efficient for multi-modal workloads.

            Patrick McGee is the author of Apple in China: The Capture of the World’s Greatest Company. Our discussion led us through a detailed history of Apple’s relationship with China, where iPhone manufacturing became a project of nation-building.

Cohosting today is Kyle Chan of the High Capacity Substack. 

Today, our conversation covers:


  Why Apple moved production to China in the 1990s, and why it struggles to leave,

  How Apple’s obsession with perfection catalyzed China’s industrial upgrading,

  The political side of production in China, including how Apple’s relationship with the Chinese authorities has evolved over time, 

  The rise of Foxconn and other partners in Apple’s network,

  Fun anecdotes about Apple’s management style, including the “Divorce Avoidance Program.”

<p><strong>Brian #2:</strong> <a href="https://willmcgugan.github.io/fixing-python-properties/?featured_on=pythonbytes">Fixing Python Properties</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Will McGugan</li>
<li>“Python properties work well with type checkers such Mypy and friends. … The type of your property is taken from the getter only. Even if your setter accepts different types, the type checker will complain on assignment.”</li>
<li>Will describes a way to get around this and make type checkers happy.</li>
<li>He replaces <code>@property</code> with a descriptor. It’s a cool technique.</li>
<li>I also like the way Will is allowing different ways to use a property such that it’s more convenient for the user. This is a cool deverloper usability trick.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brian #3: <a href="https://github.com/rohaquinlop/complexipy?featured_on=pythonbytes">complexipy</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Calculates the cognitive complexity of Python files, written in Rust.</li>
<li>Based on the cognitive complexity measurement described in a white paper by Sonar</li>
<li>Cognitive complexity builds on the idea of cyclomatic complexity.</li>
<li>Cyclomatic complexity was intended to measure the “testability and maintainability” of the control flow of a module. Sonar argues that it’s fine for testability, but doesn’t do well with measuring the “maintainability” part. So they came up with a new measure.</li>
<li>Cognitive complexity is intended to reflects the relative difficulty of understanding, and therefore of maintaining methods, classes, and applications.</li>
<li>complexipy essentially does that, but also has a really nice color output.</li>
<li>Note: at the very least, you should be using “cyclomatic complexity”
<ul>
<li>try with <code>ruff check --select C901</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But also try complexipy.</li>
<li>Great for understanding which functions might be ripe for refactoring, adding more documentation, surrounding with more tests, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>uv kernel for Jupyter</li>
<li>⚙️ <strong>Automatic Environment Setup:</strong> When the notebook is opened, Juvio installs the dependencies automatically in an ephemeral virtual environment (using <code>uv</code>), ensuring that the notebook runs with the correct versions of the packages and Python</li>
<li>📁 <strong>Git-Friendly Format:</strong> Notebooks are converted on the fly to a script-style format using <code># %%</code> markers, making diffs and version control painless</li>
<li>Why Use Juvio?
<ul>
<li>No additional lock or requirements files are needed</li>
<li>Guaranteed reproducibility</li>
<li>Cleaner Git diffs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Powered By

            <p>On this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Brian Morrison, Senior Developer Educator at Clerk. They cover the state of authentication today, what makes Clerk stand out for small teams and indie builders, and how thoughtful developer experience design can make or break adoption.Brian shares why bundling tools like auth, billing, and user management is becoming more common, how Clerk handles real-world concerns like bot protection and social login, and why starting with a great developer experience matters more than ever.The conversation also explores the role of AI in software development and content creation, where it helps, where it hurts, and how to use it responsibly without losing quality or trust.Keypoints for this Episode:</p><ul><li>Modern auth is about experience, not just security. Clerk simplifies user management, social login, bot protection, and subscription billing with developer-friendly APIs and polished default UIs.</li></ul><ul><li>Bundled platforms are making a comeback. Developers are shifting from handpicking tools to using tightly integrated services that reduce setup time and complexity.</li></ul><ul><li>Developer education needs more care and creativity. Brian emphasizes the importance of visual storytelling, thoughtful structure, and anticipating confusion to help devs learn faster and retain more.</li></ul><ul><li>AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement. The group discusses how AI can accelerate development and content creation when used with oversight, but warn against using it to blindly build entire apps.</li></ul><p>Follow Brian Morrison on Social MediaTwitter: <a href="https://x.com/brianmmdev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">https://x.com/brianmmdev</a>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmmdev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmmdev/</a>Sponsored by This Dot: <a href="thisdotlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">thisdotlabs.com</a></p>

Right now on LM Arena, DeepSeek v3 has a score of 1319, right under the full o1 model, Gemini 2, and 4o latest. <strong>This makes it the best open weights model in the world in January 2025.</strong></p><p>There has been a big recent trend in Chinese labs releasing very large open weights models, with TenCent releasing <a target="_blank" href="https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-tencents-hunyuan-large-claims-to-beat/"><strong>Hunyuan-Large in November</strong></a> and Hailuo releasing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1a88y/minimaxtext01_a_powerful_new_moe_language_model/"><strong>MiniMax-Text</strong></a> this week, both over 400B in size. However these extra-large language models are very difficult to serve.</p><p><strong>Baseten</strong> was the first of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latent.space/p/gpu-bubble">Inference neocloud startups</a> to get DeepSeek V3 online, because of their H200 clusters, their close collaboration with the DeepSeek team and early support of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang">SGLang</a>, a relatively new VLLM alternative that is also used at frontier labs like X.ai. Each H200 has 141 GB of VRAM with 4.8 TB per second of bandwidth, meaning that you can use 8 H200's in a node to inference DeepSeek v3 in FP8, taking into account KV Cache needs. </p><p>We have been close to Baseten since Sarah Guo introduced Amir Haghighat to swyx, and they supported the very first <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latent.space/p/jan-2023-update?open=false#%C2%A7generative-ai-hackathon-sf-feb">Latent Space Demo Day</a> in San Francisco, which was effectively the trial run for swyx and Alessio to work together! </p><p>Since then, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/philip_kiely/status/1872408515182207394"><strong>Philip Kiely</strong></a> also led a well attended workshop on TensorRT LLM at the 2024 World's Fair. </p><p>We worked with him to get two of their best representatives, Amir and Lead Model Performance Engineer <strong>Yineng Zhang</strong>, to discuss DeepSeek, SGLang, and everything they have learned running Mission Critical Inference workloads at scale for some of the largest AI products in the world.</p><p>The Three Pillars of Mission Critical Inference</p><p>We initially planned to focus the conversation on SGLang, but Amir and Yineng were quick to correct us that the choice of inference framework is only the simplest, first choice of 3 things you need for production inference at scale:</p><p>“I think it takes three things, and each of them individually is necessary but not sufficient: </p><p>* <strong>Performance at the model level</strong>: how fast are you running this one model running on a single GPU, let's say. The framework that you use there can, can matter. The techniques that you use there can matter. The MLA technique, for example, that Yineng mentioned, or the CUDA kernels that are being used. But there's also techniques being used at a higher level, things like speculative decoding with draft models or with Medusa heads. And these are implemented in the different frameworks, or you can even implement it yourself, but they're not necessarily tied to a single framework. But using speculative decoding gets you massive upside when it comes to being able to handle high throughput. <strong>But that's not enough. Invariably, that one model running on a single GPU, let's say, is going to get too much traffic that it cannot handle.</strong></p><p>* <strong>Horizontal scaling at the cluster/region level: </strong>And at that point, you need to horizontally scale it. That's not an ML problem. That's not a PyTorch problem. That's an infrastructure problem. How quickly do you go from, <strong>a single replica of that model to 5, to 10, to 100</strong>. And so that's the second, that's the second pillar that is necessary for running these machine critical inference workloads.</p><p>And what does it take to do that? It takes, some people are like, Oh, You just need Kubernetes and Kubernetes has an autoscaler and that just works. That doesn't work for, for these kinds of mission critical inference workloads. And <strong>you end up catching yourself wanting to bit by bit to rebuild those infrastructure pieces from scratch</strong>. This has been our experience. </p><p>* And then going even a layer beyond that, Kubernetes runs in a single. cluster. It's a single cluster. It's a single region tied to a single region. And when it comes to inference workloads and needing GPUs more and more, you know, we're seeing this that you cannot meet the demand inside of a single region. A single cloud's a single region. In other words, a single model might want to horizontally scale up to 200 replicas, each of which is, let's say, 2H100s or 4H100s or even a full node, you run into limits of the capacity inside of that one region. And what we had to build to get around that was <strong>the ability to have a single model have replicas across different regions</strong>. So, you know, there are models on Baseten today that have 50 replicas in GCP East and, 80 replicas in AWS West and Oracle in London, etc.</p><p>* <strong>Developer experience for Compound AI Systems: </strong>The final one is wrapping the power of the first two pillars in a very good developer experience to be able to afford certain workflows like the ones that I mentioned, around <a target="_blank" href="https://www.baseten.co/blog/baseten-chains-explained/">multi step, multi model inference workloads</a>, because more and more we're seeing that the market is moving towards those that the needs are generally in these sort of more complex workflows. </p><p>We think they said it very well.</p><p></p><p>Show Notes</p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirhaghighat/">Amir Haghighat</a>, Co-Founder, Baseten</p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhyncs/">Yineng Zhang</a>, Lead Software Engineer, Model Performance, Baseten</p><p></p><p>Full YouTube Episode</p><p>Please <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KjH7Gl0_pq0">like and subscribe</a>!</p><p>Timestamps</p><p>* <strong>00:00</strong> Introduction and Latest AI Model Launch</p><p>* <strong>00:11</strong> DeepSeek v3: Specifications and Achievements</p><p>* <strong>03:10</strong> Latent Space Podcast: Special Guests Introduction</p><p>* <strong>04:12</strong> DeepSeek v3: Technical Insights</p><p>* <strong>11:14</strong> Quantization and Model Performance</p><p>* <strong>16:19</strong> MOE Models: Trends and Challenges</p><p>* <strong>18:53</strong> Baseten's Inference Service and Pricing</p><p>* <strong>31:13</strong> Optimization for DeepSeek</p><p>* <strong>31:45</strong> Three Pillars of Mission Critical Inference Workloads</p><p>* <strong>32:39</strong> Scaling Beyond Single GPU</p><p>* <strong>33:09</strong> Challenges with Kubernetes and Infrastructure</p><p>* <strong>33:40</strong> Multi-Region Scaling Solutions</p><p>* <strong>35:34</strong> SG Lang: A New Framework</p><p>* <strong>38:52</strong> Key Techniques Behind SG Lang</p><p>* <strong>48:27</strong> Speculative Decoding and Performance</p><p>* <strong>49:54</strong> Future of Fine-Tuning and RLHF</p><p>* <strong>01:00:28</strong> Baseten's V3 and Industry Trends</p><p></p><p>Baseten’s previous TensorRT LLM workshop:</p> <br></br><br></br>Get full access to Latent.Space at <a href="https://www.latent.space/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.latent.space/subscribe</a>

        <p>Building software is difficult and rarely can software engineers do it alone. In this episode, Kris is joined by Ian, Matthew, and Angelica to talk managing software projects and what three often used but rarely defined roles actually mean: project manager, product manager, and program manager. The panel also discusses how these roles interact with engineering managers, what they think these roles actually do, and whether product managers should actually exist.</p><p>For our supporters, this episode contains an extended discussion including a discussion on whether you should trust a new company you join, how to build trust, and what metrics we should measure for project success.

            In this podcast, Michael Stiefel spoke with Rashmi Venugopal about two topics. The first is how the middle-tier creates the application from the raw materials in the back-end,  and how the front-end uses the middle-tier to present a meaningful workflow to the user.  The second is how to manage the usually inevitable software migration that results from a successful software product.

        <div class="description">
            <p>The line between generic AI capabilities and truly transformative business applications often comes down to one thing: your data. While foundation models provide impressive general intelligence, they lack the specialized knowledge needed for domain-specific tasks that drive real business value. But how do you effectively bridge this gap? What's the difference between simply fine-tuning models versus using techniques like retrieval-augmented generation? And with constantly evolving models and technologies, how do you build systems that remain adaptable while still delivering consistent results? Whether you're in retail, healthcare, or transportation, understanding how to properly enrich, annotate, and leverage your proprietary data could be the difference between an AI project that fails and one that fundamentally transforms your business.</p><p>Wendy Gonzalez is the CEO — and former COO — of Sama, a company leading the way in ethical AI by delivering accurate, human-annotated data while advancing economic opportunity in underserved communities. She joined Sama in 2015 and has been central to scaling both its global operations and its mission-driven business model, which has helped over 65,000 people lift themselves out of poverty through dignified digital work. With over 20 years of experience in the tech and data space, Wendy’s held leadership roles at EY, Capgemini, and Cycle30, where she built and managed high-performing teams across complex, global environments. Her leadership style blends operational excellence with deep purpose — ensuring that innovation doesn’t come at the expense of integrity. Wendy is also a vocal advocate for inclusive AI and sustainable impact, regularly speaking on how companies can balance cutting-edge technology with real-world responsibility.</p><p>Duncan Curtis is the Senior Vice President of Generative AI at Sama, where he leads the development of AI-powered tools that are shaping the future of data annotation. With a background in product leadership and machine learning, Duncan has spent his career building scalable systems that bridge cutting-edge technology with real-world impact. Before joining Sama, he led teams at companies like Google, where he worked on large-scale personalization systems, and contributed to AI product strategy across multiple sectors. At Sama, he's focused on harnessing the power of generative AI to improve quality, speed, and efficiency — all while keeping human oversight and ethical practices at the core. Duncan brings a unique perspective to the AI space: one that’s grounded in technical expertise, but always oriented toward practical solutions and responsible innovation.</p><p>In the episode, Richie, Wendy, and Duncan explore the importance of using specialized data with large language models, the role of data enrichment in improving AI accuracy, the balance between automation and human oversight, the significance of responsible AI practices, and much more.</p><p><strong>Links Mentioned in the Show:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.sama.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sama</a></li><li>Connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendy-gonzalez-a319788" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wendy</a></li><li>Connect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-curtis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Duncan</a></li><li><a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/generative-ai-concepts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Course: Generative AI Concepts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/podcast/creating-high-quality-ai-applications" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Related Episode: Creating High Quality AI Applications with Theresa Parker & Sudhi Balan, Rocket Software</a></li><li><a href="https://www.datacamp-staging.com/radar/ai-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Register for RADAR AI</a></li></ul><br></br><p><strong>New to DataCamp?</strong></p><ul><li>Learn on the go...</li></ul>

            <p>In this episode, we spoke to Kirsten Hill.</p><p>Dr Kirsten Hill is a researcher, writer, and the founder of bisque — a survey platform that actually cares if you get good data. She has a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, has led research for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and has worked with over 100 mission-driven teams on measurement & evaluation. This past year, she authored her first book, Ask Better Questions, a top release on survey design — and realized that writing the book wasn’t enough. If she really wanted to change how people do research, she had to build the tools that would make it easier to do it right. With real-time AI feedback, intuitive design, and built-in best practices, bisque makes it easy to create surveys that get you the answers you actually need.</p><p>We spoke to Kirsten about how and why surveys are often bad, why she believes the major survey platforms aren't fit for purpose, why she's building her own survey platform "bisque", how she's using Large Language Models to develop a working prototype, and what advice she has for other non-programmers who want to build things with AI.</p><p>You can find her on:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstenleehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenleehill</a></li><li>TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirstenleehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenleehill</a></li><li>Substack <a href="https://kirstenleehill.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kirstenleehill.substack.com</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p>---</p><p>David’s book, The Well-Grounded Data Analyst is out! <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst">⁠https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst⁠</a></p><p>If you want to find out more, we have a whole episode about it: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5D0iDtQRh3tWiIhokrjz3x?si=AiX6YyRET16lnzXDlvdcfw">⁠https://open.spotify.com/episode/5D0iDtQRh3tWiIhokrjz3x?si=AiX6YyRET16lnzXDlvdcfw</a></p>

            <p>In this episode of AI + a16z, Anthropic's David Soria Parra — who created MCP (Model Context Protocol) along with Justin Spahr-Summers — sits down with a16z's Yoko Li to discuss the project's inception, exciting use cases for connecting LLMs to external sources, and what's coming next for the project. If you're unfamiliar with the wildly popular MCP project, this edited passage from their discussion is a great starting point to learn:</p><p><strong>David: </strong>"MCP tries to enable building AI applications in such a way that they can be extended by everyone else that is not part of the original development team through these MCP servers, and really bring the workflows you care about, the things you want to do, to these AI applications. It's a protocol that just defines how whatever you are building as a developer for that integration piece, and that AI application, talk to each other. </p><p>"It's a very boring specification, but what it enables is hopefully ... something that looks like the current API ecosystem, but for LLM interactions."</p><p><strong>Yoko: "</strong>I really love the analogy with the API ecosystem, because they give people a mental model of how the ecosystem evolves ... Before, you may have needed a different spec to query Salesforce versus query HubSpot. Now you can use similarly defined API schema to do that.</p><p>"And then when I saw MCP earlier in the year, it was very interesting in that it almost felt like a standard interface for the agent to interface with LLMs. It's like, 'What are the set of things that the agent wants to execute on that it has never seen before? What kind of context does it need to make these things happen?' When I tried it out, it was just super powerful and I no longer have to build one tool per client. I now can build just one MCP server, for example, for sending emails, and I use it for everything on Cursor, on Claude Desktop, on Goose."</p><p>Learn more:</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/a-deep-dive-into-mcp-and-the-future-of-ai-tooling/" target="_blank">A Deep Dive Into MCP and the Future of AI Tooling</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/what-is-an-ai-agent/" target="_blank">What Is an AI Agent?</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/benchmarking-ai-agents-on-full-stack-coding/" target="_blank">Benchmarking AI Agents on Full-Stack Coding</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/agent-experience-building-an-open-web-for-the-ai-era/" target="_blank">Agent Experience: Building an Open Web for the AI Era</a></p><p>Follow everyone on X:</p><p><a href="https://x.com/dsp_" target="_blank">David Soria Parra</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/stuffyokodraws" target="_blank">Yoko Li</a></p>

            Hugo Bowne-Anderson hosts a panel discussion from the MLOps World and Generative AI Summit in Austin, exploring the long-term growth of AI by distinguishing real problem-solving from trend-based solutions. If you're navigating the evolving landscape of generative AI, productionizing models, or questioning the hype, this episode dives into the tough questions shaping the field.
The panel features:  
- Ben Taylor (Jepson) (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jepsontaylor/)">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jepsontaylor/)</a> – CEO and Founder at VEOX Inc., with experience in AI exploration, genetic programming, and deep learning.  
- Joe Reis (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/)">https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/)</a> – Co-founder of Ternary Data and author of Fundamentals of Data Engineering.  
- Juan Sequeda (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansequeda/)">https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansequeda/)</a> – Principal Scientist and Head of AI Lab at Data.World, known for his expertise in knowledge graphs and the semantic web.  
The discussion unpacks essential topics such as:  
- The shift from prompt engineering to goal engineering—letting AI iterate toward well-defined objectives.  
- Whether generative AI is having an electricity moment or more of a blockchain trajectory.  
- The combinatorial power of AI to explore new solutions, drawing parallels to AlphaZero redefining strategy games.  
- The POC-to-production gap and why AI projects stall.  
- Failure modes, hallucinations, and governance risks—and how to mitigate them.  
- The disconnect between executive optimism and employee workload.  
Hugo also mentions his upcoming workshop on escaping Proof-of-Concept Purgatory, which has evolved into a Maven course "Building LLM Applications for Data Scientists and Software Engineers" launching in January (<a href="https://maven.com/hugo-stefan/building-llm-apps-ds-and-swe-from-first-principles?utm_campaign=8123d0&utm_medium=partner&utm_source=instructor).">https://maven.com/hugo-stefan/building-llm-apps-ds-and-swe-from-first-principles?utm_campaign=8123d0&utm_medium=partner&utm_source=instructor).</a> Vanishing Gradient listeners can get 25% off the course (use the code VG25), with $1,000 in Modal compute credits included.
A huge thanks to Dave Scharbach and the Toronto Machine Learning Society for organizing the conference and to the audience for their thoughtful questions.
As we head into the new year, this conversation offers a reality check amidst the growing AI agent hype.

            While Silicon Valley chases unicorns, Josh Wolfe hunts for something far more elusive: scientific breakthroughs that could change civilization. As co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital, he's looking for the kind of science that turns impossible into inevitable. Josh doesn’t just invest in the future—he sees it coming before almost anyone else. 
 
In this conversation, we explore: 

The rapid evolution of AI and potential bottlenecks slowing its growth 

The geopolitical battle for technological dominance and rise of sovereign AI models 

How advances in automation, robotics, and defence are shifting global power dynamics 

Josh's unfiltered thoughts on Tesla and Elon Musk 

AI's revolution of medical research 

Parenting in a tech-dominated world 

How AI is forcing us to rethink creativity, intellectual property, and human intelligence itself 

Why the greatest risk isn't AI itself—but our ability to separate truth from noise 

 
Despite the challenges ahead, Josh remains profoundly optimistic about human potential. He believes technology isn't replacing what makes us human—it's amplifying it. This episode will challenge how you think about innovation, risk, and the forces shaping our future. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, you can't afford to miss it. 
 
Josh Wolfe co-founded Lux Capital to support scientists and entrepreneurs who pursue counter-conventional solutions to the most vexing puzzles of our time. He previously worked in investment banking at Salomon Smith Barney and in capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Josh is a columnist with Forbes and Editor for the Forbes/Wolfe Emerging Tech Report.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the challenges of authentication for agents, moving beyond human-in-the-loop processes and complex systems like OAuth2 towards more agent-friendly, secure, and auditable solutions, possibly involving dedicated agent user identities.</p><br><p>The dialogue also covers practical considerations like providing data to LLMs efficiently, the importance of API accessibility for agents, and the need for businesses to adapt to this new paradigm of interaction. Finally, the conversation underscores that AX is a rapidly evolving area, transitioning from theoretical concepts to practical applications, with a strong call for community collaboration to develop best practices and robust solutions for the future of agent-driven web interactions.</p><br><p>Chapters</p><br><p>00:00 Intro</p><p>03:35 Exploring Agent Experience (AX) and Its Importance</p><p>06:23 Understanding the Role of Model Context Protocol (MCP)</p><p>09:22 The Principles of Great Agent Experience</p><p>12:24 Agent Accessibility and Its Challenges</p><p>15:34 Contextual Alignment: Enhancing Agent Interaction</p><p>18:31 Human-Centric Design in Agent Experience</p><p>21:23 The Future of AI and Agent Experiences</p><p>24:25 Improving Human Accessibility Through Agentic Experiences</p><p>27:29 Primitives of Agent Accessibility</p><p>30:22 Avoiding Human in the Loop Patterns</p><p>33:19 Authentication in an Agentic World</p><p>38:34 Navigating API Token Strategies</p><p>43:30 Contextual Alignment: The Next Frontier</p><p>55:50 Understanding Agents vs. Bots</p><p>01:00:19 Optimizing Contextual Alignment for Agents</p><p>01:14:11 Understanding Website Infrastructure and Cost Implications</p><p>01:14:37 The Role of LLMs in Web Navigation</p><p>01:17:54 Quantifying ROI in Web Technologies</p><p>01:19:43 Introduction to Arazo and Workflow Management</p><p>01:24:26 Measuring Human vs. Agent Interaction</p><p>01:30:28 The Emergence of Agent Experience (AX)</p><p>01:38:09 Five Principles of Agent Experience (AX)</p><p><br></p><hr><p style="color:grey; font-size:0.75em;"> Hosted on Acast.

            What happens when one of the most legendary minds in tech delves deep into the real workings of modern AI? A 2-hour long masterclass that you don’t want to miss.
 
Bret Taylor, current chairman of OpenAI, unpacks why AI is transforming software engineering forever, how founders can survive acquisition (he’s done it twice), and why the true bottlenecks in AI aren’t what most think. Drawing on his extensive experiences at Facebook, Google, Twitter and more, he explains why the next phase of AI won’t just be about building better models—it’s about creating entirely new ways for us to work with them. Bret exposes the reality gap between what AI insiders understand and what everyone else believes.

            What if the cost of writing code dropped to zero — but the cost of understanding it skyrocketed?
In this episode, Hugo sits down with Joe Reis to unpack how AI tooling is reshaping the software development lifecycle — from experimentation and prototyping to deployment, maintainability, and everything in between.
Joe is the co-author of Fundamentals of Data Engineering and a longtime voice on the systems side of modern software. He’s also one of the sharpest critics of “vibe coding” — the emerging pattern of writing software by feel, with heavy reliance on LLMs and little regard for structure or quality.
We dive into:
    • Why “vibe coding” is more than a meme — and what it says about how we build today
    • How AI tools expand the surface area of software creation — for better and worse
    • What happens to technical debt, testing, and security when generation outpaces understanding
    • The changing definition of “production” in a world of ephemeral, internal, or just-good-enough tools
    • How AI is flattening the learning curve — and threatening the talent pipeline
    • Joe’s view on what real craftsmanship means in an age of disposable code
This conversation isn’t about doom, and it’s not about hype. It’s about mapping the real, messy terrain of what it means to build software today — and how to do it with care.

            Flo Crivello, CEO of AI agent platform Lindy, provides a candid deep dive into the current state of AI agents, cutting through hype to reveal what's actually working in production versus what remains challenging. The conversation explores practical implementation details including model selection, fine-tuning, RAG systems, tool design philosophy, and why most successful "AI agents" today are better described as intelligent workflows with human-designed structure. Flo shares insights on emerging capabilities like more open-ended agents, discusses his skepticism about extrapolating current progress trends too far into the future, and explains why scaffolding will remain critical even as we approach AGI. This technical discussion is packed with practical nuggets for AI engineers and builders working on agent systems.

But one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today, that I particularly care about, is how to unlock the true potential of AI by leveraging a company’s operational business data. At Snow Leopard, we aim to bridge the gap between AI systems and critical business data that is locked away in databases, data warehouses, and other API-based systems, so enterprises can use live business data from any data source – whether it's database, warehouse, or APIs – in real time and on demand, natively. In this interview, I'd like to cover Snow Leopard’s intelligent data retrieval approach that can leverage business data directly and on-demand to make AI work.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>// Bio</p><p><br></p><p>Deepti is the founder and CEO of Snow Leopard AI, a platform that helps teams build AI apps using their live business data, on-demand. She has nearly 2 decades of experience in data platforms and infrastructure.</p><p>As Head of Product at Observable, Deepti led the 0→1 product and GTM strategy in the crowded data analytics market. Before that, Deepti was the founding PM for Google Spanner, growing it to thousands of internal customers (Ads, PlayStore, Gmail, etc.), before launching it externally as a seminal cloud database service. Deepti started her career as a distributed systems engineer in the RAC database kernel at Oracle.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>// Related Links</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.snowleopard.ai/</p><p><br></p><p>AI">https://www.snowleopard.ai/</p><p><br></p><p>AI</a> SQL Data Analyst // Donné Stevenson - <a href="https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~">https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~</a> ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href="https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join">https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join</a> our Slack community [<a href="https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow">https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow</a> us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](<a href="https://x.com/mlopscommunity)">https://x.com/mlopscommunity)</a> or [LinkedIn](<a href="https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)]">https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)]</a> </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [<a href="https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps">https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps</a> Swag/Merch: [<a href="https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect">https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect</a> with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Deepti on LinkedIn: /thedeepti/</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Timestamps:</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[00:00] Deepti's preferred coffee</p><p>[00:49] MLflow vs Kubeflow Debate</p><p>[04:58] GenAI Data Integration Challenges</p><p>[09:02] GenAI Sidecar Spicy Takes</p><p>[14:07] Troubleshooting LLM Hallucinations</p><p>[19:03] AI Overengineering and Hype</p><p>[25:06] Self-Serve Analytics Governance</p><p>[33:29] Dashboards vs Data Quality</p><p>[37:06] Agent Database Context Control</p><p>[43:00] LLM as Orchestrator</p><p>[47:34] Tool Call Ownership Clarification</p><p>[51:45] MCP Server Challenges</p><p>[56:52] Wrap up</p>
