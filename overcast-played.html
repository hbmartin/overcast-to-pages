            <p>In this special in-person episode, Sanne Grinovero shares the story of Java’s evolution from his unique perspective as a long-time open-source contributor. He shares his 16-year career journey at Red Hat, highlighting his amazing work on key projects like Hibernate, Infinispan, and especially the creation of Quarkus. His career trajectory, from a student who initially disliked Java’s complexity to a leading figure in its modernization, shows the transformative power of open source.</p><p>A key part of the conversation focuses on how technical challenges spark innovation. Sanne explains how the task of making the popular Hibernate framework compatible with GraalVM’s limitations led directly to the birth of Quarkus.

        <p>Error handling in Go is one of the language's most controversial topics. It ranks high in each Go Developer Survey and many different people have proposed many different solutions to the perceived problems. The Go Team's stance on error handling as a problem in need of a fix has changed recently, with a declaration that no proposals will be accepted for changes to Go's error handling syntax. In this episode, Kris is joined by Ian and Matt to discuss this news. They talk about whether error handling has ever actually been a problem, what the Go team actually is, and the benefits of deciding not to provided syntactic support for error handling.</p><p>For our supporters, this episode contains an extended discussion.

            <p>On this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, hosts Rob Ocel, Danny Thompson, and Adam Rackis are joined by Tejas Kumar, host of <em>The Contagious Code</em> podcast, author of <em>Fluent React</em>, and Developer Relations Engineer for Generative AI at DataStax. They unpack the current wave of AI announcements from Google I/O and Microsoft Build, and zoom in on the significance of MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a foundational shift in how AI-powered apps will be built and used.</p><p>Tejas breaks down what MCP is, why it's catching on across the industry, and how it could become the HTTP of AI apps. The group explores real-world examples, like AI apps managing your inbox or booking flights without ever opening a browser, and discuss how MCP servers enable secure, agent-driven experiences that can act on your behalf. They also touch on hallucinations, the role of fine-tuning vs. tool integration, and the future of checkout flows powered by AI agents.</p><p><br></p><p>Keypoints from this Episode:</p><p>- MCP enables structured communication between AI apps and servers, allowing agents to perform real tasks like sending emails or booking flights</p><p>- Users will increasingly interact with applications through natural language, with agents handling workflows behind the scenes</p><p>- Connecting models to tools via MCP helps reduce hallucinations by ensuring actions and responses are grounded in real data</p><p>- Most use cases benefit more from retrieval-augmented generation and strong tool integration than from expensive model fine-tuning</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Tejas on Social Media</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/TejasKumar_⁠" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><u>https://x.com/TejasKumar_</u></a></p><p>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejasq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejasq/</a><br></p>

Apart from helping her regulate her emotions, it prompted Nadia to reexamine deep questions of our human existence. </p></li><li><p><strong>Self-talk is not essential as it seems. </strong>Nadia describes how advanced meditation quieted her inner voice—challenging the idea that self-talk is core to being human.</p></li><li><p><strong>How years of cultural evolution have shaped our sense of self. </strong>According to Nadia, our modern conception of “self”  isn’t as timeless as we assume. She draws on psychologist Julian Jaynes’s theory that our inner dialogue—what we often equate with consciousness—only emerged in humans a few thousand years ago; a provocation to reconsider the benchmarks we use to assess the intelligence or sentience of LLMs.</p></li><li><p><strong>What it is like to experience a “cessation.”</strong> On her last meditation retreat, Nadia experiences a cessation where your consciousness abruptly winks out—like suddenly flipping a switch. Nadia described it as slipping into nothingness, then returning with the jarring realization that even your sense of self can vanish and reappear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why she likes the unknowability of AI. </strong>The mechanics of exactly how LLMs predict their next token remain a mystery. Driven by thousands of subtle, context-dependent correlations, they’re too complex to distill into a simple explanation. Nadia finds joy in the unknowability of it all, seeing the ambiguity as an invitation to explore. </p></li><li><p><strong>How she uses AI as a writing partner. </strong>Nadia believes the trope of the solitary, brooding writer is beginning to shift with the rise of LLMs. For her, ChatGPT has made writing feel less isolating. She turns to it at both ends of the process: to help make sense of early ideas, and later, to sharpen phrasing and land on just the right words.</p></li></ul><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt</a>.

            What if the world’s most connected tech investor handed you his mental playbook? Elad Gil, an investor behind Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase and Anduril, flips conventional wisdom on its head and prioritizes market opportunities over founders. Elad decodes why innovation has clustered geographically throughout history, from Renaissance Florence to Silicon Valley, where today 25% of global tech wealth is created. We get into why he believes AI is dramatically under-hyped and still under-appreciated, why remote work hampers innovation, and the self-inflicted wounds that he's seen kill most startups.  

This is a masterclass in pattern recognition from one of tech's most consistent and accurate forecasters, revealing the counterintuitive principles behind identifying world-changing ideas. 

Disclaimer: This episode was recorded in January. The pace of AI development is staggering, and some of what we discussed has already evolved. But the mental models Elad shares about strategy, judgment, and high-agency thinking are timeless and will remain relevant for years to come.

            In this episode of The Cognitive Revolution, Ali Behrouz, a PhD student at Cornell University, delves into his research on enhancing memory mechanisms in large language models through his latest paper titled Titans. Behrouz discusses the limitations of current models in maintaining long-term coherence and introduces the concept of a neural network as a memory module. Highlighting architectures such as memory as context and memory as gate, he explains how these innovative approaches can significantly improve long-term memory retention in AI systems. The discussion also touches upon challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and the need for more effective models in reinforcement learning and decision-making tasks. This insightful conversation sheds light on the future directions and potential applications of advanced memory mechanisms in AI.

            Most accelerators fund ideas. Y Combinator funds founders—and transforms them. With a 1% acceptance rate and alumni behind 60% of the past decade’s unicorns, YC knows what separates the founders who break through from those who burn out. It's not the flashiest résumé or the boldest pitch but something President Garry Tan says is far rarer: earnestness. In this conversation, Garry reveals why this is the key to success, and how it can make or break a startup. We also dive into how AI is reshaping the whole landscape of venture capital and what the future might look like when everyone has intelligence on tap.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This purchase was really about building the data foundation needed for agentic AI to actually work in enterprise environments – we’re talking about combining Informatica’s 30 years of data management expertise with Salesforce’s cloud platform to create what they’re calling a “unified architecture for agentic AI.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This acquisition fills a massive gap in Salesforce’s data management capabilities, bringing in critical pieces like data cataloging, integration, governance, quality controls, and master data management – all the unsexy but absolutely essential plumbing that makes AI agents trustworthy and scalable in real enterprise deployments.</li>

            In a new essay published Tuesday called “The Gentle Singularity,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared his latest vision for how AI will change the human experience over the next 15 years. The essay is a classic example of Altman’s futurism: hyping up the promise of AGI — and arguing that his company is quite close.

        <p>Alex Levin, Co-Founder & CEO at Regal AI. Regal is the AI Agent Platform.</p><p>Generative AI Agents are transforming customer expectations and the types of customer experiences business can build. The biggest opportunity is in support, sales and operations calls at consumer businesses.</p><p>Episode Highlights:</p><p>- Alex challenges the long-standing “hide the phone number” mindset in contact centers. He argues that voice calls consistently outperform emails and texts in customer engagement, with far higher conversion and retention metrics when executed correctly.</p><p>- While many companies focus on building AI agents, Alex emphasizes that the real complexity lies in orchestration—pulling in customer data, handling routing, making API calls, and integrating with CRMs. Regal AI’s strength lies in building this full voice engagement stack.</p><p>- Regal’s AI agents now resolve ~97% of calls without needing a human handoff. This is a major leap from legacy benchmarks, which typically hover around 20–30%.</p><p>- Average handle time becomes less relevant with AI. Instead of optimizing for speed, Regal focuses on outcomes—like resolution, satisfaction, and conversion. Alex notes that AI often reduces call time by 30% anyway, while delivering better consistency and accuracy.</p><p>- Voice agents with personality outperform generic ones. Regal experiments with distinct agent styles—like playful, skeptical, or supportive—to mirror brand tone. Techniques like natural pauses, background noise, and tonal variation dramatically increase trust and engagement.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br>Connect with Alex Levin:<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlevin1/<br>https://www.regal.ai/</p><p>Connect">https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlevin1/<br>https://www.regal.ai/</p><p>Connect</a> with Demetrios:<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</p><p>Connect">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</p><p>Connect</a> with Deepgram:<br><a href="https://deepgram.com/<br>https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepgram<br>https://twitter.com/deepgramai<br>https://www.facebook.com/deepgram/</p><p>Join">https://deepgram.com/<br>https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepgram<br>https://twitter.com/deepgramai<br>https://www.facebook.com/deepgram/</p><p>Join</a> the Deepgram Discord Server!<br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/xWRaCDBtW4</p>">https://discord.com/invite/xWRaCDBtW4</p></a>

A primary challenge is determining whether automated traffic is coming from bad actors and troublesome bots, or perhaps AI agents trying to buy a product on behalf of a real customer.Joel and David dive into the challenge of analyzing every request without adding latency, and how faster inference at the edge opens up new possibilities for fraud prevention, content filtering, and even ad tech.Topics include:</p><ul><li>Why traditional threat analysis won’t work for the AI-powered web</li><li>The need for full-context security checks</li><li>How to perform sub-second, cost-effective inference</li><li>The wide range of potential actors and actions behind any given visit</li></ul><p>As David puts it, lower inference costs are key to letting apps act on the full context window — everything you know about the user, the session, and your application.</p><p>Follow everyone on social media:</p><p><a href="https://x.com/davidmytton" target="_blank">David Mytton</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/3448827723723234/" target="_blank">Joel de la Garza</a></p>

            The physical world is becoming digital—and it requires fundamentally different technical architecture than traditional IT systems. Bernd Groß leads technical leaders through the evolution from enterprise software to industrial IoT, where real-time data from 30,000 wind turbines and millisecond-level decision-making define system requirements.



As co-founder and CEO of Cumulocity, Bernd has navigated one of tech's most complex domains: connecting industrial hardware through standardized platforms. His journey from Nokia's early cloud computing initiatives to building Germany's leading IoT platform offers unique insights on technical leadership in physical-digital convergence.



Technical leaders will gain valuable perspectives on:

• 🏗️ Architecting speed-layer systems that handle 50TB monthly data flows while maintaining real-time responsiveness

• 🔄 Managing technical debt across hundreds of industrial protocols while modernizing from monoliths to microservices

• 🤖 Implementing "AI-IoT" strategies that bridge machine learning models with operational technology deployments

• ⚡ Building edge-cloud hybrid architectures for regulated environments and latency-critical applications

• 🛠️ Engineering platforms that scale from device management to data operationalization across industrial verticals

They also look at how power user feedback shapes tools like the AWS Pricing Calculator, why storytelling matters more than specs, and what it’s like co-presenting with notes that say “make the rabbit joke.” They also discuss AWS’s internal planning process, how customers can get involved in talks, and where to catch them next.<br></p><p><strong>Show Highlights</strong></p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(1:38) The Duckbill Group sponsor read</p><p>(2:35) The importance of collecting feedback before launching a product </p><p>(4:52) The difference between the intended use of a product and how it’s actually used</p><p>(8:52) How Bowen and Matt were able to be so prepared for their presentation</p><p>(13:01) What many people don’t realize goes into practicing for a presentation</p><p>(17:14) How having a storyline helped Bowen and Matt facilitate better breakout sessions</p><p>(18:26) The Duckbill Group sponsor read</p><p>(21:02) The importance of being able to go with the flow during presentations</p><p>(22:42) Why knowing your audience is essential for having a good presentation</p><p>(24:32) Choosing between breadth and depth when giving presentations</p><p>(25:05) Bowen and Matt’s advice for people who want to have their opportunity to give a talk with an AWS service team</p><p>(34:22) How to keep up with Matt and Bowen<br></p><p><strong>About Matt Berk</strong></p><p>Matt Berk is an AWS Principal Technical Account Manager at based in Brooklyn who's passionate about storytelling, cloud technologies, and FinOps.

            <p>Yaroslav Lazor started writing code when he was 10 years old. It took him a while to understand that making a difference in the world wasn't just about writing code - but he has arrived there these days. He is the father of 4 daughters, 2 of which are artists and a couple who are digging into their entrepreneurial roots with running their own lemonade stand. He lives in Los Angeles, and has learned to be a better person through pushing himself as a founder.</p><p>Sergiy Korolov also started coding when he was young, though 4 years later than Yaroslav. He went to a technical university, and as his career in leadership grew, the number of lines of code he contributed to decreased. He is located in Poland, and loves to snowboard in the winter, and bike in the summer. He has 3 kids, and recently started teaching coding to his oldest son.</p><p>Yaroslav & Sergiy were building software for clients, the typical Ukrainian software route. Over time, they realized that building their own products was the best way to make an impact - so much so, that they decided to start building their own.</p><p>This is the creation story of <a href="https://railsware.com/" rel="nofollow">Railsware</a>.</p><p>Sponsors</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.paddle.com/" rel="nofollow">Paddle.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.semasoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">Sema Software</a></li><li><a href="https://www.propelauth.com/" rel="nofollow">PropelAuth</a></li></ul><p>Links</p><ul><li><a href="https://railsware.com/" rel="nofollow">https://railsware.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylazor/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylazor/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiykorolov/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiykorolov/</a></li></ul><p><br></p><br></br><br></br>Our Sponsors:<br></br>* Check out Kinsta: <a href="https://kinsta.com<br/>*">https://kinsta.com<br></br>*</a> Check out Vanta: <a href="https://vanta.com/CODESTORY<br/><br/><br/>Support">https://vanta.com/CODESTORY<br></br><br></br><br></br>Support</a> this podcast at â <a rel="payment" href="https://redcircle.com/code-story/donations">https://redcircle.com/code-story/donations</a><br></br><br></br>Advertising Inquiries: <a href="https://redcircle.com/brands">https://redcircle.com/brands</a><br></br><br></br>Privacy & Opt-Out: <a href="https://redcircle.com/privacy">https://redcircle.com/privacy</a>

They explore practical strategies for getting better results from large language models. Zvi explains how to customize AI behavior through thoughtful system prompts, while Patrick shares techniques for using LLMs as writing partners and research assistants. They discuss the evolving relationship between content creators and AI training data, touching on the emerging field of "generative engine optimization" (GEO). The conversation also covers multimodal capabilities, recursive AI use, and strategies for avoiding common failure modes like hallucination and sycophancy. <br>–<br>Full transcript: <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/getting-better-at-llms-with-zvi-mowshowitz/">www.complexsystemspodcast.com/getting-better-at-llms-with-zvi-mowshowitz/</a></p><p>–</p><p>Sponsor:  Vanta</p><p><a href="https://vanta.com/complex">Vanta</a> automates security compliance and builds trust, helping companies streamline ISO, SOC 2, and AI framework certifications.

            Renaissance Philanthropy — in my opinion, the most exciting S&T philanthropic venture in the US — is getting a one-year check-in. Kumar Garg first appeared on the show right before I went on paternity leave, and now we’re back for round two. Before founding Renaissance Philanthropy, Kumar worked in the Obama Office of Science and Technology Policy and spent time at Schmidt Futures.

We discuss…


  
How Renaissance ⁠catalyzed⁠ over $200 million in philanthropic funding in its first year,



  
The goals of the organization and how it has responded to Trump’s S&T funding cuts,



  
What sets Renaissance apart from traditional philanthropic organizations, and lessons for China-focused research foundations,



  
AI applications in education, from tutoring to dyslexia screening,



  
Donor psychology, “portfolio regret,” and how to build trust within a philanthropic network.

            On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with a call between President Trump and Xi, two days of meetings between the U.S. and China in London, and an apparent effort from both sides to de-escalate. Topics include: Retracing steps of the past few weeks, clarity for the U.S. and others on the PRC’s leverage over rare earths, the possibility of the U.S. easing tech export controls, and the lack of trust on both sides in the wake of the past few months. From there: The U.S. has concerns about a Chinese embassy in the UK, the New York Times surfaces a purported FSB document outlining various counterespionage anxieties related to the PRC, and Xi’s daughter joins a dinner with Lukashenko. At the end: People’s Daily publishes an interview with Ren Zhengfei, Xi continues his attempts to curb excess among party members, and Victor Wembanyama visits a Shaolin Monastery.

            <p class="MsoNormal">Any Austin has carved a unique niche for himself on YouTube: analyzing seemingly mundane or otherwise overlooked details in video games with the seriousness of an art critic examining Renaissance sculptures. With millions of viewers hanging on his every word about fluvial flows in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or unemployment rates in the towns of <em>Skyrim</em>, Austin has become what Tyler calls "the very best in the world at the hermeneutics of infrastructure within video games." But Austin's deeper mission is teaching us to think analytically about everything we encounter, and to replace gaming culture's obsession with technical specs and comparative analysis with a deeper aesthetic appreciation that asks simply: what are we looking at, and what does it reveal?</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;"> Tyler and Austin explore the value of the YouTube algorithm, what he notices now about real-world infrastructure, whether he perceives glitches IRL, why AI-generated art is getting less interesting, how the value of historical context differs between artistic forms, an aesthetic abundance agenda for nuclear power, the trajectory of video game quality since the 80s, whether the pace of seminal game releases has slowed, the relative value of commentary to the games themselves, why virtual reality adds nothing meaningful to the gaming experience, what’s wrong with most video game analysis, what to eat in New Orleans, Tyler’s gaming history, and more.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Read a <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/any-austin/">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rOYjgXY-Ts4">full video</a> on the new dedicated CWT channel.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Recorded March 7th, 2025</em></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Help keep the show ad free by <a href="https://mercatus.donorsupport.co/page/podcastgift?utm_source=cwt+podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=shownotes"> donating</a> today!</span></p> <p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong> Other ways to connect</strong></span></p> <ul> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/cowenconvos">X</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en">Instagram</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen">Tyler</a> on X</span></li> <li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a class="c-link" href="https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-stringify-link="https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Sign up for our newsletter</a></span></li> <li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt">Discord</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Email us: <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-expanded="false" data-remove-tab-index="true">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></span></li> <li class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts">here</a>.</span></li> </ul>

        <p>Over the past several decades, the field of robotics has achieved remarkable milestones. Robots have been sent to Mars and to the deepest parts of the ocean. Cynthia Breazeal, a professor at the MIT Media Lab, believes there’s another frontier that robots should enter: our daily lives. As a pioneer in social robotics, Breazeal has devoted her career to developing socially and emotionally intelligent machines — robots that can serve as learning partners in classrooms and even assist in navigating mental health challenges. She joins Pioneers of AI to discuss how social robots can coexist with humans, explore the applications of the robots she’s developing, and explain why AI literacy is more important than ever.</p><p>Learn more about Pioneers of AI: <a href="http://pioneersof.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://pioneersof.ai/</a></p><p>Follow Pioneers of AI on all channels: <a href="https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai</a></p><p>At the center of AI is people, so we want to hear from you!

            <p>Yaroslav Lazor started writing code when he was 10 years old. It took him a while to understand that making a difference in the world wasn't just about writing code - but he has arrived there these days. He is the father of 4 daughters, 2 of which are artists and a couple who are digging into their entrepreneurial roots with running their own lemonade stand. He lives in Los Angeles, and has learned to be a better person through pushing himself as a founder.</p><p>Sergiy Korolov also started coding when he was young, though 4 years later than Yaroslav. He went to a technical university, and as his career in leadership grew, the number of lines of code he contributed to decreased. He is located in Poland, and loves to snowboard in the winter, and bike in the summer. He has 3 kids, and recently started teaching coding to his oldest son.</p><p>Yaroslav & Sergiy were building software for clients, the typical Ukrainian software route. Over time, they realized that building their own products was the best way to make an impact - so much so, that they decided to start building their own.</p><p>This is the creation story of <a href="https://railsware.com/" rel="nofollow">Railsware</a>.</p><p>Sponsors</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.paddle.com/" rel="nofollow">Paddle.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.semasoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">Sema Software</a></li><li><a href="https://www.propelauth.com/" rel="nofollow">PropelAuth</a></li></ul><p>Links</p><ul><li><a href="https://railsware.com/" rel="nofollow">https://railsware.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylazor/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylazor/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiykorolov/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiykorolov/</a></li></ul><br></br><br></br>Our Sponsors:<br></br>* Check out Kinsta: <a href="https://kinsta.com<br/>*">https://kinsta.com<br></br>*</a> Check out Vanta: <a href="https://vanta.com/CODESTORY<br/><br/><br/>Support">https://vanta.com/CODESTORY<br></br><br></br><br></br>Support</a> this podcast at â <a rel="payment" href="https://redcircle.com/code-story/donations">https://redcircle.com/code-story/donations</a><br></br><br></br>Advertising Inquiries: <a href="https://redcircle.com/brands">https://redcircle.com/brands</a><br></br><br></br>Privacy & Opt-Out: <a href="https://redcircle.com/privacy">https://redcircle.com/privacy</a>

            <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enterprise leaders are no longer asking if they should adopt AI — the question is how to do it effectively. In this episode, Emerj Editorial Director Matthew DeMello speaks with James Raybould, SVP and GM of Turing Intelligence at Turing, about what distinguishes successful enterprise AI deployments from stalled pilots. Turing is one of the world’s fastest-growing Artificial Intelligence companies, helping businesses solve their toughest problems with AI—delivering real business results faster, smarter, and at scale—while also working with top AI companies to push the technology forward. Based in San Francisco, Turing was named the #1 most promising B2B company by The Information and is led by AI experts from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Stanford, MIT, and more. James outlines three critical factors that determine whether an AI initiative gets traction: business alignment, workforce readiness, and infrastructure. He explains why companies that start with the technology — instead of the problem — are likely to fall behind, and what it really means to prepare a workforce for AI when automation changes the expectations of work quality and speed.

            Today, we're joined by Jason Corso, co-founder of Voxel51 and professor at the University of Michigan, to explore automated labeling in computer vision. Jason introduces FiftyOne, an open-source platform for visualizing datasets, analyzing models, and improving data quality. We focus on Voxel51’s recent research report, “Zero-shot auto-labeling rivals human performance,” which demonstrates how zero-shot auto-labeling with foundation models can yield to significant cost and time savings compared to traditional human annotation. Jason explains how auto-labels, despite being "noisier" at lower confidence thresholds, can lead to better downstream model performance. We also cover Voxel51's "verified auto-labeling" approach, which utilizes a "stoplight" QA workflow (green, yellow, red light) to minimize human review. Finally, we discuss the challenges of handling decision boundary uncertainty and out-of-domain classes, the differences between synthetic data generation in vision and language domains, and the potential of agentic labeling.

Yet, good MLOps is essential for managing experiments, sharing GPU compute, tracking models, and meeting AI regulations. </p><p><br></p><p>While cloud providers offer MLOps tools, many organizations need flexible, open-source setups that work anywhere—from laptops to supercomputers. Shared setups can boost collaboration, productivity, and compute efficiency.In this session, Jukka introduces an open-source MLOps platform from Silo AI, now packaged for easy deployment across environments. With Git-based workflows and CI/CD automation, users can focus on building models while the platform handles the MLOps.// BioFounder & CTO, 8wave AI | Senior Lecturer, Haaga-Helia University of Applied SciencesJukka Remes has 28+ years of experience in software, machine learning, and infrastructure. Starting with SW dev in the late 1990s and analytics pipelines of fMRI research in early 2000s, he’s worked across deep learning (Nokia Technologies), GPU and cloud infrastructure (IBM), and AI consulting (Silo AI), where he also led MLOps platform development. </p><p><br></p><p>Now a senior lecturer at Haaga-Helia, Jukka continues evolving that open-source MLOps platform with partners like the University of Helsinki. He leads R&D on GenAI and AI-enabled software, and is the founder of 8wave AI, which develops AI Business Operations software for next-gen AI enablement, including regulatory compliance of AI.</p><p><br></p><p>// Related Links</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Open source -based MLOps k8s platform setup originally developed by Jukka's team at Silo AI - free for any use and installable in any environment from laptops to supercomputing: <a href="https://github.com/OSS-MLOPS-PLATFORM/oss-mlops-platform</p><p><br></p><p>Jukka's">https://github.com/OSS-MLOPS-PLATFORM/oss-mlops-platform</p><p><br></p><p>Jukka's</a> new company:<a href="https://8wave.ai</p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~">https://8wave.ai</p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~</a> ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p><br></p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href="https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join">https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join</a> our Slack community [<a href="https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow">https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow</a> us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](<a href="https://x.com/mlopscommunity)">https://x.com/mlopscommunity)</a> or [LinkedIn](<a href="https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)]">https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)]</a> </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [<a href="https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps">https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps</a> Swag/Merch: [<a href="https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect">https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect</a> with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Jukka on LinkedIn: /jukka-remes</p><p><br></p><p>Timestamps:</p><p>[00:00] Jukka's preferred coffee</p><p>[00:39] Open-Source Platform Benefits</p><p>[01:56] Silo MLOps Platform Explanation</p><p>[05:18] AI Model Production Processes</p><p>[10:42] AI Platform Use Cases</p><p>[16:54] Reproducibility in Research Models</p><p>[26:51] Pipeline setup automation</p><p>[33:26] MLOps Adoption Journey</p><p>[38:31] EU AI Act and Open Source</p><p>[41:38] MLOps and 8wave AI</p><p>[45:46] Optimizing Cross-Stakeholder Collaboration</p><p>[52:15] Open Source ML Platform</p><p>[55:06] Wrap up</p>
