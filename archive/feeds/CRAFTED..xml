The way Kevin sees it, podcasts are knowledge. So where most podcast players are, as Kevin calls them, "repurposed music players", Snipd is designed to help you learn. As people listen to episodes, they, or an AI, can save “snips” or interesting moments that they want to remember or share. And the app will also help you review what you've heard, so it reinforces what you've learned.</p><p>A second mindset shift is how Kevin had to retrain his engineering brain to build with generative AI. He no longer thinks in if-then-else statements. Rather, he asks himself: How would an intern do it? And not just one intern, but infinite interns…</p><p>I learned a ton from the way Kevin thinks and builds, and you will too. </p><p>Plus, we discuss the future of podcasting, which looks pretty… weird. You'll talk back to your podcasts, hosts may be synthetic, and shows may not even be designed (at least initially) for human ears.</p><p>Chapters:<br></p><ul><li>(01:30) - Introducing Snipd</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>What <em>is</em> a good money habit in 2025? And how do you actually help someone build one—without boring them, shaming them, or losing them in the first five seconds?</p><p>Chief Product Officer Tim Hong shares how MoneyLion designs for emotion and creates content and products that inspire people to take action. </p><p>MoneyLion is a personal finance platform used by millions of mostly younger Americans who are just getting started with their money, so, as Tim says: “It's actually less about bad habits that we fight. It's about having no habits.”</p><p>Tim also shares how AI could create a truly personalized (1 of 1) financial advisor, why most financial apps are “like going to the DMV”, and how things like open banking and embedded finance can change that…</p><p>—<br>Chapters:<br></p><ul><li>(01:30) - Tim has literally measured how short our attentions spans are at a brainwave startup</li>
<li>(03:49) - What MoneyLion does and why content and storytelling are so important</li>
<li>(08:30) - What even are good money habits today?</li>
<li>(12:00) - How MoneyLion uses AI to create personalized content</li>
<li>(13:40) - "Talking to your money" with AI</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Software is eating the world, right? We've all heard this phrase by now, but inventor and investor Pablos Holman has something important to add: “The world can't eat software.”</p><p>That’s why Pablos focuses on “deep tech”, i.e. how to invent new solutions to real world problems like energy, water, waste, construction, and sanitation. Pablos says we’re still mostly using version 1.0 technology for these fundamental systems, but recent advances, including AI and the ability to prototype and test in software, are enabling incredible innovation in hardware.</p><p>Pablos has worked with Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and more. He's kind of a mad scientist and in this episode we’ll discuss things that sound like science fiction, but that Pablos says are coming soon, such as solar panels in outer space that can beam clean energy down to earth, autonomous cargo ships blown by the wind across the ocean, and tiny nuclear reactors buried a mile underground that power the world above.</p><p>At Deep Future, Pablos is on a mission to solve the world's biggest problems, and he's hoping more people will make the jump that he did from software to hardware and into deep tech, because, as he says, “ all the people who've been building software their entire career, those are the ones who are going to save the world.”</p><p>—</p><p>More on Pablos: </p><ul><li>Deep Future: <a href="https://deepfuture.tech/">https://deepfuture.tech/</a></li><li>Deep Future podcast: <a href="https://deepfuture.tech/podcast-index/">https://deepfuture.tech/podcast-index/</a> </li></ul><p>—</p><p>Support CRAFTED.:</p><ul><li>Sign up for the CRAFTED. newsletter: <a href="https://www.crafted.fm">https://www.crafted.fm</a></li><li>Subscribe to CRAFTED. on your favorite podcast platform</li><li>Share this episode with a friend or colleague!</li></ul>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Deepfakes are getting easier and easier to make. So, how will we be able to believe that what we see and what we hear is real? And what can software makers do to help?</p><p>Sam Gregory is an expert on deepfakes, AI, and trust. He advises governments and tech companies on how they can protect human rights and how we can preserve our shared reality. </p><p>Sam is the executive director of WITNESS, an organization that helps citizens use video to foster social change. WITNESS has trained and supported citizen-journalists since the days of the camcorder through the smartphone era and now into the world of AI. </p><p>We discuss:</p><ul><li>How deepfakes are being used to spread disinformation and erode trust in media.</li><li>How to detect that a piece of media was manipulated and to what degree</li><li>Why audio deepfakes are so pernicious</li><li>How deepfakes mostly did <em>not</em> affect the 2024 US Presidential Election, while <em>cheap</em>fakes were very common</li><li>The surprising ways AI is both helping and harming human rights defenders and journalists</li><li>Why “Prepare, Don’t Panic” is WITNESS’s mantra for addressing AI threats.</li><li>Practical steps software makers can take to design tools that prioritize transparency and ethical use, such as including transparency features in AI-generated content, red teaming to simulate misuse scenarios, thinking beyond Western contexts, and more…</li></ul><p>Chapters:<br></p><ul><li>(00:55) - Deepfakes and the threat they pose human rights and journalism</li>
<li>(03:16) - The 2024 US election and how deepfakes, cheapfakes, and audio clones were used</li>
<li>(07:35) - Why WITNESS. says “Prepare, Don’t Panic” about AI</li>
<li>(11:16) - Recommendation for software builders to prevent — and detect — misuse</li>
<li>(13:45) - How to identify that a piece of media was manipulated by AI</li>
<li>(17:31) - Red Teaming: The scary questions builders should ask as they deploy new products</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Amir Nathoo is reimagining the future of education by building products that put students at the center of their learning experience. As the Founder and CEO of Outschool, Amir has created a marketplace for remote, personalized, interest-based learning that’s challenging traditional K-12. </p><p>In this episode of CRAFTED., we explore how Amir founded and grew Outschool, including the 15x spike in usage during the pandemic. </p><p>Post-pandemic, alternative education and homeschooling continues to rise. As Amir says: “The idea that a single institution could fulfill all of your kids' needs or all of all kids' needs is completely unrealistic…. Mass personalization is needed.” And he sees Outschool as the integration layer for all those teachers, students, and institutions. </p><p>You will learn a ton from Amir’s approach to product development and disruption. </p><p>Key takeaways for product builders: </p><p>1. Start with a Niche Audience, Then Expand</p><p>Amir and Outschool began by targeting a specific group—secular homeschoolers—who had unmet needs in education. By serving this niche well, they achieved product-market fit before scaling to a broader audience. </p><p>2. Co-Creation, FTW<br>Outschool's initial product was shaped through customer co-creation and iterative development, testing small features before scaling them. </p><p>3. Solve Real Problems, But Keep Early Stakes Low<br>While Outschool addressed a critical need (supplemental education), they started with interest-based, "low-stakes" classes.

She’s reported on AI from across the Global South and we’ll hear about the fight over data centers in Chile, how New Zealand’s Maori people are using AI to preserve their indigenous language, and why it’s a problem that AI can speak any language, but can only really be policed in a few.</p><p>Key Moments:</p><p></p><ul><li>(01:51) - - The view of AI from the Global South</li>
<li>(04:08) - - Data centers are thirsty and their benefit is unclear to locals in Chile (and elsewhere)</li>
<li>(09:16) - - GenAI is English-first: Why it’s not as safe in other languages</li>
<li>(12:12) - - Why some activists call AI a new form of “colonialism”</li>
<li>(14:50) - - Indigenous communities innovating with AI</li>
<li>(17:46) - - The case for smaller AI models</li>
<li>(19:40) - - Why open source AI is so important</li>
<li>(25:09) - - AI and the environmental impact: Karen’s reporting on Microsoft’s “hypocrisy”</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Mario Rodriguez is GitHub's Chief Product Officer. And he believes that Copilot and other AI advances will unleash a wave of creativity and enable a billion people to be software developers.</p><p><br></p><p>Mario says the definition of “software developer” will have to change as non-professionals discover that they can make apps, too. And the way they do so will look very different: “It's gonna feel a lot more like how kids play. ​​It's like you create something you play with and you're like, Nope. Then you instruct it again… It’s going to be real time development.”</p><p><br></p><p>On this episode of CRAFTED., Mario gets us excited about the future of software development!</p><p><br></p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>Mario says we’ve lost some of the creativity of the early days of the web; AI is helping bring it back</li><li>With AI, it’s getting much easier (for non-professional developers) to build “micro experiences” and other ephemeral apps that just serve one purpose. </li><li>The craft of product management must change with AI, because building with non-deterministic AI is so tricky to get right</li><li>When building with AI, run your scenario multiple times. Test your prompts repeatedly. You will get different responses each time.

        <![CDATA[<p>Henrik Werdelin is on an AI-fueled mission to launch thousands of startups a year. </p><p>He is the founder of BARK, which went public, and prehype, a studio that has incubated several unicorns. With Audos, Henrik is building AI agents that can coach founders how he would — if he had infinite time to do so. </p><p>And Audos is not just for the cliche founder looking to launch a unicorn… It’s for entrepreneurs of all stripes. With AI making things easier, Henrik expects to see lots more “DonkeyCorns,” i.e. highly profitable businesses operated by just one or two people. </p><p>“DonkeyCorns party like unicorns, but they grind like mules.”</p><p>Check out this episode for lots of practical tips for how you can get more out of AI. Plus, we’ll peer into the weird future we’re building. </p><p>Takeaways from this episode: </p><ul><li>AI enables new businesses to be created, launched, and tested very quickly. Henrik shares how Audos uses AI to help founders focus on their customers, launch, and get customers</li><li>Henrik talks to his AI agents like they’re people: He gives them names and backstories. By doing so, he finds he has a better partner than a bot or Google search would be. </li><li>The more creative you are with prompts, the better the AI will be. e.g., Ask for “ten ideas that will definitely get me fired”</li><li>“Customer-founder fit” is the most important ingredient to Henrik </li><li>Use “signal mining” to prove there is real demand for your product</li><li>“The swipe” proves there is real intent for your product, i.e. get people to pay for it, even if you haven’t built it yet.</li><li>BARK succeeded (it’s gone public) by following its mission (be “Disney for dogs”) not by following its utility (boxes of stuff for pets)</li><li>“Relationship capital” and “humanity” will be more important, as AI continues to excel at technical jobs. </li><li>Take AI seriously right now. And Henrik says senior leaders need to be using it themselves</li><li>It’s weird out there: We discuss the uncanny valley of talking to AI agents (including those that impersonate your dead spouse) </li><li>Rock and roll – Henrik tells the story of his career break: As an intern, he pulled an on-air stunt at MTV that he was sure would get him fired, but instead got him a huge promotion.</li></ul><p>Henrik is the author of <a href="https://hellohenrik.com/book"><em>The Acorn Method: How Companies Get Growing Again</em></a>. And he’s writing a new book, <em>Me, My Customer, and AI</em>.

        <![CDATA[<p>Kelsey Hightower is a legend. He regularly gives live software demos in front of tens of thousands of people, improvising them like it’s jazz.

The platform is used by Notion and lots of other top SaaS companies to personalize user onboarding and more. </p><p>When Customer.io was founded in 2011, there were analytics platforms and there were things you could do with that data, but as the mobile era was taking off – and user onboarding became even more critical – Colin recognized a need for companies to immediately send users messages based on the actions there users had just taken – or (and this was a lot harder to build) the action they had <em>not</em> taken. </p><p>On this episode, we learn from Colin how he built and scaled Customer.io from slideware he pitched to early customers into a company that today boasts top clients and a lofty valuation. </p><p>Plus, tips on how you can improve your own onboarding. </p><p>***</p><p>Key Moments:</p><p>[2:17] How Colin got into product management and early experiences</p><p>[5:00] Becoming head of product at DevPost (fka ChallengePost)</p><p>[7:00] “We were so naive that we just did, we did it.” – Founding Customer.io</p><p>[10:12] Onboarding and more ways companies use customer.io</p><p>[14:43] Why you shouldn’t optimize your onboarding too early</p><p>[17:17] Challenges at customer.io today and their emerging multi-product strategy</p><p>[19:12] AI vs. rules engines; and how Customer.io is using AI now and experimenting</p><p>[22:22] Why triggering a notification when a user has <em>not</em> done something is so much harder than if they have</p><p>[23:55] Infrastructure and constant scaling – one of customer.io’s biggest challenges</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p>CRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management. More than 20 million developers worldwide use Docker's suite of development tools, services and automations to accelerate the delivery of secure applications. </p><p>CRAFTED. is produced by Modern Product Minds, where CRAFTED. host Dan Blumberg and team can help you take a new product from zero to one... and beyond.

And, according to founder and CEO Brandon Kessler, lately there is one overarching directive: “Executives from the top down are saying: `We need to do hackathons to uncover the value of ai.`” Nearly every one of the 1,200 hackathons DevPost powered last year was AI-centric. </p><p>On this episode of CRAFTED., we explore why hackathons are still such a powerful tool, both as public competitions and as internal initiatives. And we hear the founding story of DevPost and why they pivoted from hosting public competitions of all kinds (cooking challenges with Michelle Obama! NYC Big Apps!) to only focus on developers. Plus, how and why DevPost launched a new product that is custom-built for internal company hackathons. </p><p>***</p><p>Key Moments:</p><p>[1:53] DevPost’s mission and why hackathons are still so valuable, especially at this moment with AI</p><p>[6:20] What makes a hackathon successful?</p><p>[8:40] Brandon’s story: he founded and ran a music label for years before seeing the opportunity with challenges</p><p>[11:40] Launching ChallengePost, scaling up and powering all federal competitions under President Obama — and why they eventually changed the name and company focus to DevPost</p><p>[15:46] Launching DevPost for teams: a tool for companies to run internal hackathons</p><p>[19:00] Brandon’s favorite competitions over the years</p><p>[22:00] How hackathons have mirrored the top tech trends: from cloud to XR to blockchain to AI</p><p>[25:18] What’s something that sounds like science fiction now, but that Brandon thinks will be commonplace soon?</p><p>***</p><p>CRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management.

        <![CDATA[<p>When Docker restructured, the company went back to its roots: super-serving developers. CTO Justin Cormack says that’s why the company is <em>developer</em>-obsessed, not customer-obsessed: “We really wanted to focus on the fact that it's the developer who loves Docker. It's the developer who is going to be using Docker every day…” </p><p>Over the past decade, Docker exploded in popularity as companies moved to cloud and adopted software containers as they did... but the company struggled as a business and, five years ago, made massive changes: “When we restructured people were like, `Well, I kind of hope this works, but I doubt it will.`” </p><p>Well, it’s working. Docker is now bigger than ever and growing.</p><p>On this episode of CRAFTED... We'll discuss developer productivity, how Docker continues to build new products to improve it, and why so many organizations are in an awkward phase, with too many responsibilities being put onto the developer. </p><p>We’ll also look beyond the container to new vectors of growth, including helping companies put GenAI to production. </p><p>Plus, Justin will share tips for developers on how they can better communicate their needs. And what CFO-types can do in return: “the one thing they can do is actually listen to the developers!”</p><p>***</p><p>Key Moments:</p><p><br></p><p>[3:13] Why Docker needed to restructure and refocus and why the turnaround has been a success</p><p>[04:52] Why Docker is “developer-obsessed” not “customer-obsessed” </p><p>[6:13] Docker’s explosive growth in its early years: containers, the cloud and microservices</p><p>[08:48] Docker's Successful Restructuring and Product Development</p><p>[11:22] “Shift Left” and why this trend of putting more responsibility onto developers earlier and earlier in development is great, but also can put too much pressure on developers, who need to be supported</p><p>[13:53] How Justin and team prioritize Docker's roadmap </p><p>[16:48] AI: How Docker is helping its client build RAG and other GenAI apps, and the tricky infrastructure needed to support them</p><p>[19:38] Developer productivity and the importance of the inner loop</p><p>[27:01] Developers love their laptops! And why Windows machines have become so popular</p><p>[30:40] How to talk so your CFO will listen and the rise of business-focused engineers</p><p>***</p><p>CRAFTED. is brought to you in partnership with Docker, which helps developers build, share, run and verify applications anywhere – without environment confirmation or management. More than 20 million developers worldwide use Docker's suite of development tools, services and automations to accelerate the delivery of secure applications. </p><p>CRAFTED. is produced by Modern Product Minds, where CRAFTED. host Dan Blumberg and team can help you take a new product from zero to one... and beyond.

        <![CDATA[“You have to invest into change. You cannot invest into stasis.<p>Daniel Kimerling has a keen eye for the trends, technologies, and cultural shifts that are going to be big. A decade ago, he took an insight – that developers needed powerful tool so they could embed banking services into their apps – and launched Standard Treasury, the very first banking-as-a-service (BaaS) startup.

        <![CDATA[<p>** Please take this three-minute survey to help us create more great Crafted episodes. http://tinyurl.com/craftedsurvey **</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Last week, on Thursday January 18th at 4:49pm Eastern, a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on its way to the International Space Station. On board are 4 astronauts from Axiom Space, a private company that’s building a brand new space station. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>To celebrate the successful launch of AX-3, we’re bringing you one of our favorite episodes from the Crafted archives: an interview with Axiom’s Director of In-Space Manufacturing. Keep listening to find out why Axiom is building a commercial space station — and why microgravity is such a special environment for building things like computer chips and for doing biological research that could lead to new cancer treatments.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>“When we talk about future cities in space, it seems like they're really far away. The truth is, it's happening right now. We're building those.” That’s the mind-blowing reality that Jana Stoudemire works in everyday at Axiom Space, a leading space infrastructure developer based in Texas. Axiom is building a successor to the International Space Station and developing commercial opportunities in orbit that go way beyond satellites. Central to all this is the unique environment of microgravity, which allows you to do things that just can’t be done on earth.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>On this episode, Jana takes us to the final frontier, and shares Axiom's plans for advanced biomedical research, space-made semiconductors that could enable quantum computing, and what this means for future scientific advances. She’ll also get into the challenges of building a state-of-the-art lab that will orbit around the earth, from the equipment and personnel, to where does that exercise bike go?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This is Crafted from Artium: a show about great products, and the people who make them. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Crafted is sponsored by Artium, which helps startups and enterprises build incredible products, recruit high-performing teams, and achieve the culture of craft needed to build great software for years to come.

        <![CDATA[<p>  “We haven’t invented a new way to work out since the ancient Greeks. With electro muscular stimulation, we're breaking that.” Invention is a big part of everything Bjoern Woltermann did at Katalyst to bring electro muscular stimulation, or EMS, to the US market – and to US homes. EMS workouts have been around for decades, but typically only in a physical therapy context. With Katalyst, you wear a suit that triggers your muscles while you work out, promising the equivalent of a 2-hour workout in only 20 minutes, and with less injury risk than a traditional workout. But to make this suit work at home, Bjoern and his team needed to invent everything from special sensors to custom textiles.</p><p> On this episode, we'll hear how a long-time back problem led Bjoern to discover EMS training in Germany, and realize the untouched opportunity for bringing it to the US. And we’ll go deep to understand how Bjoern and his team created a fascinating mix of hardware, software, sensors, textiles, and content and then stitched it all together.</p><p> This is <em>Crafted </em>from Artium: a show about great products, and the people who make them.  At Artium, we help startups and enterprises build incredible products, recruit high-performing teams, and achieve the culture of craft they need to build great software long after we’re gone.

That was how Sonali Zaveri felt about working with Ideas42 Ventures, after learning about the first cohort of entrepreneurs she would advise. Ideas42 Ventures is a venture studio that aims to solve massive social problems by helping founders with lived experience launch companies that address issues like poverty and inequality. The founders are selected based on their potential, their passion, and their lived experience – and unlike other venture studios they don’t necessarily need a tech background, nor even a product idea on day one. </p><p>On this episode of <em>Crafted</em>, Design and Operations Lead Sonali Zaveri shares how she coaches these founders, as well as why entrepreneurship is such a “privileged sport” — and what she’s doing about that.
