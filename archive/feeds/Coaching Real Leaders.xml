(from HBR’s Women at Work)</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2022/09/how-can-i-get-along-with-my-difficult-boss-from-hbrs-women-at-work</link><description>This episode is part of a new special series from HBR’s Women at Work, hosted by Amy Gallo – an expert in workplace dynamics. Each episode offers tactics for dealing with “difficult” people at work. Every workplace has them, but what if we had better tools and approaches to improve our interactions with those colleagues? In this episode, Amy helps a leader whose boss keeps rejecting any changes she recommends. By the end of the conversation, she has the advice she needs to communicate her proposals in a way that will get approval and feel less stress when interacting with her boss.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every workplace has &#8220;difficult&#8221; people. No matter how hard we try, getting along with these colleagues is tough. But if we had better tools and approaches, could we not just improve our interactions with them but maybe even turn them into allies?</p>
<p>This episode is an exclusive introduction to a new special podcast series from HBR&#8217;s <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/podcast-women-at-work">Women at Work</a>. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2022/09/introducing-getting-along">&#8220;Getting Along&#8221;</a> and is in Women at Work&#8217;s feed this September.</p>
<p>Each of the four episodes is hosted by Women at Work&#8217;s Amy Gallo. In this one, Amy speaks with a leader who is struggling in her new role because her boss (the company&#8217;s founder and CEO) keeps rejecting any changes she recommends. Amy helps her figure out how to communicate her proposals in a way that will get the approval she needs. It&#8217;s a useful conversation for anyone who needs to manage up more effectively and wants to feel less stress dealing with a challenging boss.</p>
<p>Amy is a sought-after expert in workplace dynamics, conflict, and communication and has helped thousands of leaders learn how to handle conflict at work. The series offers targeted tactics for dealing with tough coworkers, based on Amy&#8217;s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Along-Anyone-Difficult-People/dp/1647821061/"><em>Getting Along: How to Work with Anyone (Even Difficult People)</em></a>, through one-on-one coaching sessions with guests who are dealing with difficult colleagues.</p>
