      <title>Making the Most of the S&amp;T Dark Age</title>
      <description>Renaissance Philanthropy — in my opinion, the most exciting S&amp;T philanthropic venture in the US — is getting a one-year check-in. Kumar Garg first appeared on the show right before I went on paternity leave, and now we’re back for round two. Before founding Renaissance Philanthropy, Kumar worked in the Obama Office of Science and Technology Policy and spent time at Schmidt Futures.

We discuss…


  
How Renaissance ⁠catalyzed⁠ over $200 million in philanthropic funding in its first year,



  
The goals of the organization and how it has responded to Trump’s S&amp;T funding cuts,



  
What sets Renaissance apart from traditional philanthropic organizations, and lessons for China-focused research foundations,



  
AI applications in education, from tutoring to dyslexia screening,



  
Donor psychology, “portfolio regret,” and how to build trust within a philanthropic network.

      <title>MAGA-Mao Connections with Orville Schell</title>
      <description>What can Mao Zedong teach us about Donald Trump?

To find out, ChinaTalk interviewed the legendary sinologist Orville Schell, who visited China during the Cultural Revolution and is currently at the Asia Society.

We discuss…


  
Mao Zedong’s psychology and political style,



  
Similarities and differences between Mao and Trump,



  
How Mao-era traumas reverberate in modern China, including how the Cultural Revolution has influenced the Xi family, 



  
How Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping survived the Cultural Revolution, and which of their tactics could be useful in modern America,



  
What civil society can do to defend democracy over the next four years.




Co-hosting is Alexander Boyd, associate editor at China Books Review and former ChinaTalk intern.

      <title>Why the US Needs a Department of Competitiveness</title>
      <description>What does the future of industrial policy in America look like, and what state capacity investments are needed to get there? How does China factor into the future of the U.S. semiconductor industry? And what do government affairs offices at large technology firms actually do? To explore these questions, we’re concluding our CSIS Chip Chat series with Bruce Andrews. Bruce has had a long career on Capitol Hill, led government affairs for Ford, served as Deputy Secretary of Commerce under President Obama, and most recently headed government affairs at Intel. He’s now a fellow at CSIS.

We discuss…


  
The decline of bipartisanship and how to bring expertise back to Capitol Hill,



  
The case for a new “Department of Competitiveness” 



  
Industry’s role in policymaking and what it took to get semiconductor manufacturers on board with the CHIPS Act,



  
Why Silicon Valley suddenly became interested in politics,



  
How to optimize industrial policy in a stick-focused political environment.

      <title>Ezra, Derek, and Dan Wang on Abundance and China</title>
      <description>Does anybody really understand China? Could America pursue an abundance agenda without the threat of the PRC? Can podcasters change the world? 

To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, who need no introduction, as well as Dan Wang, who has written beautiful annual letters and is back in the US as a research fellow at Kotkin’s Hoover History Lab. He has an excellent book called Breakneck coming out this August, but we’re saving that show for a little later this year. 

Today, our conversation covers…


  
The use of China as a rhetorical device in US domestic discourse,



  
Oversimplified aspects of Chinese development, and why the bipartisan consensus surrounding Beijing might fail to produce a coherent strategy,



  
The abundance agenda and technocratic vs prophetic strategies for policy change,



  
How to conceptualize political actors complexly, including unions, corporations, and environmental groups,



  
The value of podcasting and strategies for positively impacting the modern media environment.

      <title>China's Nuclear Shadow</title>
      <description>Can China use military force to achieve its political goals, without triggering nuclear war? To find out, ChinaTalk interviewed Fiona Cunningham, a professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the new book, Under the Nuclear Shadow: China’s Information-Age Weapons in International Security.

Co-hosting today is Michael Horowitz, another Penn professor who served in Biden’s Department of Defense.

We discuss…


  
How to use open source PLA documents to conduct deep research,



  
The evolution of Chinese defense strategy, including the impact of the third Taiwan Strait crisis,



  
Nuclear modernization and China’s “no first use” policy,



  
How the PLA makes decisions, including why they chose to develop cyber capabilities, anti-satellite weapons, and hypersonic missiles over proposed alternatives.

      <title>America's R&amp;D Reckoning</title>
      <description>What has happened in the past 100 days to America’s science and technology ecosystem? What are China's ambitions and how is the government trying to take advantage of American uncertainty? And what can we learn from China's war mobilization exercises?

To explore these questions, we're joined by Divyansh Kaushik and Alex Rubin, who both work at Beacon Global Strategies. Divyansh holds an AI PhD from Carnegie Mellon, and Alex spent the past decade at the CIA focusing on China and emerging technologies.

We discuss…


  
The Historical origins of the US R&amp;D model, and the division of labor between universities, government, and industry,



  
How budget cuts will impact the NSF, NIH, NIST, and DoD basic research,



  
Why and how China attempts to emulate US research institutions,



  
What a leaked wargame exercise from Guangdong province can tell us about China’s grand strategy,



  
How institutions like ChinaTalk can complement the IC with fresh, independent research.

      <title>Will Everyone Get Nukes Now?</title>
      <description>What is Trump doing to extended deterrence? 

I got Polymarket to create a market on whether a US ally will acquire nuclear weapons in 2025. It’s currently trading at 8%. Are we buyers or sellers?

To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Vipin Narang, professor at MIT, who served as Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense responsible for nuclear deterrence policy during the Biden administration; Pranay Vaddi, a senior fellow at the Center for Nuclear Security Policy at MIT who worked on arms control and non-proliferation on Biden’s National Security Council; and Junichi Fukuda, senior research fellow at Tokyo’s Sasakawa Peace Foundation.

We get into…


  
The historical development of the American nuclear umbrella, including the “software” and “hardware” components of deterrence,



  
The probability that an American ally will proliferate by 2030, and which countries are the most likely candidates,



  
Why France proliferated despite US objections,



  
How the world might respond to nuclear ambitions from Poland, Japan, or Saudi Arabia,



  
China’s nuclear modernization and deterrence strategies for a multi-polar world.

      <title>Allied Scale: Rush Doshi on US-China Net Assessment</title>
      <description>Rush Doshi (CFR, Biden NSC, author of the excellent The Long Game) and I run through the US-China tale of the tape. The future of America's relationship with its allies may be the key hinge variable for whether this century turns out to be China's to define. Do give this one a listen. Especially if you're JD Vance!

      <title>Chips: Liberated? Trump’s Semis Tariff Gambit</title>
      <description>Bill Reinsch of CSIS and the Trade Guys podcast with Jay Goldberg of Digits and Dollars and the Circuit podcast join to dicuss Trump's tariff impact on semis on another CSIS-ChinaTalk Chip Chat!

Bill lays out the four clashing instincts driving policy in MAGA 2.0: revenge for decades of perceived slights, a bargaining bluff to coerce concessions, a fast‑cash revenue grab, and a fantasy of instant on‑shore fab construction. 

Jay walks through the on‑the‑ground fallout: chip designers worrying about losing China sales, GPU‑specific duties warping supply chains, and a loophole that lets boards assembled in Mexico skate by. 

We explore how blanket tariffs could accelerate China’s ascent in analog and trailing‑edge chips, undermine Biden‑era “ally‑first” export‑control diplomacy, and leave Commerce’s BIS badly under‑resourced to enforce the rules. 

We also get into whether allies will sign up for Washington’s crusade after being slapped themselves, and whether Nvidia, Intel, and Tesla are “too important to punish.” 

Outtro Music: Well Get It, Tommy Dorsey

      <title>Breaking Beijing: Military Competition with Tony Stark</title>
      <description>Does America still have what it takes to stand up to China? Does short-term military readiness trade off with long-term strategy? What does the US need to do today to stay competitive for the rest of the century? 
“Tony Stark” is the author of Breaking Beijing, a Substack examining the military dimensions of US-China competition. Tony’s Substack goes deep on subjects you didn’t know you needed to understand, like Arctic policy, and takes a refreshing step back to look at great power competition holistically. Tony is also the author of Ex Supra, a sci-fi thriller about a near-future US-China war. 
Today, we discuss…

What it will take to win the 21st century, and what America needs to prioritize in the short, medium, and long term,

Why investing in education, basic science research, and foreign aid pay dividends in military readiness,

Why Washington is short on coherent China strategy,

Taiwan’s impact on global nonproliferation efforts,

How AI could change warfare, even if AGI can’t be considered a “wonder weapon.”


Outro music: Cmon - Fred Again (YouTube link)

      <title>GreatDepressionTalk with SemiAnalysis and Asianometry</title>
      <description>Doug gives his "we're heading for the end of the dollar-based world order" take. 
Dylan has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to macro or politics.
We fail to arrive at the 2011 Obama-Boehner deal.
I had a fever during the recording so don't really talk.

      <description>Welcome to part two of our series on Cold War history with Sergey Radchenko. Here’s part one.

In today’s interview, we discuss…

Khrushchev’s removal from power and the transition to the Brezhnev era,

How the USSR and China managed their relationships with Vietnam,

Sino-Soviet border conflicts, Brezhnev’s negative feelings toward China, and Nixon’s rapprochement,

Watergate and the inability of China or the USSR to understand American politics

Why the Soviets decided to invade Afghanistan,

Reagan’s approach to negotiations and his relationship with Gorbachev,

How to manage the containment paradox and unknown adversary motives when competing with China and Russia today.

      <title>The Soviets' Bid for Global Power</title>
      <description>Sergey Radchenko’s book, To Run the World: The Kremlin’s Bid for Global Power, is a masterwork! In my mind, it’s in pole position for best book of 2025. Sergey takes you into the mind of Soviet and Chinese leaders as they wrestle for global power and recognition, leaving you amused, inspired, and horrified by the small-mindedness of the people who had the power to start World War III.
We get amazing vignettes like Liu Shaoqi making fun of the Americans for eating ice cream in trenches, Khrushchev pinning red stars on Eisenhower’s grandkids, and Brezhnev and Andropov offering to dig up dirt on senators to help save Nixon from Watergate.
Sergey earns your trust in this book, acknowledging what we can and can’t know. He leaves you with a new lens to understand the Cold War and the new US-China rivalry — namely, the overwhelming preoccupation with global prestige by Cold War leaders.
In this interview, we discuss…

Why legitimacy matters in international politics,

Stalin’s colonial ambitions and Truman’s strategy of containment,

Sino-Soviet relations during the Stalin era and beyond,

The history of nuclear blackmail, starting with the 1956 Suez crisis,

Why Khrushchev couldn’t save the Soviet economy.

      <title>Building Compute in America</title>
      <description>Despite leading the world in AI innovation, there’s no guarantee that America will rise to meet the challenge of AI infrastructure. Specifically, the key technological barrier for data center construction within the next 5 years is new power capacity.
To discuss policy solutions, ChinaTalk interviewed Ben Della Rocca, who helped write the AI infrastructure executive order and formerly served as director for technology and national security on Biden’s NSC, as well as Arnab Datta, director at IFP and managing director at Employ America, and Tim Fist, a director at IFP. Arnab and Tim just published a fantastic three-part series exploring the policy changes needed to ensure that AGI is invented in the USA and deployed through American data centers.
In today’s interview, we discuss…

The need for new power generation driven by ballooning demand for compute,

The impact of the January 2025 executive order on AI infrastructure,

Which energy technologies can (and can’t) power gigawatt-scale AI training facilities (and why Jordan is all-in on GEOTHERMAL),

Challenges for financing moonshot green power ideas and the role of government action,

The failure of the market to prioritize AI lab security, and what can be done to fend off threats from adversaries and non-state actors.

      <title>Manus: A DeepSeek Moment?</title>
      <description>A Wuhan-developed AI agent went viral this weekend. Guests Rohit Krishnan of the substack Strange Loop Canon, Shawn Wang of Latent Space, and Dean Ball of Mercatus and Hyperdimensional join us to discuss.
We get into

What Manus is and isn't

What Manus tells us about the broader AI ecosystem's ability to produce products we actually want to use

The political economy and liability issues that AI agents will engender

      <title>EMERGENCY POD: Trump's Pivot to Putin, AGI + The Future of Warfare</title>
      <description>Note: This episode was recorded Wednesday February 26th, two days before Zelenskyy's press conference with J.D. Vance and Trump in the White House.
Shashank Joshi (Defence Editor at The Economist) and Michael Horowitz (Biden's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Development and Emerging Capabilities, now back at Penn) come on the show to discuss:


Ukraine's Chances on the Battlefield: We revisit J.D. Vance's tweet war with Shashank where he claims Ukraine is fated to lose, highlighting how war is nonlinear and dependent on political cohesion, economic strength, and defense industrial capacity beyond just manpower.


Trump's Pivot to Putin: We try to think through what Trump is doing with Ukraine and Russia at the strategic level and what the long term and second order consequences are.


AI and the Future of Warfare: We discuss of how AGI would transform warfare, with Horowitz suggesting progress will be incremental rather than revolutionary, emphasizing government adoption challenges over 0 to 1 technical breakthroughs.


"Precise Mass" in Combat: Ukrainian forces have demonstrated how AI-guided drones achieving 80%+ hit rates have changed battlefield dynamics, introducing the concept of "precise mass" - lower-cost precision systems deployed at scale across domains including air, land, and sea. See Mike's Foreign Affairs piece on the topic here: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/battles-precise-mass-technology-war-horowitz


Defense Innovation Challenges: Western bureaucratic processes severely impede military innovation, with Horowitz noting that reprogramming just 0.05% of the defense budget required over 40 congressional briefings, contrasting with Ukraine's wartime innovation speed and calling for acquisition reform.

      <title>Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare</title>
      <description>Can sanctions really work? What lessons can we draw from US sanctions on Iran, Russia, and China in the 21st century?
To find out, we interviewed Eddie Fishman, a former civil servant at the Department of State and an Adjunct Professor at Columbia. His new book, Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare, is a gripping history of the past 20 years of American sanctions policy.
In this show, we’ll talk about…

The evolution of U.S. sanctions policy, from Iraq and Cuba to Iran and Russia,

How Reagan’s deal with the Saudis turned the dollar into an economic chokepoint,

The incredible success of sanctions against Iran, and how that playbook could have been used to punish Russia,

Historical lessons in enforcement that are relevant for export controls on China today,

The role of great civil servants like Stuart Levey, Daleep Singh, Victoria Nuland, and Matt Pottinger in building state power,

Institutional challenges for economic warfare and the consequences of failure to reform,

Strategies for writing groundbreaking books about modern history.


Outro music: 1970s Iranian Psychadelic Rock, Gole Yakhe by Kourosh Yaghmaei https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmhqVPXOKo4

      <title>Innovation Emergency: The Role of IP</title>
      <description>How do patents influence emerging technology innovation? How far could AI and DOGE push our current IP regime? Does it matter that China issues way more patents than the US does?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed ​​Andrei Iancu, who served as the director of the US Patent Office under the first Trump administration. Andrei has degrees in aerospace and mechanical engineering, and worked at the legendary Hughes Aircraft Company before going to law school. He is currently in private practice at Sullivan and Cromwell.
Co-hosting today is ChinaTalk editor and second year law student at Duke, Nicholas Welch.
We get into…

The mounting evidence that China's patent system now dominates America’s, and whether these indicators constitute an emergency in the innovation ecosystem,

Why some US companies now prefer Chinese courts for patent enforcement,

The fundamental tension between private rights of inventors and public access to innovations,

What congressional inaction on patent eligibility means for AI innovation, and the bills that congress could pass to immediately jumpstart emerging tech investment,

What the current administration could do to help USPTO juice the economy,

Controversy surrounding the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), and whether DOGE could put PTAB on the chopping block,

How Trump will approach patent law and intellectual property rights, including perspectives on appointments and potential reforms.

Thanks to CSIS for partnering with us to bring you this episode, the first in a three-episode CSIS Chip Chat series.

      <title>China's Great Power Wars: Lessons from Imperial History for Today</title>
      <description>How has Chinese hegemony shaped power relations in East Asia? Why did imperial China conquer Tibet and Xinjiang but not Vietnam or Korea? Can learning from history help maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait?
Today’s interview begins with one shocking truth — while medieval Europe suffered under near-constant war, East Asia’s Middle Ages were defined by great power peace.
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Professor David C. Kang, director of the Korean Studies Institute at USC and co-author of Beyond Power Transitions: The Lessons of East Asian History and the Future of U.S.-China Relations.
We discuss…

How East Asian nations managed to peacefully coexist for centuries,

Why lessons from European history don’t always apply in non-European contexts, 

Why wars begin and how they can be avoided,

How to interpret outbreaks of violence in Asia — including conflicts with the Mongols, China’s meddling in Vietnam, and Japan’s early attempts at empire,

State behaviors that cannot be explained by power transition theory alone,

Whether the Thucydides trap makes U.S.-China war inevitable,

Old school methods for managing cross-strait relations.


Co-hosting today is Ilari Mäkelä of the On Humans podcast.
Outro music: 荒城の月 "The Moon over the Ruined Castle" by 滝廉太郎 Rentarō Taki (Youtube link)

      <title>Anthropic's Dario Amodei on AI Competition</title>
      <description>Dario Amodei is the CEO of Anthropic. In today’s interview, we discuss…

Whether an AI innovation race is inevitable between the US and China,

How the US should update export controls in light of DeepSeek’s R1 release,

DeepSeek’s willingness to generate information about bioweapons,

Technical defenses against model distillation and AI espionage,

How advanced AI could eventually impact democracy,

Whether there is tension between export controls and the belief that AI will broadly increase human flourishing.

      <title>DeepSeek: What It Means and What Happens Next</title>
      <description>Kevin Xu of Interconnected and Interconnected Capital and I knock it out of the park with a roundup episode exploring:

What DeepSeek does and doesn't illustrate about Chinese innovation

Tensions between open-source cosmopolitanism and nationalism built into DeepSeek and the broader Chinese tech community

DeepSeek's organizational and talent management strategy, parallels to OpenAI, and what the fame will mean for the firm and Chinese AI policy

What DeepSeek should and may mean for the future of export controls and broader US innovation policy

      <title>Patents and National Power</title>
      <description>What makes some countries more innovative than others? What role do intellectual property rights play in building national power? Does Elon Musk really give competitors free access to Tesla’s patents?
To find out, ChinaTalk interviewed Adam Mossoff, professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.
We discuss…

How the patent system has shaped American society since independence,

The extent to which patent policy caused the great divergence between the West and China,

Whether Elon’s misunderstanding of patents will become the dominant attitude of the second Trump administration,

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and other threats to the U.S. innovation ecosystem,

How to reconcile China’s IP theft with its robust domestic patent law,

What the U.S. can do to facilitate innovation while competing with China in emerging technology.


Outro Songs from the American Revolution:
Liberty Song (Arthur F. Schrader rendition), and the Tory retort, Come Shake Your Dull Noodles (Arthur F. Schrader rendition)
Thanks to the Innovation Alliance for sponsoring this episode. The Innovation Alliance is a coalition of research and development-based technology companies representing innovators, patent owners, and stakeholders who believe in the critical importance of maintaining a strong patent system that supports innovative enterprises of all sizes.

      <title>Noah Smith: Trump 2.0's Impact on Asia + The New Tech Right</title>
      <description>​​Our guest today is economist Noah Smith, who made time for an in-person interview during his recent trip to Taiwan. He runs the Noahpinion substack and is the author of an upcoming book on the revival of the Japanese economy. 
We discuss…

The goals of Silicon Valley's pro-Trump constituency, from deregulation, to tariffs, to China policy,

Whether Elon is standing up for Taiwan behind closed doors,

Whether Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Poland need their own nuclear weapons,

How Taiwan could bargain for independence with China’s leaders post-Xi,

National health insurance as a potential solution to China’s aggregate demand problem,

A Georgist perspective on China’s real estate problem,

Why China’s demographic issues are overstated, 

Recommendations for Taiwan’s economic development.


To hear more of Noah's musings, check out Econ 102, a podcast by Turpentine.

      <title>Amb. Burns Reflects from Beijing</title>
      <description>Can diplomatic charisma prevent crises from escalating? Does the CCP feel conflicted about aligning with the likes of Iran and North Korea? What’s the use of communicating during a great power competition?
To find out, ChinaTalk interviewed R. Nicholas Burns, Biden’s Ambassador to China, whose diplomatic career spans 35 years and 8 countries.
We discuss…

Kissinger’s experience negotiating with the CCP,

Why China’s negotiating tactics are so different from those of the Soviet Union,

How European allies are helping to push back against Chinese aggression,

Great power responsibilities, and whether Chinese leaders truly appreciate the reputational costs of helping the Russians and the Houthis,

Biden’s victories with new partners in the Pacific,

How diplomats express consequences and draw red lines during international crises,

Areas of mutual interest where the U.S. and China can still engage productively,

The importance of specialists in the Foreign Service. 


Outro music: 
Óró Mo Bháidín - Mary O’Hara
Auld Lang Syne - Rendition by The Irish Rovers, originally written by Robert Burns

      <title>Tech Bros vs MAGA, Immigration, and Whether Tiger Parents Will Win Cold War 2.0</title>
      <description>To discuss the Christmas Day MAGA civil war over H1Bs and the future of US immigration policy, ChinaTalk interviewed Divyansh Kaushik, a computer science PhD and vice president of Beacon Global Strategies. 
We get into…

Pro-immigrant attitudes among Trump’s allies in Silicon Valley

Creative political maneuvering that could make high-skill immigration reform a reality

Whether Vivek is right about American culture aspiring to normalcy

Other areas where Elon and the tech right might spend their political influence 

How nativist backlash could influence Trump’s agenda

Why India has yet to produce an influential, home-grown AI lab


Special thanks to Mani Subramani, Gauri Subramani, and our anonymous contributor who grew up in China for sharing their reflections on immigrant parenting. 
Outro song: Kishore Kumar, Rote Hue Aate Hai Sab https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e18Pgofqpnc

And a whole lot more this was a great episode!

      <title>Chinese Pop Culture in 2024</title>
      <description>We’ll be getting into the biggest tv show of 2024, a celebrity road trip “will they or won’t they divorce” show which is just as big of a hot mess as it sounds like, rigged nationalist singing competitions, megacorp boy idol capitalism corrupting something as seemingly innocent as a farming reality show, and xinjiang-set tv hit drama.
Our guest today is Em who writes Active Faults, one of my favorite substacks that explores the China’s entertainment industry and celebrity fandom. It is a consistently dark read but one of my favorite discoveries this year. https://activefaults.substack.com/

      <title>EMERGENCY POD: Biden's Final Export Controls Misfire?</title>
      <description>Commerce released its much-anticipated chip export-control updates yesterday, December 2. But today's guests are unimpressed.
But are we right to have hoped for more? To discuss, I’m joined by Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis and Greg Allen from CSIS.
A disclaimer: We recorded this yesterday the same day the regs were released, and given their complexity our takes are inevitably provisional.
We get into:

What’s in the new controls: high bandwidth memory, FDPR, and the Entity List.

Why key assumptions in Biden’s approach to export controls limited

How China’s stockpiling spree may have already rendered these new rules partially obsolete, and what policymakers can do about that going forward.

The law-enforcement approach vs. the counterintelligence approach, and whether export controls should be a foreign-policy tool or simply a law-enforcement activity.

How the new chip controls are like removing puzzle pieces just one at a time — and why that’s exactly what China wants.

The “America First” rationale for domestic chip production.

Why the Democrats’ regulatory design philosophy has favored massive complexity to the detriment of enforcement — and what the Trump administration might do differently going forward.

      <title>Makers of Modern Strategy with Hal Brands</title>
      <description>Few books have influenced me as much as the Makers of Modern Strategy series. The three volumes (published in 1942, 1986, and 2023) are indispensable to understanding statecraft, leadership, and the evolution of warfare across millennia.
The New Makers of Modern Strategy (2023) is a thousand pages long and analyzes strategy from ancient Greece to the Congo.
The man behind this behemoth collection is Hal Brands, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a returning ChinaTalk guest.
In our conversation, we discuss: 

The process for compiling such an ambitious collection of essays;

Unique insights and new topics covered in the 2023 edition, including Tecumseh, Kabila in the Congo, and Strategies of Equilibrium in 17th Century France;

Advice for reading the book effectively;

Revolutions in military affairs, from the atom bomb to quantum computers. 


For reference, you can compare the content of the three volumes with this spreadsheet, courtesy of Nicholas Welch.

      <title>Data Wars and the DOJ</title>
      <description>To discuss the Department of Justice’s new proposed rule on data security, we interviewed two brilliant guests from the ChinaTalk Hall of Fame — DOJ National Security Division attorneys Lee Licata and Devin DeBacker.
Before DOJ, Lee was an attorney at DHS and then CBP, while Devin was a partner at Kirkland &amp; Ellis and then worked with the Office of White House Counsel. Today we’ll be discussing the DOJ’s new proposed rule on data security. 
We get into…

DOJ’s plan to protect your data from foreign adversaries,

How public comments have shaped the proposed rule since the last time we interviewed Lee and Devin,

DOJ’s tools for enforcing corporate compliance,

The differences between data security regulations, privacy laws, and export controls,

Why some public comments get accepted and some get rejected,

The DOJ playbook for assembling a dream team of talented bureaucrats.


Thanks to Nicholas Welch for hosting this interview!

      <title>Music Hour! Chinese Shoegaze: An Introduction</title>
      <description>ChinaTalk columnist Alexa Pan and Jake Newby of the China music substack Concrete Avalanche (https://jakenewby.substack.com/)
No election content whatsoever!
1. 'Hohhot Aquarium' - NarrowLaneAngel 窄巷天使
One of the stand-out acts from the Kind of Shoegaze Vol. 1 compilation focused on young Chinese bands that was released at the start of the year, NarrowLaneAngel formed in Inner Mongolia in 2023. In August of that year, they released an eponymous debut EP.

2. 'Limpid' - Forsaken Autumn
Based in Shanghai, Forsaken Autumn have been together since 2011, propelled by the talents of britlulu (who also founded the East Asia Shoegaze Festival) and singer Ecke Wu. Released at the tail-end of 2015, Forsaken Autumn’s record Whenere — dubbed “the Chinese Loveless” by one commenter on Bandcamp — is a classic in Chinese shoegaze circles.

3. 'Nostalgia' - Summer Daze
Founded in 2021, Summer Daze are another band who featured on the Kind of Shoegaze compilation series from Amemoyo. After a couple of early EPs, they've put out four new singles over the course of this year.

4. 'Firework' - The White Tulips
Xiamen music scene stalwart Chen Zhenchao (also known as Soda) has moved away from shoegaze into surf-rock and dream- and city-pop territory with his more recent projects, but in 2015 he and his band The White Tulips delivered the decidedly shoegazey Fondle. It’s re-release on vinyl in 2021 was a nod to its status as a Chinese shoegaze classic.

5. 'Float' - Chocland.doc 巧克力文件岛
Hebei five piece Chocland.doc apparently first came together at a former residence of Eileen Chang, but are seemingly yet to write a song based on Lust, Caution or any of her other novels. "Of course, the name of the band has no meaning," they say, "what you understand is what you understand."

6. 'Is your dream still out-focus' - Lunacid
Another one of China's newer shoegaze acts, Lunacid were formed in 2023. The trio hail from Changsha and also featured on the Kind of Shoegaze compilation series.

7. '迷航' ('Dazedtrek') - 哲学思潮 (Philosophy Currents)
Formed just last year, 哲学思潮 hail from Nanning in Guangxi province, near the border with Vietnam. Their debut album Dazedtrek was recently made available on Bandcamp. 

8. 'Detached' - The Numen
Shanghai-based quartet The Numen met on arts review platform Douban and have pursued a shared love of shoegaze and indie-rock since the summer of 2023. They namecheck shoegaze greats such as My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields among their influences. 

9. 'Cat Tenant (Summer)' - Baby Formula
Formed by “three boring people with no expectations for the unknown journey ahead”, Beijing band Baby Formula came seemingly out of nowhere, dropped an impressive eponymous debut album in the autumn of 2013, and then promptly disappeared again. Still, their music continues to resonate over a decade later.

10. 'star' - Dear Eloise
As frontman for long-running band PK14, Yang Haisong is one of the godfathers of Chinese post-punk. Yet he’s also played a pivotal role in bringing more experimental, noisy, and yes, shoegazey sounds to the fore. Formed in 2007 with his wife (and one-time PK14 bassist) Sun Xia, Dear Eloise have released a string of atmospheric records over the years and remain an influential act in China.

      <title>Soviet Ruins and China's Future</title>
      <description>Why did the Soviet Union collapse? Which lessons from Cold War history are relevant for China’s future?
To discuss the successes, failures, and strategies of Soviet leaders, ChinaTalk interviewed Yakov Feygin. Feygin is the author of Building a Ruin: The Cold War Politics of Soviet Economic Reform, which examines how various Soviet leaders, institutions, and economists attempted to boost Soviet growth and national power. 
Co-hosting today is Jon Sine, writer of the Cogitations substack.
We discuss:

The strengths and limitations of the Stalinist economic model,

Khrushchev’s shift to “peaceful competition” with capitalism,

Alternative policy paths that could have saved the Soviet Union,

How technological optimism shaped Soviet reform efforts, inspiring the CCP in the process,

Parallels between the institutions of the Soviet Union and those of contemporary China,

The battle between political scientists and historians when analyzing the political economy of authoritarian states.

Outro music: Building a Ruin - Skyclad (Youtube link)
Links to all the books and papers referenced in this show are available on the ChinaTalk substack.

      <title>Imperial Legacy Part 2: 1949 to Xi's Death</title>
      <description>Welcome back to part two of our interview with Yasheng Huang 黄亚生, the author of The Rise and Fall of the EAST: How Exams, Autocracy, Stability, and Technology Brought China Success and Why They Might Lead to Its Decline.
We cover a lot of ground in this two-hour installment. During the first hour, we discuss…

The aspects of imperial China’s governance Mao chose to embrace, and those he chose to abandon, 

The factors enabling Mao’s radical policies compared to imperial rulers,

Why China was able to grow so much faster than India, despite the setbacks of the Cultural Revolution,

Statistical approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of autocratic development models,

China’s economic reforms and rural development policies in the 1980s,

How the events of 1989 permanently altered China’s trajectory,

Whether the rise of Xi Jinping was inevitable,


In the second hour, we discuss... 

The Steelman case for why China needed a leader like Xi Jinping,

What sets Xi apart from his predecessors,

Succession challenges and the importance of term limits in authoritarian states,

Why engagement with China failed to produce political liberalization,

How the US could have better leveraged economic relations with China,

Creative approaches to human rights advocacy in China.


Outro music: Nothing to My Name (一无所有) by Cui Jian (崔健) (Youtube Link)

      <title>Autocracy, Exams and Stagnation: Imperial China's Modern Legacy</title>
      <description>Yasheng Huang 黄亚生 is the author of one of the decade’s greatest books about China — The Rise and Fall of the EAST: How Exams, Autocracy, Stability, and Technology Brought China Success and Why They Might Lead to Its Decline. It’s a rich book, a product of a career of reflections, with each page delivering something novel and provocative.
In this first half of our two-part interview, we discuss… 

How the imperial examination system (known as keju) shaped Chinese governance, culture, and society,

Why autocratic Chinese dynasties benefitted from a meritocratic bureaucracy,

Statistical methods for analyzing social mobility in imperial China,

How the keju system survived the Mongol conquest,

What the tradeoffs in the imperial exam system can teach us about the future economic prospects of China and Taiwan.

Co-hosting today is Ilari Mäkelä, host of the On Humans podcast. 
NOTES (Courtesy of Ilari)
A Rough Timeline of Chinese history:
Pre–221 BCE: Disunity (e.g. Warring States) 
221 BCE – 220: Unity (Qin &amp; Han dynasties)
220 – 581: Disunity (“Han-Sui Interregnum”)
581 – 1911: Unity (Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties)
Historical figures
Emperor Wanli 萬曆帝 | Shen Kuo 沈括 (polymath) | Zhu Xi 朱熹 (classical philosopher) | Hong Xiuquan 洪秀全 (leader of the Taiping Rebellion) | Yuan Shikai 袁世凯 (military leader) | Chiang Kai-shek 蔣介石 (military leader and statesman)
Modern scholars
Ping-ti Ho 何炳棣 (historian) | Clair Yang (economist) | Joseph Needham (scientist and historian) | Daron Acemoglu | James Robinson
Historical terms
Keju civil service exams | Taiping Rebellion

      <title>R&amp;D Renaissance with Kumar Garg</title>
      <description>To discuss America’s comparative advantages in national competition and the structural forces that drive (and limit) innovation, ChinaTalk interviewed Kumar Garg. 
Formerly an Obama official in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Kumar spent several years at Schmidt Futures focusing on science and technology philanthropy. He has been a mentor and cheerleader for ChinaTalk over the years, and he is the president of the newly established Renaissance Philanthropy.
We discuss: 

The inspiration behind Renaissance Philanthropy and its focus on mid-scale, field-transforming ideas 

Strategies for identifying underexplored, high-impact projects — including weather forecasting, carbon sequestration, and datasets on neurocognition

Structural challenges for R&amp;D funding at the level of government and universities 

The role of focused research organizations like OpenAI in accelerating progress and understanding long-term drivers of productivity 

A wide angle-view of US-China competition and strategic innovation

The underresearched importance of alliance management.

      <title>National Intel Council on The IC's Pivot to Asia</title>
      <description>Michael Collins is the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council (NIC). He has spent 28 years in the intelligence community, starting as a career analyst in the CIA focused on East Asia before moving into leadership roles. He served as chief of staff for the CIA deputy director and worked on modernization efforts in the agency.
We discuss…

How the intelligence community informs high-level policymaking,

Why different institutional approaches are needed to collect intelligence on non-state actors vs nation-state adversaries,

Challenges in assessing China’s technological and military capabilities,

“Narrative Intelligence” and areas where intelligence agencies have a unique edge,

Strategies for improving long-term forecasting and avoiding groupthink.

      <title>Competition Policy 2025</title>
      <description>To discuss the post-election future of US competition policy, ChinaTalk interviewed Peter Harrell and Nazak Nikakhtar.
Nazak served in the Trump administration after a long career as a civil servant, where she was instrumental in shaping the Commerce Department’s work on China, first at the International Trade Administration and later leading the Bureau of Industry and Security. Peter worked in the Biden administration on the National Economic Council and National Security Council, focusing on international economics, export controls, and investment restrictions.
We discuss…

The role of the executive in setting the industrial policy agenda

Leadership shortcomings in the Biden and Trump administrations

Competition with China — bipartisan consensus, bureaucratic inertia, and strategies to stop wasting time.

Advice for America’s next president, from export controls to pharmaceutical decoupling and alliance management

Creative approaches to supply chain resilience

      <title>AI and the Rise and Fall of Great Powers</title>
      <description>Jeffrey Ding is a professor at George Washington University, leading US scholar on China’s AI, and the creator of the ChinAI Substack. In honor of the publication of his new book, Technology and the Rise of Great Powers, enjoy this interview with Jeff from the ChinaTalk archives.
Jeff Ding argues in a 2023 paper that great powers must harness general-purpose technologies if they want to achieve global dominance. That is, diffusion capacity (not just innovation capacity) is critical to economic growth — and China actually fares much worse in diffusion capacity than mainstream narratives imply.
In this show, we discuss the historical underpinnings of that argument and apply it to AI today — drawing out policymaking lessons spanning centuries of technologically driven great power transitions. We also get into:

Why long-term productivity growth is driven by the diffusion of general-purpose technology, and what makes this so crucial for great power competition;

Historical lessons from the UK, Soviet Union, US, and Germany illustrating the cultural and policy roadblocks to tech diffusion;

The importance of decentralized systems, and how this helped America win the Cold War

Why China’s diffusion capacity lags behind its innovation capacity, and how America should avoid getting locked into any one technological trajectory.

      <title>History and Future of Global Patent Policy</title>
      <description>Thanks to The Innovation Alliance for sponsoring this episode. The Innovation Alliance is a coalition of research and development-based technology companies representing innovators, patent owners, and stakeholders who believe in the critical importance of maintaining a strong patent system that supports innovative enterprises of all sizes.
To discuss the domestic and international implications of patent policy, ChinaTalk interviewed Brian Pomper. Brian was the Chief International Trade Counsel to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, and he is now a partner at Akin Gump.
We discuss:

The history of America’s innovation hegemony, from the signing of the Constitution to patent trolls and Elon Musk

Why big tech companies spent decades systematically attacking the foundations of the US patent system

The thermonuclear patent war of Apple vs Samsung

The evolution of Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) as a battleground for emerging tech competition

Why China’s approach to patent litigation is causing controversy in Europe

The intersection of patent policy and international trade agreements.

      <title>Industrial Icebreaker Policy</title>
      <description>Here at ChinaTalk, we break the ice on all things international relations, and today we are diving into a topic that is snow joke — icebreakers! 
We interviewed William Henagan and Robert Obayda, both directors of the NSC. We discuss:

How Canada, Finland, and the United States are leveling up their cooperation in the Arctic through the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE Pact); 

The mechanics of industrial policy in the US government;

Why cranes matter for national security, and the benefits of using carrots vs sticks;

What icebreakers are for, and how Finland is punching above its weight in the NATO alliance.


Co-hosting today is former ChinaTalk intern Alexander Boyd, who is currently at the China Digital Times.

      <title>The Pentagon’s Innovation Insurgents</title>
      <description>Chris Kirchhoff was a founding member of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and previously worked in the Obama NSC. He recently published a book called Unit X: How the Pentagon and Silicon Valley Are Transforming the Future of War. He wrote:
“To the extent present military and civilian leadership is articulating its strategy, it is one built, for the most part, on a continuation of previous programmatic and budgetary trendlines. If there is a strategy for losing a future war in China, this is it.” 
Unit X traces the evolution of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a group of Pentagon insurgents who are fighting to change how the DoD relates to emerging technologies.
We discuss:

The origin story of DIU and its early struggles to break Pentagon bureaucracy;

How DIU leveraged “waiver authority” to circumvent red tape under Defense Secretary Ash Carter;

Why the defense industrial base is ill-equipped to keep pace with technological change;

The case for shifting more DoD spending to non-traditional tech companies;

Lessons from commercial spaceflight for future AI governance, including potential issues with a “Manhattan project for AI.”

      <title>The Chips Act and National Security</title>
      <description>After decades of neoliberalism, how much can America’s bureaucrats crank the dial on effective industrial policy? Will the CHIPS Act succeed at reshoring high-tech manufacturing?
Next week is the Chips Act’s second anniversary. To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Ben Schwartz, the former director for national security at the CHIPS Program Office, which manages a $39 billion grant program appropriated by the CHIPS and Science Act.
We get into: 

The methods and obstacles for American semiconductor policy;

How CHIPS Act guardrails aim to balance economic growth and national security; 

The negotiation process for companies interested in receiving CHIPS Act funding;

Reshoring vs friend-shoring and the challenge of Chinese dominance in legacy chip manufacturing;

Staffing and organizational structure of the CHIPS Program Office, plus the role of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo;

The challenge of collecting data on secretive semiconductor supply chains.

      <title>A BREATHER: Making Clothes in China</title>
      <description>This is a show about globalization, fashion design, and the future of manufacturing-based economic growth.
For a breather from the election chaos, ChinaTalk interviewed Will Lasry, Montreal-based designer, manufacturing specialist, and founder of Glass Factory. Will and his team are on a mission to make manufacturing transparent. They fly all around the world making documentaries on clothing factories and playing matchmaker between designers and producers. Check out his Youtube channel here. 
We discuss: 

How clothes are made, including the complicated processes behind distressed denim and other trends; 

What makes a country an ideal destination for manufacturing clothing, and whether rising labor costs will drive the industry out of China entirely;

Xinjiang cotton, environmental destruction, and other unethical practices hanging over the fashion industry;

Why Gucci and other high-end designers are betting that “Made in India” will soon be even more chic than “Made in Italy.” 


Co-hosting today is longtime ChinaTalk editor Irene Zhang.

      <description>What does JD think about currency, tariffs, and industrial policy?
How has the Strategic Patroleum Reserve evolved into new relevance with some fun new powers over the past few years, and how can America take lessons from this success and apply them to addressing critical minerals? 
And what secrets of policy entrepreneurship can Arnab teach me?
To discuss we have on Arnab Datta of Employ America and Matt Klein of The Overshoot podcast.

      <title>Sen. Young on Tech Legislation</title>
      <description>Where is Congress on AI? How will a second Trump term impact US innovation? Does Congress have what it takes to step up and legislate in a world without Chevron?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Senator Todd Young of Indiana (R). He’s a rare breed on Capitol Hill these days: an actual legislator. Sen. Young drafted the Chips and Science Act with Sen. Schumer and is the co-author of my personal favorite bill this Congress which aims to establish an Office of Global Competition Analysis. He announced earlier this year that he would not be endorsing Trump’s candidacy this cycle.
We get into…

Biden’s woes

The case for an office of tech net assessment

The future of tech legislation post-Chevron

The Senate’s AI Policy Roadmap and where the GOP is on AI regulation

Chinese espionage and high-skill immigration policy

      <title>A National Vision for Competitiveness</title>
      <description>What will it take for the US to remain competitive in 21st-century technologies? Is high state capacity a thing of the past?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed David Lin, Abigail Kukura, and Venkat Somala from the Special Competitive Studies Project. SCSP’s new report outlines exactly how America should compete in the tech-powered future of geopolitics. 
We get into…

The role of public-private research partnerships and SCSP’s relationship with the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence;

A strategy for upgrading US institutions with the help of emerging technologies like AI;

The historical decline of government-backed research in the US;

China’s industrial espionage and the potential for stolen innovations to consolidate authoritarianism across the globe;

Bureaucratic moonshots and techniques for communicating urgency to the slow-moving American polity.

      <title>Scale's Alex Wang on the US-China AI Race</title>
      <description>How could AI change the global balance of power? What could the US and allies do to preserve national moats?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed the CEO of Scale AI, Alex Wang. In a blog post announcing Scale’s $1 billion fundraising success, Alex wrote that Scale is aiming to grow into the world's data foundry for AI.
Alex grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, with two physicist parents who worked in the national labs, and he started Scale in college.
I am particularly excited to have Alex on the show because he is perhaps the only private-sector AI leader working with the DoD and thinking seriously about the national security implications of AI.
We discuss:

The three key factors limiting rapid AGI takeoff, and how quickly these barriers will be overcome;

China’s strengths and weaknesses in the race for AGI;

National security implications for winning (or losing) the AI race;

Prospects for AI net assessment and the case for a Manhattan project for data;

Methods to prevent AI espionage without kneecapping innovation or profiling immigrants.

      <title>Taiwan War + Grand Strategy for Cold War II</title>
      <description>Is Cold War II upon us? What should America do to prevent it from becoming a hot war? 
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Dmitri Alperovitch. Dmitri emigrated from Russia in 1994 at age 13. He co-founded the leading cybersecurity startup Crowdstrike, and has spent the past four years running his new think tank, the Silverado Policy Accelerator. 
He's also the author of the new book World on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the Twenty-First Century. 

We discuss:

Lessons from Cold War crises that almost went nuclear;

Underappreciated parallels between the Soviet Union and China today;

Groupthink in Washington as well as in Silicon Valley;

What a productive economic relationship with China would look like given national security concerns;

Some bold military and diplomatic recommendations for Taiwan;

… and more!

      <title>Shakespeare and Power</title>
      <link>https://open.substack.com/pub/chinatalk/p/shakespeare-and-power?r=mugtb&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web</link>
      <description>Are politicians and actors two sides of the same coin? Can you become a better public speaker by studying soliloquies? What can Shakespeare teach us about the nature of power?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Eliot Cohen: SAIS professor, military historian, and counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He is also the author of The Hollow Crown: Shakespeare on How Leaders Rise, Rule, and Fall. 
Co-hosting is Jordan’s little brother, actor Phil Schneider. He recently graduated from Yale where he starred in a production of Hamlet. He’s played Romeo, Octavius Valentine, Richard II, and Leontes. Also, he’s looking for a new agent — reach out at jordan@chinatalk.media!
They discuss: 

Royal/executive power — what getting it does to you, and why relinquishing it is so hard;

Court intrigues of yore (and today);

Timeless techniques for exhorting and manipulating the masses;

What makes a great speech;

What it really means to be an effective leader, and how great leaders know when it's time to quit.

      <title>Why America Didn't Invade Taiwan: WWII Lessons for Xi's Invasion</title>
      <description>One does not simply invade Taiwan — but George Marshall once thought long and hard about it. In 1944, in the middle of the island-hopping campaign, American war planners set their sights on Japanese-controlled Formosa.
What did the American invasion plan look like? Why did Marshall decide to go another route? What lessons do this and other amphibious invasions hold for Taiwan’s current force posture?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed US Army Field Artillery Lieutenant Colonel J. Kevin McKittrick, currently at the Air War College in Alabama and a veteran of multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Co-hosting today is our resident Taiwan consultant Nicholas Welch.
We discuss:

The US military’s aborted plan to invade Taiwan during WWII;

Why bigger is better when it comes to amphibious assaults;

What the US got right and the CCP gets wrong about civil-military relations;

Taiwan’s defense concept, and the opportunities presented by “operational pause”;

The awful, unending relevance of traditional artillery in modern war;

And why the US doesn’t need its own “rocket force” … yet.

      <title>Preventing an Invasion of Taiwan</title>
      <description>Taiwan’s government agencies are battered by 5 million cyberattacks every day. China is holding invasion drills at a replica of Taiwan’s presidential palace in Inner Mongolia. Last week, the PLA openly rehearsed an encirclement of Taiwan in so-called “punishment drills.”
What happened to deterrence in the Taiwan Strait? Can the status quo be saved?
To discuss strategies for avoiding WWIII, ChinaTalk interviewed Jared McKinney of the Air War College and Peter Harris of Colorado State University, who recently co-authored a monograph entitled, “Deterrence Gap: Avoiding War in the Taiwan Strait.”
Co-hosting today is ChinaTalk’s resident Taiwan consultant, Nicholas Welch.
We discuss…

Evidence of deterrence decay in the status quo;

The difference between constraints and restraints, and how they fit together to form a lattice of successful deterrence;

Whether symbolic solidarity with Taiwan does more harm than good;

The values and costs of strategic ambiguity;

How Taiwan can optimize its deterrence posture;

Lessons from the dance of death between Iran and Israel;

Objective factors for measuring invasion risk, and whether the world should be scared about 2027;

How to analyze decision trees for fundamentally irrational decisions;

... and more!

      <title>Sovereign AI</title>
      <description>Good AI is good and bad AI is bad, but how do lawmakers tell the difference? Will AI bring the world together or balkanize the internet beyond repair? Why do governments even need cloud computing anyway?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Pablo Chavez, a fellow at CNAS and former Vice President of Google Cloud's Public Policy division, as well as the inestimable investing tycoon Kevin Xu. Xu, formerly of GitHub, is the founder of Interconnected, a bilingual newsletter on the intersections of tech, business, investing, geopolitics, and US-Asia relations.
In this interview, we discuss:

The digital sovereignty movement and the lessons we can learn from China's Great Firewall;

The value and risks of open source architecture in the future of AI governance;

Meta’s long history of open source and how Llama fits into that strategy;

The geopolitical and cultural forces driving nations to pursue their own AI strategies;

The viability of sovereign AI initiatives in the face of global tech giants.

      <title>250 Years of US Trade Policy</title>
      <description>We're taking one out of the archives!
Douglas Irwin is a Dartmouth professor and the author of Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy. On this episode, Irwin provides an overview to the history of U.S. trade policy from the 18th century to the modern day, highlighting significant legislation as well as the formation of important intergovernmental organizations that have sprung up along the way.
Outro Music: Janis Joplin, Mercedes Benz
19:53: On the flawed logic behind the Tariff Act of 1930, and the parallels with similarly problematic thinking in the modern day: “There’s absolutely a parallel there because some Democrats in Congress said, ‘You know, we ought to really think about this carefully, and not just our domestic interest but also our export interests, and other countries might retaliate.’ And basically, the reaction of most members of Congress was, Republicans at the time, ‘No, we don’t have to worry about that. This is a domestic piece of legislation, it doesn’t really concern other countries. They’re not going to retaliate.’ And, of course, they did.”
39:40: Doug discusses the tips and tricks behind one example of “tariff engineering”: “The tariffs applied to motorcycles with piston displacements of 700cc and above. What Honda started doing is producing a 699cc version. Now the difference [between the two] is imperceptible, but just by changing that one cubic centimeter, it changed the whole tariff treatment and you avoided a 45 percent tariff and were assessed at a much, much lower rate.”

      <title>TSMC Takes Arizona</title>
      <description>TSMC is taking on Arizona. How's it going? To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Viola Zhou, journalist at Rest of World. She has published pieces on Foxconn's quest to make iPhones in India and most recently, a gripping feature about the cultural challenges that TSMC is facing trying to manufacture semiconductors in the USA. Throughout her story, we get a peek into a world of rigid hierarchies, American workers who are slow on the uptake, and culture clash over pornographic desktop flair. 
Today’s interview discusses:

Sleuthing techniques for independent journalism;

The challenges faced by Taiwanese semiconductor engineers relocating to Arizona;

TSMC’s management style and the complaints raised by new American employees;

The similarities and differences between TSMC’s expansion to the USA and Foxconn’s expansion to India;

Whether adapting to American work culture will tank the prospects of the new Phoenix Fab.

      <title>History and Future of India-China Relations</title>
      <description>India’s elections are underway! What does the future hold for the world’s largest democracy? Will the election results impact India-China relations? What about India-US relations?
To discuss, ChinaTalk interviewed Dr. Raja Mohan, Director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore.
Co-hosting today is James Crabtree, author of The Billionaire Raj.
We get into:

What the border disputes between China and India can tell us about the political economy of the two nations;

The anti-imperial history that frames India-China relations;

Modi’s election prospects and India’s spirit of democracy;

What score Biden’s diplomatic team has earned in Southeast Asia;

Criticisms of Modi and accusations of democratic backsliding;

Opportinities for friction in the US-India relationship, including Trump tariffs, immigration, and Russia;

Whether the US is making a “bad bet” on India, and how India is prepared to involve itself during an invasion of Taiwan.

      <title>DOJ vs Data Espionage</title>
      <description>The DOJ is now charged with protecting American data from foreign adversaries. This new proposed rule they recently issued is, according to one observer, “one of the most ambitious and sweeping new initiatives in national security law over the past few years.”
To discuss, we interviewed Devin DeBacker and Lee Licata of the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.
We get into:

How adversaries plan to weaponize obscure data types — including geolocation data, DNA sequencing, and undersea cable transmissions;

How China managed to purchase genomic data on millions of Americans through healthcare investments;

Why black box data brokers keep records of who goes to casinos;

How the DOJ plans to protect your data, and whether their plans can be thwarted by gridlock in Congress.


I’m excited to introduce a partnership with Policyware to bring affordable, expert-driven policy education to my audience. Starting May 14, Samm Sacks will be teaching a deep dive into China’s Digital Governance and its Global Implications.
Samm is an old friend of mine and a Senior Fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center. She is a leading expert on China’s cybersecurity legal system, the U.S.-China technology relationship, and the geopolitics of data privacy and cross-border data flows. Check out below a show I did with Samm on ChinaTalk discussing China’s digital governance.
You’ll learn over several weeks as Samm delivers live classes, with options to listen on your own time. Policyware Deep Dives are designed to be attended alongside your job, and they will help you organize with your employer for cost sharing. Check out the show we did together on data issues late last year.

      <title>Japan's Economic Security Renaissance</title>
      <description>To learn about Japan’s new economic national security policy, export controls, chip policy, lessons from history, and even space policy, we interviewed Kazuto Suzuki.
Suzuki-san is a professor at the University of Tokyo. He serves as an advisor to Japan’s Ministry of the Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) as well as advising Japan’s space program. He served on the UN Security Council's Iran Sanctions Panel, and he also recently established the Institute of Geoeconomics at the International House of Japan. 
We get into…

What Japan’s new economic national security law does, and what it means for global semiconductor supply chains;

The state of multilateral export controls;

Nippon steel, the US election, and cooperation between East Asian democracies;

Historical examples of economic coercion, from the Qing Dynasty to FDR vs imperial Japan to the Senkaku islands;

Japan’s goals for space commercialization;

… and more!
Co-hosting today is Arrian Ebrahimi, student at Yenching academy and author of the Chip Capitols Substack.

      <title>Amb. Rahm Emanuel on China and Japan</title>
      <description>Straight from Tokyo, Japan: an exclusive with Amb. Rahm Emanuel.
Before his current posting as US ambassador to Japan, Rahm served as a senior advisor to Bill Clinton, multiple terms in the US House of Representatives, Obama’s first chief of staff, and the mayor of Chicago.
If nothing else, you can count on his gloves-off, no-holds-barred approach to politics — and he’s been no different when it comes to China. Notwithstanding reports that even officials in Biden’s NSC have told him to stop “taunting” China, Rahm has been consistently, uniquely willing to say out loud what virtually every other high-ranking US official doesn’t.
Of course, the ambassador — or, as his desk placard during his chief-of-staff days read, “Undersecretary for Go Fuck Yourself” — may take issue with that framing. His comments aren’t “critical,” Rahm says, but “truthful.”
This interview covers a ton of ground. On China:

How the Biden administration is closing the chapter on “hub and spokes,” what tomorrow’s “latticework” architecture will look like, and what Asia-Pacific alliances might look like under a second Trump administration;

The future of Japan-Korea, and a peek behind the curtain on how the historic Camp David summit materialized;

Rahm’s “3 Cs” for China — calm, conflict, charm — and how US foreign-policy leaders should reckon the mutual inconsistencies among those three;

And roads not taken by Xi: why Rahm thinks China’s entrepreneurial culture has taken a nosedive, and what China’s government today is most scared of.

And on politics and life:

Why “diplomacy” and “politics” are the same thing — and why that’s a good thing;

Whether the State Department suffers from a personality deficit, and what makes for a good ambassador;

How to heal America’s body politic — post-Trump, post-Recession, post-GWOT;

Why Rahm thinks “quality time” with kids is “BS,” and thoughts on raising kids as a time-crunched politician;

And what Rahm thinks the biggest emerging threat to the world is.

I really enjoyed my trip to Japan, and I’d love a financial excuse to continue recording shows on the country. If you work at JETRO, METI, The Japan Foundation, Mitsubishi, Rakuten, etc. and are interested in seeing more deep coverage of Japan and US-China-Japan relations on this podcast, do reach out!

      <title>Biotech 101</title>
      <description>Biotech. What is it? Why should you care? Does biotech really matter for national security? What are China’s biotech ambitions?
To find out, ChinaTalk interviewed Jason Kelly, the Chair and Vice Chair of the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. Jason is the Co-Founder and CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, a publicly traded firm that provides a horizontal platform for cell programming. Michelle Rozo is currently Vice President of Technical Capabilities at In-Q-Tel, and she previously held positions in Biden’s NSC, the Department of Defense, and on the Hill.
Co-hosting today is Chris “CRISPR” Miller, author of Chip War.
We get into:

The powerful science behind genetic engineering ;

How the US government turned biotechnology into a $1 trillion industry over the course of the last fifty years;

Why generative AI is destined to revolutionize synthetic biology;

And whether China’s national biotech champions can leapfrog the US.

      <title>Matt Clifford on China, AI Safety, and Entrepreneurship</title>
      <description>How do you stand up an effective national AI project? Is the world prepared for the Reformation-level societal change AI could bring?
Matt Clifford, according to Politico Britain’s most powerful tech adviser, joins ChinaTalk to discuss! He served as Prime Minister Sunak's sherpa for the UK AI Summit, chairs ARIA, the UK's answer to DARPA, and co-founded Entrepreneur First, a startup incubator with a strong presence throughout Europe and Southeast Asia. 
We get into:


Tech Diplomacy &amp; the UK AI Safety Summit: How countries are waking up to the watershed moment at the advent of powerful new AI, and the surprising commonalities in China’s perspectives on AI safety. 


Organizational Design at ARIA: What are the challenges creating a world-class science project in government? How can you attract the best people and create the right organizational culture for success?


Open Source AI and the Global AI Race — How should we evaluate the approaches to AI across different countries and private actors? What’s the verdict on open source models?


Preparing for monumental changes — and why history cautions against expecting business as usual, and how fiction can open our mind to the possibilities.

Why Weibo keeps Molly up at night;

Chinese elementary school kids’ academic prowess;

How social issues gain attention on the trending list;

Terrible bots;

And what makes microblogging uniquely compelling.

      <title>AI + The State Department</title>
      <description>How can AI change diplomacy?
To discuss the State Department’s options for AI integration, we interviewed the State Department's Deputy Chief Data and AI Officer, Garrett Berntsen. He served as an officer during two tours in Afghanistan and recently rotated off the NSC. He's optimistic diplomacy can be more effective with comprehensive, timely, and accurate data-driven analysis, and that AI will be part of achieving that mission.
We get into:

How AI can streamline bureaucratic busy work

The value of data-driven negotiation prep in diplomatic contexts

The benefits of transparency in a democratic society

What level of risk is appropriate for the civil service

How close he is to getting ChatGPT into State

The balance between transparency and secrecy in the age of big data

How the Snowden leaks changed the State Department’s relationship with technology

What the State Department can and can't import from the private sector

      <title>India's Chip War</title>
      <description>Why can India design chips with the best of them but has completely failed to develop fabs, much less a broader electronics industry? To discuss, I have on Pranay Kotasthane, former chip designer at TI and Qualcomm who now works at the Takshashila Institution and is the author of the new book When the Chips are Down.
Chris Miller of Chip War cohosts.
We get into:

How the political economy of technology in India led to world class software and services but underwhelming manufacturing

Why India was slower to the uptake than China that socialism really sucks at getting your country rich

What it takes to design a chip.

      <title>AI at the Frontier: What it Takes to Compete</title>
      <description>What does it take to train a frontier model? What's the know-how, the secret sauce that makes firms lets OpenAI and Deepmind push the limits of what's possible? How much are Chinese firms benefitting from western open source, and in the long term is it possible for western labs to maintain an edge?
The hosts of the excellent Latent Space podcast, Alessio Fanelli of Decibel VC and Shawn Wang of Smol AI, come on to discuss.
We get into:

How the secret sauce used to push the frontier of AI diffuses out of the top labs and into substacks

How labs are managing the culture change from quasi-academic outfits to places that have to ship

How open source raises the global AI standard, but why there's likely to always be a gap between closed and open source

China as a "GPU Poor" nation

Three key algorithmic innovations that could reshape the balance of power between the GPU rich and GPU poor

The met description: In this whimsical maiolica sculpture, a well-dressed man leans forward in his seat with his head in a covered pot set above a fiery hearth. The vessel beside the hearth almost certainly held ink. The man’s actions are explained by an inscription on the chair: "I distill my brain and am totally happy." Thus the task of the writer is equated with distillation—the process through which a liquid is purified by heating and cooling, extracting its essence.

      <title>Pottinger on Trump 2.0</title>
      <description>Matt Pottinger reported for years out of China, served as a US Marine Corps intelligence officer in Iraq and Afghanistan, and held several senior roles on Trump's NSC , concluding his time in the White House as the Deputy National Security Advisor.
Today, Matt chairs the China Program at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.
In this interview, we discuss:

How Matt expects a second Trump administration’s China policy might develop.

Why Trump is leaning more into strategic ambiguity than Biden, what that means for deterrence, and how that impacts the likelihood of him standing by were the PRC to invade Taiwan.

Why bipartisan support for the US-China trade war will continue to shape the contours of great-power conflict.

Matt’s look at the origins and political fallout of COVID-19.

Plus, reflections on Mike Flynn and how Trump ran his NSC.

      <title>Is the NSC Unwell?</title>
      <description>Heart attacks, prostate cancer, Jake Sullivan awake for a home invasion attempt at 4 AM because he was just up working on a random Tuesday night?
Is the national security bureaucracy in America unwell?
To discuss, I have on today John Gans, a former Pentagon speechwriter, who’s had many, many other jobs in Washington. He is also the author of the fantastic “White House Warriors,” a history of the National Security Council.  
We get into:

Why the organizational design of the NSC leads to such crushing burdens for midlevel and senior staffers

The kinds of high-flyers that are drawn to the national security complex and what keeps them there

How POTUS’s time constraints impact decision-making

Why NSC’s historically are excellent at spotting problems but often overeager when crafting solutions

The NSC’s role in America’s “forever wars.”

Roosevelt, Kennedy, Nixon, and Trump’s “maverick model” of running the NSC compared to the Eisenhower vision of “regular order”

How seemingly prosaic technological innovations like track changes and video conferencing have dramatically changed national security policymaking

How reading Shakespeare can improve the quality of our policy-making

What a better model could look like

<li>Why the organizational design of the NSC leads to such crushing burdens for midlevel and senior staffers</li>
<li>The kinds of high-flyers that are drawn to the national security complex and what keeps them there</li>
<li>How POTUS’s time constraints impact decision-making</li>
<li>Why NSC’s historically are excellent at spotting problems but often overeager when crafting solutions</li>
<li>The NSC’s role in America’s “forever wars.”</li>
<li>Roosevelt, Kennedy, Nixon, and Trump’s “maverick model” of running the NSC compared to the Eisenhower vision of “regular order”</li>
<li>How seemingly prosaic technological innovations like track changes and video conferencing have dramatically changed national security policymaking</li>
<li>How reading Shakespeare can improve the quality of our policy-making</li>
<li>What a better model could look like</li>

      <title>Taiwan Election Results and Implications for Beijing</title>
      <description>Kharis Templeman, research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, returns to ChinaTalk to break down the recent Taiwan elections, held on January 13.

We discuss:

The lack of surprises in the election results, the subdued vibes during the campaign, and contrasts between local perspectives and foreign media narratives.

Why the KMT failed to win the presidency, notwithstanding voter dissatisfaction with the DPP.

China’s surprisingly muted response to the election, and how it may reassess its cross-Strait policies given a third DPP president.

The new composition of the Legislative Yuan, and the strategic position of the Taiwan People’s Party as gatekeeper.

Observations from Kharis’s time in Taiwan during the election season, and the gift of Taiwan’s democratic process.

      <title>How the Navy Learned to Fight</title>
      <description>How did the US Navy evolve over the first half of the 20th century from a bunch of unschooled violent sailors who couldn't shoot straight to the world's largest and most technologically advanced fighting force? What lessons around organizational design can we learn from this transformation?
Trent Hone, author of Learning War and Mastering the Art of Command, joins to discuss.

      <title>Best Chinese Music of 2023</title>
      <description>Jake Newby of the substack Concrete Avalanche with an end of year ChinaTalk takeover!
Here's his accompanying year in review post https://jakenewby.substack.com/p/2023-in-review?utm_source=activity_item
Tracklist:
Intro: 'Lost in China' (excerpt) – Tation 天声 (self-released) This 'postmodernist rock band from Tibet' produced some of their best work to date on the remarkable Illusions of the New Era EP.
‘Wen’s Woozy Wrap’ – Pu Poo Platter (fRUITYSHOP) Key cut from Brooklyn-formed Chinese funk group’s debut LP.
‘Greedysleeper’ – A Wordless Orange 沉默橙 (Taihe) Young Wuhan group deliver soulful pop-rock on one of the year’s best albums.
‘Watch the Crown’ – BoomHan 包涵 (Seafood Market Records) A sample of the 17-year-old Changsha rap prodigy’s impressive flow, from his debut album Gravediggaz.
‘Umbrella’ (featuring J-Fever) – PO8 (Tildawn Music) Not a Rihanna cover. Chengdu rapper toys with Shanghai jazz sounds.
‘Rap’ – ZhiYu Xia 夏之禹 (Mintone Records) Sichuan-born rapper, dubbed ‘the Jia Zhangke of hip hop’, dissects how he fell in love with the genre.
‘Where’s Tommy?’ – Hualun 花伦 (bié Records) intriguing change of direction from the ambient soundtrack masters.
‘Specter’ – The Fallacy 疯医 (Modern Sky) Brilliant return to form from Henan post-punks enlivened by new recruit Li Zenghui, who also played sax with Black Midi earlier this year
‘Cliff’ – The river, Orchestration, Walkman! 河边走 (self-released) Short sharp burst of bewildering brassy brilliance from one of the best new bands to emerge in 2023.
‘Vanished Instant’ – A Fishy Tale 有话 (Qiii Snacks Records) Another young band with a psychedelic sound; recorded during a trip to a Zhejiang mountain village.
‘East Yunnan Hallucinations’ – Instinkto Industrio 本能事业 (Maybe Mars) Folksy rhythms mix with techno-dystopian lyrics on one of 2023’s most characterful records. 
‘Standing in the Wind’ – Zhaoze 沼泽 (self-released) Guangdong guqin-driven post-rock outfit’s new album is one of their best.
‘Station 2020’ – Wu Zhuoling 吴卓玲 (self-released) The leading lady of alternative Chengdu music serves up an immersive ambient tune.
‘The Little Assassin Who Lives Beside the Sea Becomes and Environmentalist’ – Li Daiguo 李带菓 (Beihesan) The Dali-based artist had a productive year; this beautiful number was among the highlights.
‘Daididau’ (excerpt) – Mamer (Old Heaven Books) A too-short taste of a 7-minute long improvised piece on traditional Kazakh instrument the sherter from musical genius Mamer.
‘Four Seasons’ – Hugjiltu (self-released) An emotive folk number from an album featuring ‘collaborations’ with tapes of the Mongolian musician’s late father.
‘Harbour for Bias’ – Louzhang 楼长 (Jyugam) An alt-ambient highlight from a strong year for this offbeat Guangdong electronic label.
‘Snoring in the Valley’ – Howie Lee (self-released) Quirky electronic music from the renowned producer, quietly slipped out at the start of the year.
‘Solaris’ – Zhang Weiwei 张玮玮 (self-released) Chinese folk grandee swaps his accordion for a synth to interesting effect on his first album in over a decade.
‘I Want An Earth’ – Yu Su (pinchy&amp;friends) Title track from the celebrated producer’s impressive EP of clever, beguiling electronic sounds.
‘Holes of Time’ – 33EMYBW (SVBKVLT) A typically idiosyncratic slice of avant club music from one of China’s leading producers.
‘The Forest That Hears’ – Laughing Ears (self-released) A welcome return from one of the country’s most interesting electronic music artists.
‘W.C.’ (Liars remix) – otay:onii (No Gold) Acclaimed artist Angus Andrew adds a new dimension to otay:onii’s weirdness after bié Records released her third LP in March.
‘Ἀντὶ θεῶν’ – Ὁπλίτης (self-released) Incredible one-man-band creating blistering metal tunes examining Chinese social issues. In Greek, obviously.

Here's his accompanying year in review post https://jakenewby.substack.com/p/2023-in-review?utm_source=activity_item
Tracklist:
Intro: 'Lost in China' (excerpt) – Tation 天声 (self-released) This 'postmodernist rock band from Tibet' produced some of their best work to date on the remarkable Illusions of the New Era EP.
‘Wen’s Woozy Wrap’ – Pu Poo Platter (fRUITYSHOP) Key cut from Brooklyn-formed Chinese funk group’s debut LP.
‘Greedysleeper’ – A Wordless Orange 沉默橙 (Taihe) Young Wuhan group deliver soulful pop-rock on one of the year’s best albums.
‘Watch the Crown’ – BoomHan 包涵 (Seafood Market Records) A sample of the 17-year-old Changsha rap prodigy’s impressive flow, from his debut album Gravediggaz.
‘Umbrella’ (featuring J-Fever) – PO8 (Tildawn Music) Not a Rihanna cover. Chengdu rapper toys with Shanghai jazz sounds.
‘Rap’ – ZhiYu Xia 夏之禹 (Mintone Records) Sichuan-born rapper, dubbed ‘the Jia Zhangke of hip hop’, dissects how he fell in love with the genre.
‘Where’s Tommy?’ – Hualun 花伦 (bié Records) intriguing change of direction from the ambient soundtrack masters.
‘Specter’ – The Fallacy 疯医 (Modern Sky) Brilliant return to form from Henan post-punks enlivened by new recruit Li Zenghui, who also played sax with Black Midi earlier this year
‘Cliff’ – The river, Orchestration, Walkman! 河边走 (self-released) Short sharp burst of bewildering brassy brilliance from one of the best new bands to emerge in 2023.
‘Vanished Instant’ – A Fishy Tale 有话 (Qiii Snacks Records) Another young band with a psychedelic sound; recorded during a trip to a Zhejiang mountain village.
‘East Yunnan Hallucinations’ – Instinkto Industrio 本能事业 (Maybe Mars) Folksy rhythms mix with techno-dystopian lyrics on one of 2023’s most characterful records. 
‘Standing in the Wind’ – Zhaoze 沼泽 (self-released) Guangdong guqin-driven post-rock outfit’s new album is one of their best.
‘Station 2020’ – Wu Zhuoling 吴卓玲 (self-released) The leading lady of alternative Chengdu music serves up an immersive ambient tune.
‘The Little Assassin Who Lives Beside the Sea Becomes and Environmentalist’ – Li Daiguo 李带菓 (Beihesan) The Dali-based artist had a productive year; this beautiful number was among the highlights.
‘Daididau’ (excerpt) – Mamer (Old Heaven Books) A too-short taste of a 7-minute long improvised piece on traditional Kazakh instrument the sherter from musical genius Mamer.

      <title>Taiwan Election Showdown! A Blue Prof and Green Pol Explain</title>
      <description>The Taiwanese populace will head to the polls to choose their next president on January 13, 2024 — and the three-party slate is set!
To discuss, we brought on Lu Yeh-chung 盧業中 — a professor of diplomacy at National Chengchi University 國立政治大學 — and Lin Fei-fan 林飛帆, previously the Deputy-Secretary of the DPP and well-known for leading the Sunflower Student Movement in 2014.
Our conversation gets into:

What a three-party race means in a first-past-the-post electoral system, and how the pan-blue and pan-green camps are feeling;

Why the KMT-TPP alliance broke down, and what the pan-blue side needs to do to mobilize its electorate;

The KMT’s and DPP’s views on whether Taiwanese and mainland Chinese are part of the same family 兩岸一家人;

What the 1992 Consensus means to the KMT and DPP, and the tensions and synergies between idealism and functionalism in Taiwanese politics;

How the CCP views the upcoming election, and to what extent it really fears pro-independence activists in Taiwan;

What demarcates the KMT and DPP outside of cross-Strait politics, and which domestic issues are most compelling for the average Taiwanese voter;

And how the KMT and DPP balance government spending on hard military assets versus subsidizing critical technologies like semiconductors.


DPP ticket:

president: William Lai Ching-te 賴清德

vice president: Hsiao Bi-khim 蕭美琴


KMT ticket:

president: Hou Yu-ih 侯友宜

vice president: Jaw Shaw-kong 趙少康


TPP ticket:

president: Ko Wen-je 柯文哲

vice president: Cynthia Wu Hsin-ying 吳欣盈

      <title>RAND CEO Jason Matheny Gives a Masterclass on Risk and Organizational Design</title>
      <description>This interview was so good.
Jason Matheny, Biden's former top tech + national security advisor, has recently reached one year as CEO of RAND.
We had a truly classic ChinaTalk-style conversation, hitting on:

How to design a world-class research organization

The right and wrong lessons to learn from RAND's heyday in the 1950s

Existential risks around AI and bio

Government's capacity to grok and implement technology strategy

What national security professionals can learn from art and architecture

And a ton more.

      <title>Emergency Pod: AI Executive Order!</title>
      <description>Biden just dropped a 50 page executive order that's going to make the world safe for AI, hopefully? To discuss the sprawling EO we've brought on three CNAS analysts, Vivek Chilukuri, Bill Drexel and Tim Fist.
We touch on:

Immigration and federal hiring

If AI + bio can ever be a safe thing

What's going to happen to cloud access

What are the hoops you'll need to jump through to train GPT5 and whether they're enough

What to do about open source

Why Jordan just wants to be an AI czar


RSVP to the Los Angeles meetup! https://partiful.com/e/SgjdajUSrD1aEOOrVgXk

Outro music (yea I was not going to impose Devo on you all): The B Tune by Bela Fleck https://open.spotify.com/track/6h6vvG1t4xtfP9lkOKzBTv?si=6ec3f32629bd46a2

      <title>Can AI Be Governed?</title>
      <description>In this episode, Jordan Schneider interviews Markus Anderling and Anton Korinek, two of the coauthors of the paper 'Frontier AI Regulation: Managing Emerging Risks to Public Safety'. They discuss the need for regulation and oversight of advanced AI models, known as frontier models, that have the potential to pose significant risks to public safety and national security.
Jordan came in as a skeptic. Will he be convinced?
Here's the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03718
Here's Markus' song choice: - -- ・ -・・ ・ ・-・・ ・- https://open.spotify.com/album/1NogWso5ElfJe4n8qKSdy9?si=mD9j5WB3TWuFGVkJRBI_Jg

      <title>PLA Purges + Taiwan War Risk</title>
      <description>Defense Minister Li Shangfu just got officially purged. To discuss, we brought on Joel Wuthnow, a fellow at NDU. His research areas include Chinese foreign and security policy, Chinese military affairs, US-China relations, and strategic developments in East Asia. He joined ChinaTalk to discuss Xi Jinping’s recent purges of high-ranking members of the People’s Liberation Army, Xi’s larger vision for the PLA, and what all this internal turmoil might mean for China’s longer-term designs on Taiwan. This was recorded earlier in October.
Key insights:

Over ten years after coming to power, Xi is still purging corruption from the military, reflecting his continued lack of trust in the PLA;

Corruption is historically endemic in the PLA in part because of its incentive structure, which makes graft a prerequisite for rising through the ranks;

Xi’s efforts to break up the PLA’s supervisory apparatus have only been partially successful (they’re still the same people even if they’re in a different department);

Amid the anti-corruption shakeup, China’s Rocket Force has been successfully developing hypersonic missiles, technology viewed as critical to countering US intervention in a regional conflict over Taiwan;

Despite Xi’s apparent distrust of his inner circle of military advisors, an echo chamber–induced invasion of Taiwan is still a live possibility.


Joel Wuthnow is a senior research fellow with the National Defense University.
Nicholas Welch cohosts.

      <title>Cities of Slaughter</title>
      <description>Israel is a country dear to my heart and I wanted to provide the ChinaTalk audience with one more perspective on the events of this past weekend before returning to our regularly scheduled program.
To that end, I'm running a guest episode from the Promised Podcast, a show from TLV1 which is "an inside view of how Israel can warm your heart and make your blood boil. It’s a show by a journalist, a professor and an NGO professional who live in and love Israel even though it drives them crazy, and who each week discuss the latest in Israeli politics, culture, and society."
Thanks for listening.

      <title>EMERGENCY POD: Two Views from Israel on Hamas + China-Middle East Relations</title>
      <description>We discuss their experience of the past few days, China's response, its broader policy and aspirations in the Middle East, and what comes next.
Our first guest is Carice Witte who is the founder and director of the SIGNAL Group.
Second in the episode is Ofir Dayan, a researcher at the Israel-China Policy Center at INSS.
Outtro music: World Champion, sung by family members and victims of terrorism https://youtu.be/yofkk5Vaif8?si=JskMFXK3-srR5z8L
Lyrics translation:
I'm a world champion in repressing
Anything that scares me, anything stressful, I put on mute
I'm a world champion in loving
Firstly myself, then at the stage and the street
The hardest is to give it to someone close
I'm a world champion in not being
In not solving your problems
Even the pictures on the walls
I wasn't the one who hanged them
I'm only in charge of the melodies
 
I'm a world champion in falling
And getting back up like a champ
You'll see, like a phoenix
I'm burning, but choosing every day to live on
I'm a world champion in wanting
At least trying
You'll see, how in the end
After the losses, the victory is so much sweeter
I'm a world champion
 
I'm a world champion in justifying
Weaknesses and desires
The urge is an old acquaintance
I know every old trick it keeps in its bag
But look, someday I'll be righteous
Deep down what I have is not enough, at all
I'm a little rat and life is a pipe1
Falling down the hole because I can't distinguish
Between good and evil, and where does it all lead to
You're being all usual
But soon we'll run out of fuse
 
I'm a world champion in falling
And getting back up like a champ
You'll see, like a phoenix
I'm burning, but choosing every day to live on
I'm a world champion in wanting
At least trying
You'll see, how in the end
After the losses, the victory is so much sweeter
I'm a world champion
 
I'm a world champion in compensating
Apologizing and pleasing
Sinning, cleansing myself
Exposing, covering up
Say, how can one write songs with a thousand expectations
Millions of views
 
I'm a world champion in falling
And getting back up like a champ
You'll see, like a phoenix
I'm burning, but choosing every day to live on
I'm a world champion

      <title>Kurt Campbell on Grand Strategy and US-China</title>
      <description>Kurt Campbell is the Deputy Assistant to the President and the White House Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs. ChinaTalk recently joined Campbell in Washington to discuss US-China relations and mark the podcast’s 300th episode.
We discuss:

The nature of national power today;

If China is peaking;

How ideology impacts Beijing’s foreign policy;

Campbell’s hopes and fears for the Biden administration’s Asia policy;

Whether the US is still aiming to “maintain as large of a lead as possible” on chips and AI;

How to think about the risk of and effectively deter military escalation;

And the dark shadow of Tiananmen and its lasting impact on Chinese politics and US foreign policy.

      <description>James Wang, partner at Creative Ventures, joins to discuss:

Huawei breakthrough implications and why NVIDIA's CUDA will make it particularly difficult to create a useful domestic AI chip

Why China's AI companies have been underperforming my expectations


How semiconductor industry dynamics parallel the challenges facing AI startups

How pizza machines explain AI's future impact on the labor market

Challenges and opportunities in investing in deep tech, including the eager but raw founder talent pool as well as the importance of market structure and distinguishing between R&amp;D and engineering risk

      <title>EMERGENCY POD: Huawei's Breakthrough, the Technical, Industrial and Strategic Implications</title>
      <description>Huawei’s breakthrough Kirin 9000s: what is it, why is it a big deal, and what if anything should the US do about it? Joining me, I have on two fantastic semiconductor analysis, Doug O'Laughlin of Fabricated Knowledge and Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis. We get into:

How this chip illustrates Chinese engineering excellence and the porous nature of the current export control regime

Why we can expect AI chips on par with the A100 coming out of China in the next two years

What steps the US government could take to tighten export controls and set back the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem

How China has come to dominate both the lagging edge and the EV space


Here's my piece on the topic: https://www.chinatalk.media/p/huaweis-breakthrough-the-strategic
And here's Dylan's: https://www.semianalysis.com/p/china-ai-and-semiconductors-rise

<li>How this chip illustrates Chinese engineering excellence and the porous nature of the current export control regime</li>
<li>Why we can expect AI chips on par with the A100 coming out of China in the next two years</li>
<li>What steps the US government could take to tighten export controls and set back the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem</li>
<li>How China has come to dominate both the lagging edge and the EV space</li>

      <title>Why Congress Can Save Us All</title>
      <description>This episode of China Talk explores the past, present, and future of Congress with AEI's Philip Wallach. We get into:

Origins of representative government trace back to medieval England, when the king consulted regional advisors – leading to development of Parliament

Founders inspired by this model when establishing Congress, wanting representation for diverse parts of young U.S.

But competing visions emerged for how Congress should work:

Madison's view: embrace factional conflict and compromise

Wilson's view: stronger centralized leadership

These tensions played out through different eras of Congress:

Early years: backlash against Hamilton’s Treasury power leads to first political party

New Deal/WWII: Congress oversees executive branch while enabling key programs

Civil rights era: Senate leaders allow extended filibuster, focus national attention, build enduring coalition

1970s reforms decentralize Congress but decrease cooperation between members over time

Under 1994 Gingrich revolution, partisan centralization becomes norm – embraced by both parties

Potential futures discussed, including a fever dream of Philip's where an immigration crisis actually prompts real lawmaking.


Outtro music: Nixon's 1972 campaign song

      <title>Culture Month! Painting in Premodern China</title>
      <description>Culture month continues with some traditional Chinese painting coverage!
What was it like to paint in premodern China? How did a husband-wife and master-mentee team up to produce some remarkable art? Why is it okay to say Chinese art is "good" or "bad" while those who critique western art have so much heartburn over saying their opinion?
Cohosting is Joseph Scheier-Dolberg, Chinese paintings curator at the MET.
This episode is better experienced on YouTube. Check out the video on ChinaTalk's YouTube channel here: https://youtu.be/Rxr6xOj29A8

      <title>Beyond Decoupling: NATO for Trade</title>
      <description>Should democracies band together to protect themselves from Chinese economic coercion? What can deterrence theory teach us about geoeconomic strategy?
To discuss these questions, I brought on Matt Goodman and Matt Reynolds of CSIS along with Matt Klein of The Overshoot and David Talbot of the Milken Institute.
We discuss:
–Why China uses economic coercion, especially against smaller states.
–How democracies might join together to deter and respond to this aggression.
–Why reslience beats retaliation when it comes to economic conflict.
Outro music: "(You're The) Devil in Disguise," Elvis Presley.

      <title>How Can the Pentagon Trust AI?</title>
      <description>How is the DoD thinking about deploying AI? What are the challenges and opportunities involved in building out AI assurance?
To discuss, I brought on Dr. Jane Pinelis, Chief AI Engineer The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. She was previously the Chief of the Test, Evaluation, and Assessment branch at the Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). Prior to joining the JAIC, Dr. Pinelis served as the Director of Test and Evaluation for USDI’s Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, better known as Project Maven.

      <title>EMERGENCY POD: Qin Gone!</title>
      <description>Until yesterday, Qin Gang 秦刚 was serving as China’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. But on Monday, July 24, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee announced an emergency meeting for the next day, July 25, during which Qin was “removed” 免职 (albeit not “dismissed” 撤职) from his position as China’s #2 diplomat.
To dissect the rumors and make sense of it all, we have on Matt Brazil — a senior China analyst at BluePath Labs, writer for SpyTalk, fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, and longtime friend ChinaTalk. (Check out our January 2021 show with Matt!)
We discuss:

Precisely what we know and don’t know about l’affaire Qin;

How journalist Fu Xiaotian 傅晓田 is wrapped up in all of this — and how those with CCP connections somehow end up with private jets and buy-ins to elite universities;

Qin’s possible connections to the Ministry of State Security — and why that might rub his subordinates the wrong way;

How the CCP has dispensed with previous political elites, and whether Qin’s treatment resembles theirs; and

Why it is that sometimes even the heads of CCP security don’t even know what’s going on!

      <title>Taiwan’s Presidential Elections: A Primer</title>
      <description>ChinaTalk welcomes Taiwan expert and Hoover research fellow Kharis Templeman. This episode is all things 2024 Taiwan elections — slated for January 13, 2024.
In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Kharis is the program manager of the Project on Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific, and previously was the program manager of the Taiwan Democracy and Security Project.
In this show, we discuss:

The frontrunners’ profiles — Lai Ching-te 賴清德, Hou Yu-ih 侯友宜, and Ko Wen-je 柯文哲 — and what makes this three-way race different from previous elections;

Why the KMT’s nomination process was somewhat quirky this time around;

The importance of party unity, and why some Taiwanese political parties have failed to unify in past election cycles;

What’s on Taiwanese voters’ minds — beyond national-security concerns;

The CCP’s preferred winner — plus if and how any PRC-based interference may manifest over the coming months;

Why Taiwan’s election system is “unhackable”;

What to make of the spread of disinformation and hyper-partisanship in Taiwan’s domestic media;

And some pro tips on escaping the DC bubble and understanding the Taiwanese populace.

      <title>Why Chinese EVs Will Take Over the World</title>
      <description>• How did the Chinese EV industry become so dominant?
• What institutional and cultural factors shape China’s auto market?
• What can Western democracies learn from Chinese industrial policy?

To discuss these questions, I brought on GWU professor John Helveston, an expert in tech and innovation policy and Chinese electric vehicles.

      <title>Moneyball for Foreign Aid</title>
      <description>Foreign aid is dominated by just a few huge players that receive the bulk of grants from the US government. But is bigger better? And are local players with innovative solutions to global issues missing out?
Unlock Aid wants to see smaller stakeholders get access to more funding and seats at the table. The group’s executive director, Walter Kerr and COO Amanda Arch explain why.
We also discuss:

How much the US spends on foreign aid each year and who gets that money.

How to make the distribution of foreign aid more efficient.

Why Unlock Aid wants to break down the barriers to accessing public funding.

How AI could be used in foreign aid.

China’s latest attempts to restrict data access to international researchers.

      <itunes:summary>Foreign aid is dominated by just a few huge players that receive the bulk of grants from the US government. But is bigger better? And are local players with innovative solutions to global issues missing out?
Unlock Aid wants to see smaller stakeholders get access to more funding and seats at the table. The group’s executive director, Walter Kerr and COO Amanda Arch explain why.
We also discuss:

How much the US spends on foreign aid each year and who gets that money.

How to make the distribution of foreign aid more efficient.

Why Unlock Aid wants to break down the barriers to accessing public funding.

How AI could be used in foreign aid.

China’s latest attempts to restrict data access to international researchers.

      <title>PLA Invasion: Is Taiwan's Military Ready?</title>
      <description>Paul Huang, Taiwan military expert and research fellow at the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation, returns to ChinaTalk! Today he gives us an update on Taiwan’s military readiness, the PLA’s expansion, and whether Xi Jinping would really send it.
If you missed his episode back in 2020, give it a listen, too. And check out his recent thoughts posted on NBR, as well as his long-form special report, “Threats to Taiwan’s Security from China’s Military Modernization.”
In this episode, we cover:

The status quo of Taiwan’s reservist forces and command-and-control capabilities — and how Western countries perceive that status quo;

How the PLA’s military capabilities stack up against Russia’s performance in the Ukraine war thus far;

What insights we can glean from PLA-facing propaganda;

Why Ukrainian forces have been successful in repelling the Russian military thus far, and why Xi Jinping would loathe a protracted war over Taiwan;

Paul’s take on the PLA’s recent military maneuvers against US and Canadian assets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea;

What the Taiwanese populace believes about PLA military action, US military support for Taiwan — and why these trends have changed over time;

China’s robust satellite expansion program, and how it plays a role in its aircraft carrier “kill chain”;

Likely and unlikely PLA invasion scenarios — and the corresponding discussions that would occur in the White House;

What Taiwan military officials — like Admiral Lee Hsi-ming (Ret.) 李喜明 — think about Taiwan’s military readiness for an invasion.

Dr. Nina Kollars, advisor to Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) Heidi Shyu, and R&amp;E’s Chief Data Officer Cyrus Jabbari join us to discuss in a wide ranging and at times philosophical conversation about

the challenges of peacetime innovation

critical technology lists

lessons from the origins of the machine gun and development of modern fighter jets

What Cezanne and Picasso can teach us about military innovation (from this piece https://warontherocks.com/2017/03/when-clausewitz-meets-cezanne-mastery-and-the-art-of-future-war/)

      <title>AI Implementation: The View From the Trenches</title>
      <description>Dan Faggella, who for ten years has interviewed business leaders about the challenges of implementing AI, joins ChinaTalk to discuss about just how hard it is to get AI to diffuse across an economy.
We also get into:

Why the past ten years of AI hasn't lived up to its promise

The technological, bureaucratic, and cultural challenges of corporate AI diffusion

Which sectors are most and least likely to adopt quickly

      <title>Jeff Ding on US vs China AI and Lessons from Past Industrial Revolutions</title>
      <description>Jeff Ding is the leading US scholar on China and AI and author of one of the earliest China-focused Substacks, ChinAI.
He recently published a fire paper called, “The diffusion deficit in scientific and technological power: re-assessing China’s rise.” It makes the argument that diffusion capacity (not just innovation capacity) is critical to economic growth — and China actually fares much worse in diffusion capacity than mainstream narratives imply.
In particular, “In cases when the emerging power has a strong innovation capacity but weak diffusion capacity (diffusion deficit), it is less likely to sustain its rise than innovation-centric assessments depict. Conversely, when the emerging power possesses a strong diffusion capacity but weak innovation capacity (diffusion surplus), it is more likely to sustain its rise than innovation-centric assessments portray.”
Mainstream narratives, meanwhile, “only compare the U.S. and China’s ability to produce new innovations, neglecting their ability to effectively use and adopt emerging technologies. By revealing the gap between China’s innovation capacity and diffusion capacity, this paper argues that innovation-centric assessments mistakenly inflate China’s S&amp;T power.”

      <title>Crafting A National Tech Strategy and Reviving Net Tech Assessment</title>
      <description>PJ Maykish, Abigail Kukura, and Will Moreland from the Future Technologies platform team of the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) join the conversation to discuss critical technologies and the development of a national technology strategy.
The guests provide insights into how the United States can create a comprehensive technology strategy that prioritizes the development of critical technologies to compete with China. They also discuss the importance of international collaboration in the development of emerging technologies and the challenges faced in building consensus among different stakeholders.
This is the paper we primarily discuss: Platforms-Panel-IPR.pdf (scsp.ai)
Vishnu Kannan of Carnegie cohosts.
Midjourney art: the prompt is "A Bauhaus poster for a production of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Featuring a young man looking out from a turret on a castle out towards the sea" but I thought it has a bit of a tech forecasting vibe!

      <title>Hoover, Communism, and the FBI</title>
      <description>J. Edgar Hoover was a controversial figure who served as the director of the FBI for nearly five decades. In this episode, we explore his life and legacy with Beverly Gage, a professor of 20th-century U.S. history and author of the Bancroft Prize-winning biography "G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century."
We discuss

The context in which Hoover developed his anti-communist worldview, and how this shaped his approach to law enforcement.

The deportation of anarchists to Bolshevik Russia.

Similarities between Hoover and Xi Jinping.

The role of FBI informants, including one who met with Mao Zedong.


Outro music: G-Man Hoover by Van Dyke Parks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E566LbON5QA

      <title>Schell on The Long Arc of US-China and Long Reach of Leninism</title>
      <description>How did Xi Jinping’s formative years influence how he views the world today? Veteran China scholar Orville Schell, the Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations, looks back at decades of writing and working on China, weathering the cycles of the country opening up and shutting down and gives his two cents on what’s going on in Xi’s head.
We also discuss
—  Why Mao Zedong is a better read than Xi
— China’s reciprocity problem on the international stage
— How US officials reacted to Tiananmen in a secret meeting with Deng Xiaoping
— A history of accessing China for academics, businesspeople and journalists
— Xi and victim culture

      <itunes:summary>How did Xi Jinping’s formative years influence how he views the world today? Veteran China scholar Orville Schell, the Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations, looks back at decades of writing and working on China, weathering the cycles of the country opening up and shutting down and gives his two cents on what’s going on in Xi’s head.
We also discuss
—  Why Mao Zedong is a better read than Xi
— China’s reciprocity problem on the international stage
— How US officials reacted to Tiananmen in a secret meeting with Deng Xiaoping
— A history of accessing China for academics, businesspeople and journalists
— Xi and victim culture

Outro Music: Glenn Gould performing Contrapunctus, I, IV from Bach’s amazing Art of the Fugue https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqDCieiDWAE

      <title>Roach on US-China Couples Therapy</title>
      <description>Stephen Roach is a Yale professor with extensive experience in China. He also taught the first China class I ever took, so it may be fair to say he's partially to blame for the entire ChinaTalk enterprise.
In our conversation (taped on February 23), we discuss:

The nexus between US-China relations and the DSM-5 (we need some relationship therapy!);

How false narratives strangle effective diplomatic development;

What Stephen thinks about the odds of a hot conflict over Taiwan;

Practical proposals to improve the bilateral relationship, including what a “US-China Secretariat” (based in neutral Tahiti, obviously) would look like;

Is it the US or China — or both — who fundamentally has no interest in engagement?


Apologies for my audio quality in the second half of the show.

      <title>AI Military Competition: Tactical, Operational, and Strategic Implications</title>
      <description>Paul Scharre, Vice President and Director of Studies at CNAS, joins ChinaTalk to discuss AI, military, strategy, and US-China geopolitics.
Listen in for a discussion on:

How AI will impact the tactical, operational and strategic levels of war

How and why AI operates — whether in chess, Dota 2, or aerial dogfighting — in fundamentally different ways than humans;

Why AI called for a “protective response from the bureaucracy”

The significance of the US’s comparative advantage over China in talent and compute — two of Scharre’s “Four Battlegrounds”;

The dictator’s dilemma, and how advances in AI will challenge the CCP in the coming years;

When in China, how to interview like a pro!


Outro music: a missy elliot + spice girls mix from Arthi, a UK-based DJ who's also an economics correspondent for the times of london! https://youtu.be/iHkfmwy1-OI?t=252
Paul’s latest bestseller: https://www.amazon.com/Four-Battlegrounds-Power-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0393866866

      <title>Chips Avengers 2023: Chips Act + AI Revolution</title>
      <description>The Chips Avengers assemble once again! Reva Goujon of the Rhodium Group, JP Kleinhans of the European think tank SNV, Jay Goldberg of Digits and Dollars, and Dylan Patel, who writes SemiAnalysis.
In this episode of ChinaTalk, we all:

Deep dive into the CHIPS Act's recent Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO);

Discuss the potentially existential impact of AI on global power dynamics;

Consider the true intentions of the October 2022 export controls — from military constraining China to crippling manufacturing in the broader economy;

Muse about the potential for a "splinternet" to emerge as countries around the world — in particular, the US, China, EU members states — adopt different standards and regulations for their tech industries;

And more!

      <title>Kotkin on China</title>
      <description>Stephen Kotkin is a legendary historian, currently at Hoover, previously at Princeton. Best known for his Stalin biographies, his other works include Uncivil Society, Magnetic Mountain, and Armageddon Averted.
Our discussion on China is far-ranging yet in-depth — we manage to pack in:

The two dominant subjects taught at the CCP’s Central Party School;

Kotkin’s assessment of the main threat to Communism — what “Communism with a human face” means, and why Gorbachev’s reforms ultimately destroyed Communism in the USSR;

Why the CCP fears color revolutions more than, say, NATO expansion — and why Xi snapped on Hong Kong in 2020;

The twin components of Marxism-Leninism: anti-capitalism + anti-imperialism;

And an understanding of Lenin’s “commanding heights,” and what China’s commanding heights are today;

The case for optimism about US-China relations, despite — or because of — the recent ratcheting up of tensions;

Why Kotkin believes a US-China Cold War is both good and necessary;

How the US can get on the diplomatic “front foot”;

Making sense of Reagan’s foreign policy — how he was both a “movement conservative” and a “dealmaking conservative.”

And an understanding of Lenin’s “commanding heights,” and what China’s commanding heights are today;

The case for optimism about US-China relations, despite — or because of — the recent ratcheting up of tensions;

Why Kotkin believes a US-China Cold War is both good and necessary;

How the US can get on the diplomatic “front foot”;

Making sense of Reagan’s foreign policy — how he was both a “movement conservative” and a “dealmaking conservative.”

        <![CDATA[<p>Stephen Kotkin is a legendary historian, currently at Hoover, previously at Princeton. Best known for his Stalin biographies, his other works include <em>Uncivil Society</em>, <em>Magnetic Mountain</em>, and <em>Armageddon Averted</em>.</p><p>Our discussion on China is far-ranging yet in-depth — we manage to pack in:</p><ul>
<li>The two dominant subjects taught at the CCP’s Central Party School;</li>

      <title>The CIA’s China Capabilities</title>
      <description>Dennis Wilder returns to ChinaTalk — this time with some broader thoughts on how the US intelligence community can rise to the occasion vis-à-vis China. In particular, we discuss:

The importance of government hiring those with experience living in China;

Contributions that the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service (FBIS) has made to China intelligence, and why it should be reinstated;

A serious request to make an ChatGPT as good as Alice Miller is at analyzing CCP documents; https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/clm57-am-final.pdf

Why the State Department has established China House and the CIA has established the China Mission Center;

What we can learn from Richard Danzig’s Driving in the Dark; https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/driving-in-the-dark-ten-propositions-about-prediction-and-national-security%C2%A0

How to maintain robust intelligence capabilities in the long-run;

Raymond P. Ludden and the “Dixie Mission” — and why the US needs more Luddens today. https://uschinadialogue.georgetown.edu/essays/we-need-more-luddens

      <title>Economic Warfare: Implications for Sanctions Today</title>
      <description>Welcome back to the second part of my conversation with Nick Mulder and Lars Schönander.
Picking the narrative up in 1935, get real in this episode:

Why the Great Depression, counterintuitively, made importing commodities cheaper, and how that affected Germany’s and Japan’s protectionism;

The difference between autarky and autarchy;

Whether Kim Jong-un’s North Korea could survive a full-on fuel embargo today by using Nazi-era technology;

Nick’s definition of “temporal claustrophobia,” and what it has to do with Japan ultimately siding with the Axis;

Parallels between the “ABCD circle” (America, Britain, China, Dutch East Indies) and the semiconductor export controls today;

Why having an empire was a liability for Britain;

What sanctions had to do with the Czechoslovaks — even with a larger army — falling to the Nazis;

How the blockades of WWI differed from WWII;

And what lessons pro-decouplers should learn from this history of sanctions.


Nick’s book recommendations:

      <title>Economic Warfare: A History</title>
      <description>Today we’re releasing part one of our a two-part conversation with Nick Mulder, a history professor at Cornell and author of The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War — a Foreign Affairs Best Book of 2022.
With cohost Lars, Schönander, we discuss:

The recent advent of the use of sanctions (for example, in the Crimean War, Britain continued to fulfill payments to Russia, the nation it was fighting right then!)

Why Europeans were reluctant to employ blockades and sanctions in the early twentieth century, and how their thinking evolved through two world wars

How Wilson’s notion of “moral sanctions” and decision to keep blockades in place after the war were important to the development of sanctions, especially during the interwar period

The League of Nations’ efforts to establish a “positive sanctions” fund, and why the concept never took off

Nick’s take on why Hoover is underrated

When and why Italy almost fought a war against Germany over Austria


Stay tuned for part two, when we connect this sanctions history to implications to US-China relations today!

      <title>Will Xi Give Putin Arms? Has A Cold War Already Begun?</title>
      <description>Today we’re going to do a show about the scariest US-China news story I’ve seen in years, that “The US has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine.”
Would China really arm Russia, and if so what will that mean for the world if the US and China end up on opposite sides of a proxy war?
To discuss this I have on today Georgetown’s, Dennis Wilder, a longtime CIA veteran who served as an NSC director on the China desk under the bush administration and spent six years under Obama editing the presidential daily brief before concluding his career in government as the CIA’s deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific.

      <title>AI's Regulatory Future in the US, China, and EU</title>
      <description>With AI on the verge of transforming the world, how are regulators across the globe approaching the challenges the technology might pose?
Also, what does US-China AI collaboration look like today, and will it get caught up in broader tensions in the relationship?
Matt Sheehan and Hadrien Pouget, who are both at Carnegie, come on to discuss.

      <title>Mechanical Keyboards in China （中文版）</title>
      <description>Hey ChinaTalk listeners, this year we’re going to do something new—occasional episodes in Mandarin!
While getting mainland guests to talk about more conventional topics like US-China relations and export controls has been nearly impossible, I think doing more slice of life/business stories about odd corners of China in the pale imitation of Gushi FM is both fun and enriching to our coverage.
In this episode, you’ll hear from the founder of mechanical keyboard manufacturer Meletrix, Simba Hua, about why people like to make their own keyboards, the challenges and wonders of working with the Chinese keyboard supply chain, and customer preferences between East Asian and western keyboard fans.
Cohosting with me is Irene Zhang, one of ChinaTalk’s editors. You can find more of her writing, and more ChinaTalk in general, on our newsletter at https://www.chinatalk.media/. And if you can’t understand Chinese, not to worry, we’ll be running a translated transcript later this month on the newsletter!

      <title>How YOU Can Change S&amp;T Policy</title>
      <description>How does one organization turn expert knowledge into real policy change? Dan Correa, CEO of the Federation of American Scientists and Founder of the Day One Project, discusses the power of policy entrepreneurship and shares examples of the ideas his nonprofit helped turn into legislation. 
We'll delve into the nitty-gritty of policymaking and explore topics such as:

How to make meetings with government officials more productive. 

The importance of pre-work in preparing good ideas and the role experts can play in shaping policy. 

Why it's sometimes better to focus on practical solutions rather than comprehensive strategies.

 Why think tanks always feel the need to create comprehensive, hundred-page strategies.

      <title>Tech Policy Entrepreneurship + Chips Act + Talent Policy</title>
      <description>What do we talk about when we talk about tech policy? What are the weird corners of the chips and science bill? How is talent policy broken and what can anyone do about it? And broadly, if you want to change the world through better regulatory and executive action, how do you go about this?
To discuss all that we have Divyansh Kaushik, a newly minted PhD from Carnegie Mellon currently at the Federation for American Scientists focusing on emerging tech policy. He was also closely involved with the chips and science bill negotiations. 
We talk about
- How to talk to lawmakers and share your thoughts on legislation
- The complex visa system for foreign workers in the US
- The thousands of green cards that never get used.

      <title>AI Compute 101: The Geopolitics of Giant Models</title>
      <description>Love it or hate it, AI capabilities continue to advance. As futurists imagine how this technology may one day be used, how it develops and who will be able to access AI tools will also depend on who funds AI projects and what hardware will be needed to get it to work.
Lennart Heim is a researcher at the Center for the Governance of AI and the author of a fantastic AI compute syllabus primer, which I have just spent the past few weeks obsessed with. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DF31DIkwS9GONzmy1W3nuI9HRAwSKy8JcIbzKYXg-ic/edit?usp=sharing
Joining as co-host is Chris Miller, author of the FT business book of the year Chip War - The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology.
We discuss:

How much does it cost to develop an AI system?

The competition for access to specialized AI chips.

Whether investing heavily in large AI models is financially viable.

Chip smuggling versus cocaine smuggling.

      <title>War in Taiwan: Who Would Win?</title>
      <description>China v Taiwan: who would win? Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research at Brookings. He specializes in U.S. defense strategy, the use of military force, and American national security policy.
We discuss

The limits of scenarios that predict the outcome of a China-Taiwan conflict.

What are intercontinental rail guns?

How sports teams that play each other in the same year can have different outcomes - and what this says about predictability.

Given all this, what’s the point of modelling exercises?

      <title>China's Data Policy Future</title>
      <description>This episode is sponsored by Policyware. Check out Samm's class at https://www.policyware.org/chinatalk
How do Chinese cyber laws and regulations affect multinational companies, and US-China relations? Samm Sacks of Yale Law School walks us through the latest developments in this arena — we discuss:

Why Chinese data policy has been on front-page news in the past few years;

What China is hoping to gain from its new laws and regulations;

The status of TikTok negotiations, and the prospects of a deal given today’s political climate;

How the US and China can — yet sometimes don’t — leverage their data policy infrastructure against one another.

      <title>Knowledge and AI with a Rabbi and Substacker</title>
      <description>As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, we consider the question of whether there are limits to what computers can know and how this compares to human understanding.
Joining me on this episode is Sam Hammond, the director of social policy at the Niskanen Center, and Zohar Atkins, a rabbi and host of the podcast "Meditations with Zohar."
We discuss

The impact of AI on creativity and human thought.

Fears around AI and the centralization of power.

The potential for AI to have an egalitarian effect on closing innate and environmental differences such as education and access to information.

Whether the creative class will be automated out of their jobs.

Outro music: Genesis by Daniela Adrade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJ6KNhA9QY

      <title>Nuclear Fusion: Why We Can't Have Nice Things</title>
      <description>Today US Department of Energy Secretary Granholm announced a nuclear fusion breakthrough at Livermore Labs. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going to be getting commercially viable fusion reactors anytime soon.
Economist Eli Dourado wrote in a piece today: “Nuclear fusion has long been hailed as the next great energy source, capable of providing nearly limitless power without the harmful emissions and waste associated with other forms of energy generation. This week, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced that it had achieved “ignition,” which occurs when the energy output from plasma in a fusion reactor exceeds the energy put into the plasma. With continued investment from government and the private sector, we are likely to see many such scientific milestones reached in the next few years.  
it is important to be wary. Many of these milestones have little bearing on the commercial viability of nuclear fusion. Despite the press releases, the National Ignition Facility conducts weapons tests, not clean-energy research. There is no realistic path from the kind of fusion being celebrated this week to any sort of commercial project. To a lesser extent, that may also be true of progress that we’re seeing in other fusion projects, even commercial ones.”
In the 1970s, many thought we were only a few years away from fusion, but here we are today still burning oil, gas and coal. To explore why, I wanted to repost a fantastic episode of a podcast from a friend of the show. Ben Reinhardt is the host of the Idea Machines podcast, a show that explores innovation systems from history and today. In this episode, Ben interviews Stephen Dean, who was present at the creation of America’s investment in fusion in the mid-70s and has been working in the space ever since. It’s a fascinating exploration of how government-funded science can fail us. Ben Reinhardt is also the creator of PARPA, a private sector DARPA aiming to “unlock robust technology to open new frontiers” which you can check out at parpa.org. This show was recorded in 2021.
Here's the link to the plan discussed in the podcast: https://fire.pppl.gov/us_fusion_plan_1976.pdf

      <title>Can the US and China work together on anything?</title>
      <description>Can the US and China play nicely enough with each other to not ruin the planet in the coming century? In particular, what prospects are there for cooperation around global challenges and biotech? For this episode, I'm joined by Scott Moore, Penn's director of China programs and strategic initiatives and perhaps the nicest person on China Twitter.
We discuss

Medical cooperation between China and the US during the Ebola outbreak.

Whether shared global challenges can be combatted without China.

Leapfrogging as a means of developing technologically versus innovation.

The scariest things that could happen as a result of biotech research.

      <title>Export controls for AI: Will they work?</title>
      <description>Do export controls work? And will they work for AI? Meet Emily Weinstein and Tim Hwang. They're research fellows at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) and have written a paper on the goals of export controls and whether what the US government is trying to achieve with them is clear.
We discuss

Did the US inadvertently help China make better missiles?

How export controls have hurt some US industries' international competitiveness.

What export controls can - and can't - do to prevent technology from being developed abroad.

Important questions about the management of bowling alleys and churches.


Here's the paper we discussed: https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/decoupling-in-strategic-technologies/

      <title>US-China Chip War</title>
      <description>What will the Biden administration's new export controls mean for the US and Chinese semiconductor industries as well as the future of the US-China relationship?
To discuss, I assembled the Chips Avengers, consisting of Reva Goujon (Rhodium Group), Jay Goldberg (Digits to Dollars), Doug O'Laughlin (Fabricated Knowledge), and Martin Chorzempa (PIIE). We got into

The second-order implications of the Biden Administration's moves for industry

What it would take for China to circumvent these controls

How Beijing might strike back

How the regulations could impact the risk of war

      <title>How AI is Unlocking Creativity</title>
      <description>The AI revolution in art is coming, not in decades but months and years. What does this mean for creativity and how will it change the way artists work?
Meet Campfire creative director Steve Coulson. He recently produced an entire comic book using images created by the midjourney AI art generator. Together with my brother Phil Schneider cohosting, we discuss:


Whether using tech to generate art is taking money from already struggling artists

How AI will end the stock photography industry

Why Xi Jinping is banned on midjourney

How young artists can get a leg up by learning to use AI

The challenge of using AI generator tools when you don't speak English


Check out Steve's comic Summer Island here: https://campfirenyc.com/summer-island/

Outro music: Antonio Vivaldi "Vedro con mio diletto" from Il Giustino by Jakub Józef Orliński (counter-tenor) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF4YXv6ZIuE

      <title>Life in Mao's China</title>
      <description>What was life actually like for people in rural China over the last seventy years?
Brew up a nice cup of tea and find a comfy armchair, it's time for another special edition of ChinaTalk. In this episode, Stanford University graduate student Vivian Zhong tells the story of her grandfather's life, from his childhood in the early days of the People's Republic to today pieced together from conversations they've shared over the years.
She talks about:

What it was like being a student in provincial China

Days long trips down the Yangtze

Why you shouldn't date in college

How her grandfather came to hate sweet potatoes


Outro music: Pengyou 朋友 by Emil Chau 周华健 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxaA94HGo9A

      <title>EMERGENCY PODCAST: New Tech Export Controls with Kevin Wolf</title>
      <description>The US Commerce Department just dropped 100+ pages of new export control regulations that have the potential to reshape the future of the global semiconductor industry. But will these regs stop China from getting below 14nm? Is that a goal even worth pursuing? Are they really enforceable? And what are the tradeoffs baked into taking a unilateral vs multilateral approach?
To discuss, I have on today Kevin Wolf, partner at the law firm Akin Gump and former BIS official with thirty years' experience in the field, to explain what it all means. We recorded this show Sunday October 9th.
Cover art was created by midjourney with the prompt: "cyberpunk bureaucrat managing an export control regime"
I could not find any good supercomputer music so this week's outtro music is a puerto rican banger by Mora and Jhay Cortez, perhaps reflecting the emotions MIIT employees are feeling at the moment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgyn7_e9ReQ
The views I express in this show do not reflect those of my employer the Rhodium Group.

      <title>Paul Kennedy's Jonathan Spence Memories</title>
      <description>Prepare a nice cup of tea and put your feet up for a special episode of stories and anecdotes about the late American historian and Sinologist Jonathan Spence, as told by his friend and colleague Paul Kennedy.
He takes us through

Why the worst thing about being stationed in Germany was the drunk British soldiers

Conversations about Chinese history with Henry Kissinger

How archaeological digs win you contracts with provincial governments

Spence's approach to research and scholarship


Outro Music: 'This Map' from the opera The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci (!!!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71cJopakfAw
Here's a video recording of the whole opera: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_susz11wE9Q

      <title>AI and the Future of War</title>
      <description>AI safety is having a moment. To discuss why AI safety matters for national security, today I have on Paul Scharre (@Paul_scharre). He’s the Vice President and Director of Studies at CNAS. He previously served in OSD Policy and as a US Army Ranger.
We discuss

What the future of war looks like as militaries around the world adopt AI technologies

Why using AI in warfare isn't as easy as people think

How supply chains can be used as a form of arms control

Historical weapons so horrible people simply didn't use them

How to get a job at CNAS (they're hiring at cnas.org/careers)


Outro music: A.I. 爱 by 王力宏 Wang Leehom, a very much cancelled Taiwanese pop star https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4DuqEL0ChQ.

      <title>Industrial Policy for Biotech?</title>
      <description>Does America need an industrial policy to compete in biotech?
Today I'm joined by two guests, Ryan Fedasiuk (@RyanFedasiuk) and Gigi Gronvall (@ggronvall). Ryan is a fellow currently on leave from Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Gigi is a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
We discuss:

The growing uses of biotechnology

Biotech security in China and the US

How biotech students can be better supported

Whether Dwight Schrute was right about the value of beets all along

      <title>Moneyball and US State Department</title>
      <description>Wouldn't it be nice to have a world where important policy decisions were decided based on evidence and data rather than narratives and turf battles? Dan Spokojny thought so too, and that's why he's the founder of fp21, a think tank dedicated to changing the processes and institutions of US foreign policy.
Along with Jon Bateman, a senior fellow in the technology and international affairs program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in this episode we talk about some of the failings of contemporary foreign policy decision making processes and what can be done to fix them, including:

How to bring more rigor to making policy decisions

Why the current system loves a good storyteller

What sort of training future foreign policy makers should be getting - but aren't

A few weeks back, Congress actually did something, passing the Chips and Science Act. Most of you have probably heard of the billions going toward subsidizing domestic manufacturing, but a far less-heralded part of the bill may end up matting more in the long run. The Act created the ‘National Semiconductor Technology Center.’ What is it and why does it matter?
To discuss, Eric Breckenfeld of the Semiconductor Industry Association and Hassan Khan, who holds a PhD in engineering and public policy, join the show.

      <title>Bo Xilai: Ten Years On</title>
      <description>This year marks ten years since Wang Lijun's fateful flight to the US Embassy in Chengdu, a decision which set in motion a chain of events that ultimately brought down one of China's most powerful politicians, Xi's most credible rival for power in 2012, Bo Xilai.
The former mayor of Chongqing remains in prison to this day for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of office, along with his wife Gu Kailai, who is serving life imprisonment for the murder of a British businessman. But a decade later, how much of an impact does Bo's story have in the halls of power?
New York Times reporter Chris Buckley joins the show this episode to discuss Bo's legacy and share anecdotes about his encounters with him prior to his arrest, along with formerly Chongqing-based author Xujun Eberlein. Former ChinaTalk producer Alex Boyd co-hosts.
We discuss

Bo's rise to power in Dalian and his move to Chongqing

How Chongqing's man-on-the-street viewed Bo during his tenure - and after

The similarities and differences between Bo and Xi Jinping

Where is Bo now?

      <itunes:summary>This year marks ten years since Wang Lijun's fateful flight to the US Embassy in Chengdu, a decision which set in motion a chain of events that ultimately brought down one of China's most powerful politicians, Xi's most credible rival for power in 2012, Bo Xilai.
The former mayor of Chongqing remains in prison to this day for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of office, along with his wife Gu Kailai, who is serving life imprisonment for the murder of a British businessman. But a decade later, how much of an impact does Bo's story have in the halls of power?
New York Times reporter Chris Buckley joins the show this episode to discuss Bo's legacy and share anecdotes about his encounters with him prior to his arrest, along with formerly Chongqing-based author Xujun Eberlein. Former ChinaTalk producer Alex Boyd co-hosts.
We discuss

Bo's rise to power in Dalian and his move to Chongqing

How Chongqing's man-on-the-street viewed Bo during his tenure - and after

The similarities and differences between Bo and Xi Jinping

Where is Bo now?

      <title>Elite Power Struggles in the CCP and USSR</title>
      <description>I HAVE A NEWSLETTER! Check it out!
Joseph Torigian’s “Prestige, Manipulation and Coercion, Elite Power Struggles in The Soviet Union and China After Stalin and Mao” is in pole position for my best China book of 2022. Books that deeply engage with both Soviet and CCP primary sources around elite politics basically never come out nowadays. I for one am deeply grateful that Joe, one of the few folks on the planet with the training, language skills, and motivation to this sort of work, was able to produce this book.
Joe puts forward convincing revisionist interpretations of Khrushchev’s triumph after Stalin’s death, had me reconsider my conception of the Gang of 4 after Mao’s death, and made me feel for Hua Guofeng getting done dirty by Deng. His new model of how power transitions really work in authoritarian countries with weak institutions left me more scared than hopeful for whatever happens once Xi exits stage left.
Cohosting with me is Lizzi, a video journalist at Wall Street TV, a New York-based independent Chinese language media outlet focusing on Chinese politics and economics.

      <title>Lessons from American Sovietology</title>
      <description>When Churchill announced in 1946 that an iron curtain had descended over Europe, the US government only employed two dozen experts on the Soviet Union. Two years later, with the cold war well underway, the CIA only had 12 Russian speakers.
Over the following decades, philanthropists and the US government started an intellectual mobilization that had profound effects on the course of the cold war. To talk about this, David Engerman, author of Know Your Enemy: The Rise and Fall of America's Soviet Experts, joins the show along with cohosts Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts, and Sam George, who just finished a masters in East Asian studies at Stanford.

We discuss:

How America created a cadre of Sovietologists.

What their impact was on US policy.

Why the experiment ultimately failed.

What lessons the story has for contemporary area studies and China studies in particular.


Outro music: We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTLKWw542g

      <title>How Abe Reshaped Japan (Repost)</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b775</link>
      <description>In light of Abe's assassination, I thought it would be worthwhile to reflect on the man and his legacy.
Last year I recorded an episode discussing Abe Shinzo, second only to Xi as the most consequential East Asian politician of the 21st century. Tobias Harris of the Center for American Progress joined to discuss his new biography of Abe,  The Iconoclast.
Tobias and I discussed

His dramatic rise, fall, and rise again to power

How he reshaped governance in Japan through bureaucratic reform

How he managed relations with the US and China

How tasty his wife's Izakaya is

      <title>How corruption works in China</title>
      <description>I'm off getting married/honeymooning for the next couple of weeks so in my absence please enjoy this fine ChinaTalk vintage.
How can China be so corrupt and yet grow so fast? What's the relationship between corruption and competent governance? How does 'access money' at the higher levels differ from the "profit-sharing" you see lower down in the bureaucracy? How does China in the 21st century compare with America's gilded age? And why won't anyone give me dinosaur eggs?
To discuss, Prof. Yuen Yuen Ang joins the show to talk about her fantastic new book, China's Gilded Age.
The incredible propaganda rap song feat. Xi Jinping here.

      <description>Mister Softee, the famed northeastern American ice cream brand, in Suzhou, China? Yes, that was a thing. Turner Sparks, rising from humble beginnings as just another English teacher making his way in the world, achieved fame and fortune thanks to a catchy jingle and some tasty mango-flavored soft serve. Yet his vision of China-wide ice cream domination dissolved amid a deluge of backstabbing regulators, slashed tires, and stolen cones. Listen here to learn about the circumstances that finally melted Turner’s ice cream dream.

      <title>Beijing to Britain: China in the UK's halls of power</title>
      <description>From then-PM David Cameron knocking back pints with Xi at the local pub to the Chinese ambassador being banned from Parliament: how has China's relationship with the UK changed since the so-called Golden Era?
This week we have on Sam Hogg (@BeijingToBrit), the recently unmasked writer behind the Substack Beijing to Britain. Co-hosted by ChinaTalk's editor and crypto journalist Callan Quinn (@Quinnishvili).

We discuss

The decline of the UK-China relationship

UK attitudes and policy towards Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan

The building up of Chinese expertise within Parliament and the government

Confucius Institutes, higher education and Liu Xiaoming's foot fetish


Outro music: Shook Ones Part 2 by Mobb Deep https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTKpYJ80OVQ

      <title>US-China Tech Relations: A Guide for the Perplexed</title>
      <description>Where should US-China tech relations go? What should “Competitive when it should be. Collaborative when it can be. Adversarial when it must be” actually mean in practice?
To discuss, on this episode we have John Bateman, a newly minted senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and my Rhodium colleague Charlie Vest as co-host.
We get into
- Analyzing the China tech threat and current tech policy
- US public strategy on China and tech and why it’s not very clear.
- How LCD panels made it onto the list of critical tech in mid-nineties but mobile phones didn’t. 
- Why it’s so difficult for intelligence analysts to assess and predict the behavior of a foreign leader.
 John's report: https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/04/25/u.s.-china-technological-decoupling-strategy-and-policy-framework-pub-86897
What American policymakers read: https://scholars-stage.org/american-policy-makers-do-not-read-books/ 
Outro music: Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues by Bob Dylan, live at Carnegie Hall 1963

      <title>Xinjiang and US Imports: The UFLPA's Regulatory Revolution</title>
      <description>The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will come into force in the US on June, 21, 2022. On this episode, John Foote, a partner and the head of the customs practice at Kelley Drye &amp; Warren, discusses the ins and out of what it will mean for companies importing to the US.
We also get into:
- The legal history of preventing goods produced by forced labor from being imported to the US.
- How companies could run into supply chain issues if any of their raw materials for goods come from Xinjiang.
- What it means for Chinese entities.
- The difficult appeals process for disputing customs seizures.

      <title>China + Hollywood: are we heading for a divorce?</title>
      <description>China is now the largest market for movies globally, and there have long been whispers about exactly how this impacts Hollywood decisions when it comes to scripts and casting.
This episode I’m joined by Erich Schwartzel, author of Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy, for a deep dive into the world of Chinese cinema, Chinese movies abroad and China in Hollywood.
Along with co-host Irene Liu, a research analyst at Rhodium Group, we get into:

Why the director of Seven Years in Tibet apologized to China 15 years after its release

Which tech giant has a minority stake in Steven Spielberg’s production company

Whether Richard Gere is unhireable

Why the Kenyan official responsible for importing films loves Chinese ones

The American movies makers involved in Wolf Warriors


Irina Nistor, the Romanian translator of Rambo: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/vhs-vs-communism.html.
Chuck Norris vs Communism was a fantastic movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znp1dNaPp3k

      <title>Twilight Struggle: Cold War Lessons for US-China Today</title>
      <description>Hal Brands (@HalBrands), professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, is the author of The Twilight Struggle: What the Cold War Teaches Us about Great-Power Rivalry Today. Along with co-host Emily Jin @ew_jin) of the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), we discuss:

How the US capitalized on Soviet heavy-handedness in the developing world

How technology impacted the broader trajectory of the Cold War

The US’s never-ending cycles of self-confidence and self-doubt

Today’s Sinologists versus Cold War Sovietologists

Why the only person who can stop the war in Ukraine is the one who started it

      <title>How Chinese Ink Painting Survived the CCP</title>
      <description>How did Chinese painting, arguably the elitist of arts, fare during the Cultural Revolution? To discuss ink paintings, socialist realism, oil paintings and the political upheavals that formed their backdrop, I’m joined by artist Arnold Chang and Curator of Chinese Paintings at the MET in NY, Joe Scheier-Dawlberg.
We discuss:

Whether chaotic periods produce the best art

The role of escapism in the creation of Chinese paintings

Painting, the CCP and the four olds

Why so many Chinese paintings have writing on them

Which university exhibited a 12 by 20 foot oil painting of yours truly without prior permission

To discuss ink paintings, socialist realism, oil paintings and the political upheavals that formed their backdrop, I’m joined by artist Arnold Chang and Curator of Chinese Paintings at the MET in NY, Joe Scheier-Dawlberg.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>Whether chaotic periods produce the best art</li>
<li>The role of escapism in the creation of Chinese paintings</li>
<li>Painting, the CCP and the four olds</li>
<li>Why so many Chinese paintings have writing on them</li>
<li>Which university exhibited a 12 by 20 foot oil painting of yours truly without prior permission</li>

      <title>Global Standards: What's the Deal?</title>
      <description>Standards. Who has them? From shipping containers to screws to tech gadgets, how is it that something made in China can have certain attributes identical to another product made by another company half a world away? And why does it matter?
MIT professor and business history JoAnne Yates and Wellesley professor of political science Craig Murphy are the authors of Engineering Rules: Global Standard Setting since 1880. Together with co-host Jacob Feldgoise, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, we talk about how international standards were established at the impact this had on China’s development.
We also discuss

How standardized shipping containers made China’s rise possible 

Why Tim Berners Lee is a benevolent overlord 

Who has the most influence in setting international standards 

Why Europe might be more annoying than China from a US standards perspective

      <title>Shanghai Lockdown + Wang Huning's Unhappy Travels in America + Classics in China</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/wang-hunings-unhappy-travels-in-america</link>
      <description>In 1991, a young Chinese academic published America against America, a look at the contradictions and paradoxes he observed while traveling there. His book was largely forgotten until last year when it went viral for its observations on US cultural decline, becoming a hot topic on Chinese-language forums.
 
It was no less fascinating for who its author was. Wang Huning is today one of the top leaders in the CCP and a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. Freelance journalist Chang Che (@Changxche) sat down to talk with me about the book and what it tells us about Chinese interpretations of US - and Western - culture.

We also discuss


The Shanghai lockdown

Why the teaching of Western classical civilization took off in China...

...But also makes very little mention of religion

The CCP take on the US culture wars and rewriting curriculums

Tong Zhao (@zhaot2005) is a fellow at the Carnegie Center in Beijing who focuses on China’s nuclear program. Co-hosting is Schwarzmann Scholar Raven Witherspoon.

Why China sees NATO as the aggressor and Russia as the victim

Why policy experts’ lack of technical literacy is a big problem

How China understands nuclear deterrence

China’s argument for Putin being a rational actor

Whether there is any hope

      <title>Orgies, US Navy Corruption and The Fall of Fat Leonard</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/the-fall-of-fat-leonard</link>
      <description>In the 2010s, US Navy officers took cash, prostitutes and more from a Malaysian defense contractor known as Fat Leonard. To tell a story that bears more than a hint of resemblance to the Jho Low 1MDB scandal, award-winning journalist Tom Wright (@tomwrightasia) joins me to discuss Fat Leonard’s relationship with the military and how it all came crashing down.

Tom is the host of the podcast series FAT LEONARD, and previously wrote a New York Times bestseller on Jho Low titled Billion Dollar Whale.

We discuss


How Fat Leonard managed to earn millions through US Navy contracts

The fate of the Navy officers who got mixed up with him

The secret orgy recordings now in China’s possession

Which Chinese historical events deserve the Death of Stalin treatment

Outtro music: V - Swizz Beats by Lil Jon feat. Jho Low (unreleased)

Bonus: The song Tom mentions about Jho Low and Leonardo DiCaprio is Check My Steezo by Blind Scuba Divers, from the 22 Jump Street official soundtrack

      <description>Will Germany’s policy changes towards Russia have a knock-on effect on its attitude towards China? To get the view from Germany, I’m joined by Berlin-based Noah Barkin (@noahbarkin), the managing editor of Rhodium Group’s China practice.
We discuss

Whether Europe is pushing China to exercise its influence over Russia

How Ukraine has changed Germany’s attitude towards the military

Why the Polish president had to give new Chancellor Olaf Scholz a shake

The new “democracies versus authoritarians” paradigm


Consider applying to intern at Rhodium! https://rhg.com/job/research-interns-china-practice/

Outro music: 99 Luftballons by Nena https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpu5a0Bl8eY

      <title>Space Industry Literacy, NASA, and Elon versus the Taliban</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/space-industry-literacy</link>
      <description>What’s the point of NASA? Will Starlink end up funding Elon’s Mars dreams? To discuss the US space ecosystem in both the private and public sector, I am joined by Casey Handmer (@CJHandmer), former NASA Jet Propulsion Lab system architect and founder of Terraform Industries.

We also talk about


The potential for Starlink to improve internet access in developing countries

Whether the US immigration system is hurting its ability to attract the best scientists

Making electricity from air

How much it would cost to send me into space

      <title>China's Wolf Warrior Diplomacy, Part 1</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-part-1</link>
      <description>Why has China and its foreign ministry struggled to communicate with the world? In his book, China’s Civilian Army: The Making of Wolf Warrior Diplomacy, Peter Martin (@PeterMartin_PCM) traces the history of China’s post-1949 diplomatic corps, from the impact of Zhou Enlai’s experiences in Paris to reluctant guerrilla-generals-turned-ambassadors trying to get to grips with manning embassies half a world away from Cultural Revolution China.
Along with Schwarzman scholar Jason Zhou, we dissect the international diplomacy up to Kissinger’s visit to China.

      <title>Imperial Japan + Export Controls = Pearl Harbor!?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/imperial-japan-export-controls-pearl-harbor</link>
      <description>What can US-China relations learn from US-Japan relations in the leadup to WWII? To discuss, I’m joined by Stony Brook University’s Michael Barnhart, author of the 1987 Japan Prepares for Total War: The Search for Economic Security, 1919–1941 and the more recent Can You Beat Churchill?: Teaching History through Simulations (https://www.amazon.com/Can-You-Beat-Churchill-Simulations/dp/1501755641), with Scholar’s Stage essayist Tanner Greer (@Scholars_Stage) cohosting.
We discuss

What motivated Japan to invade China

Why FDR was particularly worried about a Japanese invasion of the USSR

Why Japan and the Nazis thought the West would be on their side

The benefits of paying attention to mid level bureaucrats

Qin recruits troops and advances on Zhou to demand the nine cauldrons

East Zhou wishes to grow rice

Gong Ta defects from West Zhou

Zhang Yi runs out of money in Chu

An attack on Zhongshan

The Queen Dowager of Zhao takes over the running of state affairs

      <description>What does the 6th Plenum communique tell us about where Xi wants to take China? What can you learn by reading the People’s Daily daily and writing a substack on it? And how would you design a course to learn how to read the CCP?
To discuss, Manoj Kewalramani (@theChinaDude) of the https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/ and https://manojkewalramani.substack.com/ newsletters, joins to discuss.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/red-roulette-it-sucks-to-be-a-chinese-billionaire</link>
      <description>Red Roulette, Desmond Shum’s memoir of a fast life, deep in the bowels of Chinese politics, is the bombshell China book of 2021. It tells the story of his rise from an impoverished childhood in cultural revolution-era Shanghai and Hong Kong to his marriage to his social climbing wife with ties to the premier of China, and ultimate downfall as Xi’s anti-corruption push caught up with him. 
New York Times reporter Mike Forsythe (@PekingMike) and Lizzi C Lee (@wstv_lizzi), a journalist at the independent Chinese outlet Wall St TV, join me to discuss. We get into:

Corruption crackdowns under Xi Jinping

Western reporters reporting on China

The not-so-well-hidden fortunes of Politburo members

The dietary habits of traveling Chinese officials

      <description>Lisa Porter joins me with Eric Lofgren from AcquisitionTalk as cohost to reflect on how R&amp;D works and doesn't work `in the Pentagon.
Lisa served as was deputy director of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in the DoD, founding director of IARPA, and executive vice president of In-Q-Tel. We touch on:

How the error correction of free markets is absent in DoD

A round of overrated/underrated on critical S&amp;T areas

How successful government organizations empower their staff

Why the US lost its dominance in space launch

      <title>Mao and the Monkey King</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/mao-and-the-monkey-kingpublic</link>
      <description>Julia Lovell, author of Maoism: A Global History and The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams and the Making of China, discusses translating Journey to the West (https://www.amazon.com/Monkey-King-Journey-Classics-Hardcover/dp/0143107186), for English audiences.
Joined by translator Brendan O'Kane as co-host, on this episode we discuss:

The origins of Journey to the West and the exploits of its primate protagonist Sun Wukong.

Mao's relationship to the novel and how he saw himself in the Monkey King.

Why performances of the story in the Mao era cut out more than 90% of the story

      <title>Russia's Pivot to Asia From Czars to Putin</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/russias-pivot-to-asia-from-czars-to-putin</link>
      <description>How did Russian imperial ambitions and expansionism eastward change over time?
Joining me on this episode is Chris Miller, author of We Shall Be Masters: Russian Pivots to East Asia from Peter the Great to Putin. Chris is a history professor at the Fletcher School and Eurasia Director at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
Cohosting is independent researcher, journalist and fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute Kamil Galeev. Reach out to him on twitter if you have a place for him to live in DC!
We also look at:

How the fur trade spurred Russian interest in Alaska, California and Hawaii

Russia, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

Why Xinjiang didn’t end up like Mongolia

Chairman Mao’s new shoes


Outtro music: Kamil's suggestion of what he tells me was a Soviet anti-Japanese war song (it slaps)

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/tooze-and-klein-on-chinas-economic-history-and-future</link>
      <description>How much credit can the CCP claim post-1949 for the higher level of human development relative to the level of visible capital in China? To discuss, historian Adam Tooze and Matt Klein of the Overshoot come for their third ChinaTalk appearance. We go back to the oft-forgotten hyperinflation of the 1940s to why in the 80s the World Bank believed a little bit of policy tinkering would lead China’s economy to skyrocket.

      <title>BadChinaTake on China Twitter</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/badchinatakes-on-china-twitter</link>
      <description>@BadChinaTake, an anonymous twitter account that combined vicious takedowns of, well, bad china takes with a blog https://wokeglobaltimes.com/ that does deep dives into everything from tankie subcultures to China’s xinjiang policy, is one of the best things to hit China twitter. BadChinaTake was recently unmasked as Jake Eberts, a young DC-based China analyst. He joins us today to talk about his journey to twitter infamy. We get into

Whether the CIA, Chinese government, or George Soros fund him

Crisis, danger and opportunity

Whether you should argue with children online

The DC think tank complex and China Twitter’s redeemable qualities

      <title>Hot Space Summer: China's Commercial Space Boom</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/chinas-commercial-space-boom</link>
      <description>In 2019, Thomas Colvin, Irina Liu and Shirley Han at the Science and Technology Policy Institute (https://www.ida.org/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute) were part of a team of researchers that published what is to date the most comprehensive English-language overview (https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/e/ev/evaluation-of-chinas-commercial-space-sector) of China’s growing space industry.
We discuss

Why Chinese space startups say business acumen is one of their biggest weaknesses

How ITAR actually helped China’s space industry grow

The space market in the developing world

The state of my internet cables

      <title>Xi: Failed Reformer?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b778</link>
      <description>Why does Xi govern like he's running out of time? Rhodium's Dan Rosen and CSIS' Jude Blanchette discuss their recent Foreign Affairs pieces recapping the past years of Xi's rule from an economic and political perspective. We get into failed financial liberalization, anti-corruption, the prospects for war over Taiwan, lessons from Sputnik, and vertical farming.  
 Dan's FA piece:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-22/chinas-economic-reckoning
 Jude's FA Piece:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-22/xis-gamble

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b77f</link>
      <description>Bell Labs is dead, long live Bell Labs! This week's guest, Ilan Gur, the CEO of Activate.org, has a plan to improve America's R&amp;D apparatus: fund start-ups that allow entrepreneurial researchers to pursue the practical applications of their world-class basic research. We discuss why we're lucky to have Moderna and BioNTech (beyond the obvious reasons), the impact of research moving from corporations to universities, the Endless Frontier Act, why patents don't equal innovation, and more.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b781</link>
      <description>Why hasn’t North Korea emulated Deng’s Opening &amp; Reform? Are China’s wealthy, educated, urbane youth liberals? Could the PLA cooperate with the U.S. military in the event of Korean reunification?
 Dr. Sungmin Cho of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies joins ChinaTalk for a discussion of the Korean Peninsula as viewed by Beijing. This episode is a companion to  this week’s ChinaTalk with Odd Arne Westad. Ainikki Riikonen, a research assistant at Center for a New American Security, joins as today’s co-host. Thanks to CNAS for sponsoring this episode. 
 Read Dr. Cho’s recent article on the joint recovery of fallen soldiers on the Korean Peninsula as a “guardrail to prevent the worsening of” any potential military crisis in the region:  https://apcss.org/nexus_articles/the-joint-recovery-of-fallen-soldiers-from-the-korean-war-one-way-for-american-chinese-north-and-south-korean-soldiers-to-cooperate-and-reconcile/

      <title>600 Years Of Sino-Korean Relations</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b782</link>
      <description>Odd Arne Westad joins ChinaTalk to discuss his latest book Empire and Righteous Nation: 600 Years of China-Korea Relations. Westad’s work is a diplomat’s handbook that connects the sweeping currents of history to the geopolitics of today. Co-hosting today is Danny Crichton of Techcrunch. We explore how Korea, past and present, navigates its relationship with the powerful empires on its doorstep.
 Korea’s unique Confucianism serves as a launching point into a discussion on empire and nation-state that takes us from the Joseon Dynasty’s navigation of the Ming Dynasty’s collapse all the way up to the present day (with snippets on espionage in Qing China, Korea’s own version of the Taiping Rebellion, and Japanese imperialism).
 We end on K-drama’s popularity in Zhongnanhai and how the flow of South Korean pop culture into China might complicate Chinese leaders’ decision to intervene on behalf of the DPRK in a conflict on the peninsula.

      <title>Industrial Policy: How the Green New Deal's Architects Would Do IP</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b783</link>
      <description>For Part Three of ChinaTalk's industrial policy series, we are joined by two leading lights of the American left: Saikat Chakrabarti, AOC's former Chief of Staff, and Zack Exley of the 2016 Bernie campaign. (Don't forget to check out  Part One with Rob Atkinson and  Part Two with José Fernandez.) Co-hosting is Vishnu Kannan, a junior fellow in Carnegie's Technology and International Affairs Program. Saikat and Zack take us inside the creation of the Green New Deal, lay out how bold leadership can change a nation's economic trajectory, lament Democrats' lukewarm appetite for industrial policy, and offer up their vision for an American developmental program that harnesses the full potential of its people and capital. We discuss everything from how Harvard teaches economics wrong to what CIA Director Bill Burn's declassified Iraq War cables have to do with the classic film Casablanca.

      <itunes:summary>For Part Three of ChinaTalk's industrial policy series, we are joined by two leading lights of the American left: Saikat Chakrabarti, AOC's former Chief of Staff, and Zack Exley of the 2016 Bernie campaign. (Don't forget to check out  Part One with Rob Atkinson and  Part Two with José Fernandez.) Co-hosting is Vishnu Kannan, a junior fellow in Carnegie's Technology and International Affairs Program. Saikat and Zack take us inside the creation of the Green New Deal, lay out how bold leadership can change a nation's economic trajectory, lament Democrats' lukewarm appetite for industrial policy, and offer up their vision for an American developmental program that harnesses the full potential of its people and capital. We discuss everything from how Harvard teaches economics wrong to what CIA Director Bill Burn's declassified Iraq War cables have to do with the classic film Casablanca.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b784</link>
      <description>Kevin Xu of the fantastic Interconnected newsletter, and formerly of Commerce and the Obama White House, ran through a grab bag of some of the hottest topics in US-China tech.
 We got into the politics of Tesla in China, what Morris Chang of TSMC thinks about the future of the semiconductor industry, how  open source is key to the future of American industrial policy, why the Endless Frontier Act (which I wrote about in the  most recent edition of the ChinaTalk newsletter) is the most important bill you've never heard of, and why Bytedance's Zhang Yiming deserves his own biopic.

 Thomas Shugart joined me and Eric Lofgren on another cross-over episode of ChinaAcquisitionTalk. Thomas spent 25 years in the US Navy and is currently an adjunct senior fellow at CNAS.
 This possibility is made more dangerous considering the rise of China’s military, particularly in long-range missiles, bombers, and navy. The expansion of the PLA Navy over the last five years as been nearly identical to the legendary 1980s Reagan build-up. “For all the talk of them being next generation swarming and unmanned,” Thomas said, “they sure are bending a lot of iron building ships.”
 You can find some of Tom's writing on his CNAS page, including his War on the Rocks article, All about EVE: What virtual forever wars can teach us about the future of combat. His statement to the US-China economic and security review commission is here. He's on Twitter at  tshugart3.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b786</link>
      <description>Fascinated (or stunned) by China’s recent anti-monopoly moves against tech giants Ant and Meituan? Want to get inside the head of Chinese regulators as they plan their moves against the globe’s largest corporations? ChinaTalk has you covered. This week I’m joined by Dr. Angela Zhang, a professor at The University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Law, to discuss her new book “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism: How The Rise of China Challenges Global Regulation”. Yvonne Yu, my colleague at Rhodium, cohosts. Together we dig deep into the past, present, and future of the Chinese regulatory state.
 Dr. Zhang tweets at @AngelaZhangHK and you can read her work in Nikkei Asia as well:  https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/China-s-Alibaba-probe-is-not-all-bad-news

      <description>What as the rise of streaming, idols, and increased censorship done to Chinese TV?  
 Co-hosting is Ina Yang, one of the founders of the Chinese-language podcast Loud Murmurs. We discuss Chinese dramas with AvenueX, the intrepid YouTuber who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Chinese TV scene. AvenueX explains how the internet changed Chinese dramas (and not always for the better), why China’s censorship system leads to stilted plots (it’s not quite what you’d think), and why Zi Jinchen is the luckiest novelist in China (it’s not his books that made him famous) We also discuss our favorite shows of the past year, and our recommendations for those looking to get started in the world of C-dramas.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b789</link>
      <description>What is Huarong and why do its struggles explain the central contradictions of China's financial system?
 To discuss, Logan Wright of Rhodium joins the show. In the first ten minutes, Logan catches us up on the news of the week. Then in the following hour, I rerun an episode we recorded together in late 2018 discussing his report  Credit and Credibility, which explains why the big one hasn't hit yet.

      <title>Bo Xilai and How Xi Learned from the Chongqing Model</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b78a</link>
      <description>What was the Chongqing Model and why does it still matter?
 Yueran Zhang, a PhD student in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, discusses. We talk about how Bo Xilai utilized mass mobilization against his enemies in the central government and China’s labor movements, and the significance of the 2018 Jasic protests.
 Zhang’s two recent articles for Made In China journal, “The Chongqing Model One Decade On” and “Leninists in a Chinese Factory: Reflections on the Jasic Labour Organizing Strategy,” serve as the basis for today’s episode.
 Outtro music: some pro-Bo Xilai song written in 2009 to commemorate him taking on gangs (full story here:  https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%96%84%E7%86%99%E6%9D%A5%E4%B9%8B%E6%AD%8C) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND6fOAR4MWA 
 While this song is hilarious, I couldn't find a good recording and didn't want to you have to listen to the whole thing. Also thought it would be funny to pair this with folks who idolize gangsters...
 Outtro music #2: GOSH Music 2020 cypher (the biggest Chongqing hip hop collective) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0axMxBSWg

      <title>'Invisible China': How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens China’s Rise</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b78b</link>
      <description>Scott Rozelle (legend, Stanford professor, co-director of the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions) joins ChinaTalk to discuss his recent book Invisible China: How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens China’s Rise, co-authored with Natalie Hell. We discuss how China’s 900 million-strong low-income population will decide China’s future development path. Is China is the next Mexico? Why is it easy to solve poverty but not low income? Why don’t local governments spend enough on rural education and health? How has the relationship between academia and government changed from the Hu Jintao-era to the Xi Jinping-era?

      <title>US-China Ideological Competition</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b78e</link>
      <description>Are the US and China in ideological competition? How does one go about answering that question? Dan Tobin of the US Intelligence Community's National Intelligence University and Ryan Manuel of Official China have a dangerous amount of fun debating guiding ideologies and what they mean for geopolitics.
 Dan's 2020 congressional testimony on CCP ideology:  https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/testimonies/SFR%20for%20USCC%20TobinD%2020200313.pdf
 Ryan's PhD thesis on CCP bureaucracy (which really is fantastic, chapter 3 is an absolute must-read):  https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:84ec884b-9bd7-46d7-a395-f6bf9ba501e0/download_file?safe_filename=RManuel%2BDPhil%2BFINAL.pdf&amp;file_format=application%2Fpdf&amp;type_of_work=Thesis 
 This episode was recorded in late 2020. Dan's views are his own and do not reflect those of the US Government or the NIU.
 The only way I can hope to keep up this two-show/week pace is to pay my fantastic editors to clean up these episodes for you all. Please consider supporting the show at glow.fm/chinatalk.

      <title>Michèle Flournoy on "Affecting the Strategic Calculus"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b790</link>
      <description>Michèle Flournoy joined AcquisitionTalk's Eric Lofgren and me for another crossover episode of China-AcquisitionTalk. Flournoy is a former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, co-founder and new board chair of CNAS (where I'm a fellow), and currently the founder and managing partner of WestExec Advisors. I dove deep into the archive, digging up copies of Flournoy's undergraduate and master's theses to discuss "psycho-social approaches to international relations" and 1980s nuclear policy. We also covered:
  China’s approach to systems destruction warfare
 How to make a compelling case for technologists to join DoD
 Nuclear policy and affecting the strategic calculus
 Whether “legacy” weapons need divestment
 A “Manhattan Project” for AI/ML

Mara Hvistendahl guest hosts an interview with Te-Ping, where we discuss her writing process, journalism versus fiction writing, and some of the stories behind the stories.    Outtro Music: Pocketful of Stars - Shanghai Rainbow Chambers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3z7-1rUYI&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3z7-1rUYI&amp;t=1s</a> "For those people sometimes cannot be understood well by others but still have strong willingness to be understood. Surely, we can also regard that the song is written for everyone. We truly believe that we all have our own zone where we place our little secrets and childlike thoughts and we wish all the goodliness in hearts can sparkle permanently like twinkling stars in the sky."   Please consider supporting ChinaTalk at <a href="https://glow.fm/chinatalk/">glow.fm/chinatalk</a> <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/1959352">Get bonus content on Patreon</a><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>To The Quad! The Origins of "Indo-Pacific"</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b793</link>
      <description>Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australia National University discusses his new book 'Indo-Pacific Empire.'
 We talk 15th-century Korean maps, the promise of the 1947 Asian Relations Conference, Australia and India's shifting conceptions of their place in the region, the origins of the Quad, China-Australia relations, and advice Rory has for the Quad countries as they try to figure out what this 'minilateral' should amount to. 
 Megan Lamberth of CNAS cohosts. Also discussed is Martijn Rasser's report on Tech, Australia and the Quad (https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/networked-techno-democratic-statecraft-for-australia-and-the-quad). 
 Thanks to CNAS for sponsoring this episode. 
 Outtro music, perhaps the most beautiful song featured on ChinaTalk, comes to us via Rory's suggestion. His intro:
 "Bayini, by Australian indigenous singer Gurrumul (who sadly is no longer with us).  Gurrumul performed in New Delhi in 2012 alongside Anoushka Shankar in a concert to celebrate Australia-India relations.  Bayini is a song in an indigenous Australian language, about mythological spirits visiting Northern Australia from across the sea, and is believed to reflect folklore about contact with fishermen from the Indonesian archipelago in pre-colonial times.  So it has a certain Indo-Pacific character to it, of friendship and connection."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoGt1bH20fM
 Alternate outtro music I was going to put on before Rory pitched this one....two Indian rappers and a Chinese-Australian pop star (Wengie &amp; Shalmali - Thing You Want ft. Ikka)

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b794</link>
      <description>Adam Tooze (now on Substack!) and Matt Klein, author of Trade Wars Are Class Wars, return to ChinaTalk and pick up right where they left off in September. 
 We discuss whether Ricardo’s theories of comparative advantage actually work in a globalized age, why Stalin’s embrace of “socialism in one country” was a response to the hegemonic power of British (and American) capital, whether a Bolshevik Revolution is the best way to solve global inequality, how intra-elite conflict drives sovereignty-limiting engagement in international organizations, vaccines, Europe’s carbon markets, Keynes' "bancor", the Strategic Shiraz Reserve, and a whole lot more.

      <title>Beyond Espionage: China's Quest for Foreign Technology</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b797</link>
      <description>Four contributors to the recent book China's Quest for Foreign Technology: Beyond Espionage discuss China’s foreign technology acquisition. Is it nefarious, or just typical behavior of an upwardly mobile nation? Is the myth of a stateless global society dead? And why does such a pressing issue seem invisible in the West?

      <title>Rethinking Industrial Policy...and Everything Else</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b798</link>
      <description>I have a newsletter! If you listen to this podcast I can say with high confidence you'll enjoy it! Do subscribe at https://chinatalk.substack.com/.
 Jose Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente, an independent researcher who runs the blog nintil.com, complicates our previous week's ChinaTalk on US industrial policy with Rob Atkinson. We discuss whether the state invented the iPhone, if the trends of history are pointing Taiwan’s direction, why the way we fund science is broken, what mass conversions to Mormonism would mean for the American economy, and, if you stick around to the end, how to live forever. 
 This episode was brought to you by the Korea Foundation, which has sponsored a series of ChinaTalk episodes supplementing my forthcoming paper coming out next month entitled ‘Labs not Fabs: How the U.S. Should Invest in the Future of Semiconductors’. This research was hosted by the Eurasia Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

      <title>Richard Fontaine on CNAS and US-China</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b79a</link>
      <description>Richard Fontaine, CEO of CNAS, discusses what it's like to run what very well may be the hottest think tank in the Asia policy game (full disclosure: I'm a CNAS adjunct). 
 We get into Biden and Asia and how the new president's foreign policy team will prioritize what they want to get out of the US-China relationship. We also touch on the biggest argument Richard's had with current senior DoD official and former CNAS VP Ely Ratner, what he's learned from looking at China questions with Silicon Valley luminaries, why he'd like to do more faith-centered studies of foreign policy, what fiction he's reading...and if you stick around until the end of the show we get into export controls!

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b79c</link>
      <description>I have a newsletter! If you listen to this podcast I can say with high confidence you'll enjoy it! Do subscribe at https://chinatalk.substack.com/. 
 Rob Atkinson is the president of ITIF, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a non-partisan DC-based think tank. We’re going to discuss US industrial policy grand strategy in light of China’s rise, what the US can expect from its allies on tech policy, as well as the “power trader” paradigm and how Albert Hirschmann’s analysis of 20th century Kaiser and Nazi trade policy helps explain China today.
 This episode was brought to you by the Korea Foundation, which has sponsored a series of ChinaTalk episodes supplementing my forthcoming paper coming out next month entitled ‘Labs not Fabs: How the U.S. Should Invest in the Future of Semiconductors’. This research was hosted by the Eurasia Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

 Rob Atkinson is the president of ITIF, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a non-partisan DC-based think tank. We’re going to discuss US industrial policy grand strategy in light of China’s rise, what the US can expect from its allies on tech policy, as well as the “power trader” paradigm and how Albert Hirschmann’s analysis of 20th century Kaiser and Nazi trade policy helps explain China today.
 This episode was brought to you by the Korea Foundation, which has sponsored a series of ChinaTalk episodes supplementing my forthcoming paper coming out next month entitled ‘Labs not Fabs: How the U.S. Should Invest in the Future of Semiconductors’. This research was hosted by the Eurasia Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

      <title>WWII's Legacy in China with Rana Mitter</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b79d</link>
      <description>Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history at Oxford University, discusses his book from earlier this year,  China’s Good War: How World War II Is Shaping a New Nationalism.
 Now seventy-five years after China’s victory over Japan, China is rethinking how it grapples with the legacy of WWII (see, for example, The Eight Hundred, the highest-grossing film of 2020, discussed towards the end of the show).  Mitter argues that this growing emphasis on World War II is evidence of a subtle rewriting of history, where 1945 takes on a significance comparable to 1949, and the CCP adopts historical victories of the Kuomintang.

      <title>DIU's Michael Brown on US-China Tech Competition</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7a0</link>
      <description>Kicking off a series on US-China defense-related issues with Eric Lofgren of the podcast AcquisitionTalk, we host Defense Innovation Unit head Michael Brown.
 We touch on a number of topics, including:
  Industrial espionage and foreign investment
 The debate over basic vs. applied research
 China starting to determine technical standards
 Coordinating with allies on semiconductors
 Transitioning tech in the DoD
  Before taking the helm of DIU in 2018, Michael co-authored a study with Pravneet Singh showing how Chinese participation in the US venture/tech ecosystem had surged from $300 million in 2010 to $11.52 billion in 2015. Chinese capital comprised 16 percent of all deals in 2016. That work launched the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) which strengthened the government's ability to block Chinese investments.
 Do note we recorded this episode in early Nov before the election.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7a3</link>
      <description>Peter Harrell and Liz Rosenberg, both CNAS fellows, joined ChinaTalk in May to talk about their report authored with Ashley Fung, 'A New Arsenal for Competition: Coercive Economic Measures in the U.S.-China Relationship.'
 We discuss how the Trump administration has refined the use of these policy tools since Liz and Peter served under Obama, do a round overrated/underrated for international economic policy tools, and hear their best tv pilot pitches with sanctions themes.

 Music is some pro-Putin, anti-US sanctions song that has an awful ratio on youtube.

      <title>Wendy Cutler on US-China Trade Policy</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7a4</link>
      <description>Wendy Culter, who served 28 years in the Office of the US Trade Representative, discusses how Biden should address Beijing on trade. We talk about how he could leverage allies' frustration with Chinese behavior and speculate about the future of the WTO. We also debate the merits of a number of my hair-brained trade ideas including the Strategic Shiraz Reserve and a Mutual Trade Defense Pact.

 I spelled out my trade policy ideas in more detail in my newsletter here.  https://chinatalk.substack.com/p/a-strategic-shiraz-reserve-to-help

      <title>5G in the Caribbean, Open Source Tech, CCP Twitter Bots, Chinese TV and Rap</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7a8</link>
      <description>I chatted this week with Rasheed Griffith of the  China in the Caribbean Podcast. I highly recommend you check out his channel!
 We discuss:
  The possible future of US-China tech competition under the incoming Biden Administration
 The nature of China's Twitter influence campaigns and what we can learn about making viral memes from Russian disinformation operators.  See here for my deep dive. 
 Why  open-source software should be the basis for a new US industrial policy and why China is looking to push that same strategy
 What we can learn from good Chinese tv shows
 Why we should all be listening to Chinese rap
  Recommendations: Jordan
  American Mandarin Society 'China Syllabi Project'

      <itunes:subtitle>Crossover ep with the China in the Caribbean Podcast!</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>I chatted this week with Rasheed Griffith of the  China in the Caribbean Podcast. I highly recommend you check out his channel!
 We discuss:
  The possible future of US-China tech competition under the incoming Biden Administration
 The nature of China's Twitter influence campaigns and what we can learn about making viral memes from Russian disinformation operators.  See here for my deep dive. 
 Why  open-source software should be the basis for a new US industrial policy and why China is looking to push that same strategy
 What we can learn from good Chinese tv shows
 Why we should all be listening to Chinese rap
  Recommendations: Jordan
  American Mandarin Society 'China Syllabi Project'

      <title>Incoming NSA Jake Sullivan on an Alternative Vision for US-China Relations</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7a9</link>
      <description>President-Elect Joe Biden just tapped Jake Sullivan to serve as his first National Security Advisor, the most important foreign policy role in the White House. In light of this announcement, I'm rerunning an episode we recorded in late 2019.  Jake Sullivan previously served in the Obama administration as National Security Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden and Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. State Department.
 Check out my newsletter at https://chinatalk.substack.com/. In the most recent edition, I do a deep dive comparing the HR McMaster and Sullivan interviews.
 Do consider supporting this show at https://glow.fm/chinatalk/ if you're enjoying the two episode/week pace I'm currently keeping up.

      <description>HR McMaster was Trump's National Security Advisor and, it seems, a ChinaTalk superfan. We talk about his time in government, what the US missed about China and what to do about it, and which Seinfeld character would make the best NSA.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7ab</link>
      <description>What will a Biden administration foreign policy look like? What’s going to happen on tech and trade? How will debates within the democratic party on what to do about china shake out? Where will congress be on the issue? How will Biden the man impact foreign policy?
 To discuss, we have on the person who has taught me most about American politics,  David F. Gordon, currently a senior advisor at IISS. Previously, he was my boss at the Eurasia Group, served as the director of policy planning under Condoleezza Rice at the State Department, acting chairman of the National Intelligence Council, among many other positions in a multi-decade career in the IC.

      <title>Is a Chinese Financial Crisis Looming?</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7ac</link>
      <description>The Chinese economy is perhaps the world's only economic bright spot. So that means we can stop worrying about a financial crisis, right?
 Think again, according to Lauren Gloudeman and Logan Wright of the Rhodium Group, who join to discuss their  new paper mapping out the weak points in China's financial system.
 That this report is a follow-up to Logan's 2018 paper entitled  Credit and Credibility. Our past show on the topic you can find here on Apple Podcasts and here on Spotify.

 A nation strengthened.
 A nation healed."

 From Philly: Beanie Sigel, Lil Uzi Vert (Tried to fit in Dreams and Nightmares but the lyrics are just too offensive...)
 From Detroit: Eminem, Dej Loaf
 From Minnesota: Justin Vernon

      <title>What To Do About Xinjiang</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7af</link>
      <description>How should the US respond to the human rights crisis in Xinjiang? I was a guest on the Lawfare podcast this week, discussing my recent essay outlining how the U.S. can respond and push back on the Chinese government's abuses in the region. For the first fifteen minutes, I interviewed Sheena Greitens, an associate professor at UT Austin's LBJ School of Public Affairs, on the origins of the camps and Xi's motivation for the current policy. In the second half, Lawfare editor Jacob Schulz and I discuss what the US government should do from legislative, executive and diplomatic angles.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7b3</link>
      <description>Why, aside from Yao, have Chinese players had no success in the NBA? Post-NBA, what has Yao done to reform and professionalize the Chinese Basketball Association? One year on, how does the NBA's response to Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey's tweet look in retrospect, and why has the Chinese government responded so differently to NBA and Premier League stars making noise about Xinjiang?
 Hunter Shi of the podcast 翻转体育 and Nate Duncan of the Dunk'd On Podcast join to discuss.

      <description>How does the Chinese government's S&amp;T spending differ fundamentally from America's and what does that tell us about the nature of their industrial policy? What is China Standards 2035 and what implications could it have? Will China pull the rare earth card? And is there any chance that America doesn't overcorrect?

      <title>Liberalism: The Light That Failed</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7b5</link>
      <description>In his memoir  The World as It Is, Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama’s closest national security aide, confides that, on the day Obama left the White House, the worry that haunted him most was: ‘What if we were wrong?’ That is, what if liberals had misinterpreted the nature of the post-Cold War period?
 ‘What if we were wrong?’ is the question Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes set out to explain in their recent  The Light That Failed: A Reckoning, which takes Eastern Europe as exhibit A. The book meditates on how liberalism lost its appeal and its themes have clear echoes in East Asia. 
 Guest hosting today is Eddie Fishman.

      <title>TikTok, WeChat and Trump</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7b6</link>
      <description>It's been a wild few weeks with President Trump threatening to shut WeChat and TikTok out of the U.S. market and rip them out of the app stores. There have been lawsuits, a preliminary injunction—and a sudden deal to purchase TikTok and moot the issue out. To chew it all over, Benjamin Wittes hosted a discussion with Lawfare co-founder Bobby Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin Law School, and me, Jordan, the voice behind ChinaTalk. We talked about how we got here, whether the threat from these companies is real or whether this is more Trump nonsense, and whether the deal to save TikTok will actually work.

      <title>Adam Tooze on World Order, Then and Now</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7b8</link>
      <description>Adam Tooze is my favorite economic historian. After writing a handful of books on  the 1920s and  Nazi economics, he's now turned his eye to the present day, taking on  the financial crisis and US-China relations. In this conversation, we get into
  What we can learn from the diplomatic and economic modes of 1920s and 30s
 Why Nazi legal theory resonates so well in China today
 How modes of understanding Nazi Germany can help illustrate China
 How Xinjiang camps echo the logic of Soviet gulags
 Whether the US in fact lost the Cold War
 Adam's dream bureaucracies to work it
  Matt Klein, author of the recent Trade Wars are Class Wars, guest hosts. 
 Intro and outtro music are both hit songs from 1928, the year of the Kellogg-Briand Pact which tried to outlaw war.
 Intro music: Pine Top's Boogie Woogie
 Outtro music: Blind Willie McTell, Statesboro Blues

      <description>Mister Softee, the famed northeastern American ice cream brand, in Suzhou, China? Yes, that was a thing.  Turner Sparks, rising from humble beginnings as just another English teacher making his way in the world, achieved fame and fortune thanks to a catchy jingle and some tasty mango-flavored soft serve. Yet his vision of China-wide ice cream domination dissolved amid a deluge of backstabbing regulators, slashed tires, and stolen cones. Listen here to learn about the circumstances that finally melted Turner’s ice cream dream.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7bb</link>
      <description>In 1927, Mao wrote that "In a very short time...several hundred million peasants will rise like a mighty storm, like a hurricane, a force so swift and violent that no power, however great, will be able to hold it back." During the 40s and 50s, he was able to realize this vision to disastrous effect. On this show, Tulane Professor Brian DeMare joins the show to discuss the history and legacy of the land reform movement, including forays into the role of Xi's father and William Hinton's Fanshen.

      <title>Scholarstage on Xi, War in Taiwan, the CCP Toolkit, and the Chinese Tradition</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7bc</link>
      <description>Tanner Greer of the blog Scholarstage joins the show in a wide-ranging discussion touching on Xi's ideology, incentives in western China-watching, Mormons in China, why it's worth studying classical Chinese history, and AI-assisted writing. 
 ChinaTalk has hit its 100th episode! That's two and a half full workweeks of informed, respectful, and hopefully entertaining conversation on everything China. As the media industry has cratered, spaces for intelligent and open discussion on China that live outside of paywalls basically don't exist anymore. Since COVID has locked me out of China and forced me to move to the US, my living expenses have gone up, and spending dozens of hours on this podcast is looking increasingly unsustainable. Right now, I make less than $5 an hour producing this show. If you'd like to see ChinaTalk continue to come out weekly,
 Please consider supporting me at glow.fm/chinatalk
 I'm also thinking about launching some member rewards, like live zoom, tapings of episodes where audience members can ask questions as well as a book club. Thanks so much!

      <title>Superpower Showdown: Tale of a Trade War</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7be</link>
      <description>Lingling Wei and Bob Davis of the WSJ discuss their new book Superpower Showdown. We dive deep into the personal dynamics within the Xi and Trump administrations as well as what the twists and turns over the past few years reveal about the US-China relationship.
 Please consider supporting ChinaTalk. This show took me 10 hours of reading, 2 hours of script-writing, an hour of recording, and four hours of editing. Right now, I receive $50 in donations per episode, meaning my work on this podcast earns me $3/hr. I'm coming up on my 100th episode and of late have been reflecting on how much time I'm spending on something that brings in so little financially.

      <title>How Corruption Works in China</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7c1</link>
      <description>How can China be so corrupt and yet grow so fast? What's the relationship between corruption and competent governance? How does 'access money' at the higher levels differ from the 'profit-sharing' you see lower down in the bureaucracy? How does China in the 21st century compare with America's gilded age? And why won't anyone give me dinosaur eggs?
 To discuss, Prof. Yuen Yuen Ang joins the show to talk about her fantastic new book,  China's Gilded Age.
 Please subscribe to my Patreon! Or better yet, a full-time job offer as your humble host is very much unemployed! Patreon will suffice though.
 The incredible propaganda rap song feat. Xi Jinping here. 
 And the best Chinese tv show of the decade.

      <title>The H1B Ban and National Security</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7c2</link>
      <description>This week Trump banned valid H1B holders from entering the country. What are the broader implications for America's technological ecosystem and national security? To discuss, Tina Huang and Remco Zwetsloot from CSET talk about their recent research on tech and immigration. We discuss the potential lasting impacts of the, for now, temporary ban, how the US immigration process compares to other nations' policies, what China is doing to bolster their homegrown talent as well as the threat of corporate espionage. 
 Please consider donating to the ChinaTalk Patreon. 
 Here is the paper I mentioned on  corporate espionage. See here for the CSET research discussed.

      <description>On June 15th, dozens of soldiers died in clashes on the China-India border. What exactly happened up in the Himalayas? What's the historical background? What does this mean for the trajectory of China-India and US-India relations? 
 We also get into development policy, water rights, and some improv featuring terrible Trump and Modi accents (I didn't even try when doing Xi).

      <title>Hong Kong's Protests One Year On</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7c4</link>
      <description>This week’s ChinaTalk featured  Antony Dapiran going deep with me on the origin, meaning, and legacy of the 2019 Hong Kong protests. We drew parallels and contrasts throughout between HK and Black Lives Matter.
 If you'd like to help keep the show going, please consider subscribing to my Patreon.  
 An excerpt:
  What continues to be most tragic for Hong Kong is that the government really has demonized and made enemies of the people who support the protesters and the protesters themselves.
 Indeed, Carrie Lam, herself has described them as enemies of the people just yesterday. And so the government has made an enemy of an entire generation of its youth and also the engine of its service-led economy, the professional middle class.
 It’s obviously against the economic self-interest of Hong Kong, but also it's just a tragedy for a government, to divide its own community in that way and to treat the best and brightest of the community as enemies, effectively forcing them either to leave or condemning them to a lifetime of being marginalized and feeling, undervalued and, and, and not, not an accepted part of their own society.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s ChinaTalk featured  Antony Dapiran going deep with me on the origin, meaning, and legacy of the 2019 Hong Kong protests. We drew parallels and contrasts throughout between HK and Black Lives Matter.

 An excerpt:
  What continues to be most tragic for Hong Kong is that the government really has demonized and made enemies of the people who support the protesters and the protesters themselves.
 Indeed, Carrie Lam, herself has described them as enemies of the people just yesterday. And so the government has made an enemy of an entire generation of its youth and also the engine of its service-led economy, the professional middle class.
 It’s obviously against the economic self-interest of Hong Kong, but also it's just a tragedy for a government, to divide its own community in that way and to treat the best and brightest of the community as enemies, effectively forcing them either to leave or condemning them to a lifetime of being marginalized and feeling, undervalued and, and, and not, not an accepted part of their own society.

      <title>GM Corn Smuggled in Popcorn Bags: An Industrial Espionage Parable</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7c6</link>
      <description>What do you get when you take a Chinese national, a rental car, rural Iowa, and a $52 billion seed business hanging in the balance? Said one review, "not since Alfred Hitchcock's in North by Northwest has a cornfield produced so much excitement."
 Mara Hvistendahl's recent book, "The Scientist and the Spy," delivers a compelling narrative diving deep into the nature of Chinese industrial espionage and America's response.
 Do consider donating to the ChinaTalk Patreon. 
 I also write a weekly newsletter translating and analyzing Chinese new media. This past week's edition focused on how US anti-Huawei measures are leading to calls to  invade Taiwan and take TSMC.

      <title>Coronastories: Dispatches from Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7cc</link>
      <description>This week I'm trying something different. I've been interviewing my friends across China about their Coronavirus experiences, 故事FM style. We start off with Dev from Shanghai who lived through the entire lockdown and has interesting reflections on the lasting effects of social distancing on interpersonal relationships. 
 Next, I talked with Jen about how Hong Kong has navigated the crisis. Finally, Tianyu, who flew back mid-March to Beijing, discusses mandatory self-quarantine and the process of navigating the bureaucratic mess of QR health codes.
 I'm planning on potentially doing a few more of these so do reach out if you feel you have a story you'd like to share, not just about China but Asia more generally. I'm JordanSchneider on wechat, jorschneider@gmail.com or on twitter.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7cd</link>
      <description>Adam Ni and Yun Jiang are two former Australian government officials who together write Neican(内参), a fantastic new newsletter on Chinese policy and China-Australia relations. 
 We talk about how the CCP is trying to convince its population that post-coronavirus all is still well on the mainland. We also go into the main flashpoints from an Aussie perspective, focusing in particular on influence campaigns. 
 I've got a newsletter too!

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7ce</link>
      <description>What are the CCP's international propaganda goals? How is it faring in the battle to define COVID-19's winners and losers?  Matt Schrader of the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy brings the mirth in these dark times. We also go into tech and discrimination, stories from time working at China Daily and SmartAir, as well as Matt's favorite Overwatch characters.
 The audio gets better in the second half I promise.

      <title>Sinocism's Bill Bishop on the Politics of Coronavirus</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7cf</link>
      <description>Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter, comes on the show to discuss the new low in US-China relations. We start off talking about what China's response to coronavirus has taught us about the CCP and then go into the deeper forces behind why the Chinese government has started to blame America for creating the virus. We also touch on China-Taiwan relations, the role Sinocim plays in agenda-setting, as well as binge-able Chinese tv.

      <title>How Chinese Governance Fundamentals Impact Health Care and National Security</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7d0</link>
      <description>How has the distinct nature of local-central relations in the Chinese system impacted its response to coronavirus? To discuss, we have on Ryan Manuel, managing director of Official China, a consultancy that goes deep into CCP regulations and policy.
 Ryan previously taught at KHU and ANU as well as worked for the Australian government. Our wide-ranging conversation filled with dashes of dark Aussie humor starts with COVID-19 and SARS and then broadens out into how the history of rural healthcare in China explains dynamics that impeded the initial Chinese response. Next, we focus on how Hu Jintao created a model of managing local central relations that Xi studied and took to the next level by scrapping collective responsibility and working through Party as opposed to government channels.
 Also, we're on the Lawfare Network now! Thanks to everyone at SupChina who has contributed to this show over the past years.

      <title>Outraged by the outbreak: Citizen journalism and coronavirus censorship</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7d1</link>
      <description>Tony Lin is a producer at Quartz for the web series Because China and an avid observer of Chinese online communities, such as Weibo. After the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Tony noticed commentary being widely shared that, in other times, would have been censored immediately. 
 In this episode, Jordan and Tony create a timeline of the coronavirus, analyze the strikingly candid nature of online discussion in the early days of the outbreak, and explore broader themes of censorship and the role of media in Chinese society.

      <title>Reinterpreting Beijing and its history</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7d9</link>
      <description>Jeremiah Jenne, history teacher, writer, and the man behind Beijing by Foot, is in the guest seat this week. He speaks with Jordan about the changes — both tangible and intangible — that Beijing has undergone in the last few decades.

 10:57: Out with the old, in with the new
 15:17: What to make of the Qing dynasty, with help from the CCP 
 27:40: An age of censorship
 29:37: History is different in Beijing and Taipei

      <title>Tarriffs, taxes, and trade: Doug Irwin on ChinaEconTalk</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7df</link>
      <description>Douglas Irwin is the John French Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College and the author of Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy. On this episode, Irwin provides an overview to the history of U.S. trade policy from the 18th century to the modern day, highlighting significant legislation as well as the formation of important intergovernmental organizations that have sprung up along the way.
 19:53: On the flawed logic behind the Tariff Act of 1930, and the parallels with similarly problematic thinking in the modern day: “There’s absolutely a parallel there because some Democrats in Congress said, ‘You know, we ought to really think about this carefully, and not just our domestic interest but also our export interests, and other countries might retaliate.’ And basically, the reaction of most members of Congress was, Republicans at the time, ‘No, we don’t have to worry about that. This is a domestic piece of legislation, it doesn’t really concern other countries. They’re not going to retaliate.’ And, of course, they did.”
 39:40: Doug discusses the tips and tricks behind one example of “tariff engineering”: “The tariffs applied to motorcycles with piston displacements of 700cc and above. What Honda started doing is producing a 699cc version. Now the difference [between the two] is imperceptible, but just by changing that one cubic centimeter, it changed the whole tariff treatment and you avoided a 45 percent tariff and were assessed at a much, much lower rate.”
 Jordan will be hosting his first-ever live recording of ChinaEconTalk at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C., at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, September 19. Be sure to drop by Mission Dupont afterward for dinner or drinks!

      <title>How China Can Take Over Tech</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e0</link>
      <description>Douglas Fuller is an associate professor in the Department of Asian and International Studies at the City University of Hong Kong and the author of Paper Tiger, Hidden Dragons: Firms and the Political Economy of China’s Technological Development. In his book, Fuller explores a question that has hounded heads of state around the world for decades: How can a developing country get ahead in the tech sector? Drawing on the results of 499 interviews from experts over the course of 15 years, Fuller discusses China’s answer to this question in the context of its attempts to dominate the global semiconductor industry. Fuller and Jordan also touch on the transformative impact of the trade war and the concept of technology transfer and their implications for the immediate future of the Chinese tech sector. 
 Jordan’s newsletter is now available for sign-ups: chinaecontalk.substack.com. In the past few weeks, he’s translated articles on topics like the troubled future of VPNs in China, the role of “operations” in Chinese internet companies, and the rise of a cheese tea Starbucks slayer. 
 What to listen for in this week’s ChinaEconTalk:
 27:38: Chinese tech companies are often portrayed as monolithic, but in reality, the financial decisions that brought companies like ZTE and Huawei to the international stage are significantly different: “[Huawei CEO and founder] Ren Zhengfei — there was a method to his madness. He decided to forgo what were these rational incentive structures to just embrace state procurement and instead took a very high risk strategy of very early on looking abroad for contracts, for markets because he really wanted to hone Huawei’s capabilities by competing against the best… In contrast, a firm like ZTE was more than happy to be much more reliant on the Chinese marketplace when it went abroad. It sort of very much followed this [path of taking] China Development Bank subsidized loans to sell equipment in African countries where the leading foreign firms were not interested because the price points were so low.”
 41:16: What should U.S. policy look like in regards to Chinese tech policy? In considering this question, Fuller notes: “Investment binges [by China] have wrecked certain markets… Now the United States is extrapolating forward. What if they do this in memory chips or other semiconductor products? Those two areas are of high concern, particularly when thinking about, ‘Well, are these natural outcomes, or not?’ And I would say the investment binges and the levels of subsidization of a lot of industrial investment in China, this obviously didn’t just happen because the market dictated it.”

      <title>Tech triangles and AI ethics: Danit Gal on Chinese AI</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e1</link>
      <description>Danit Gal is a former Yenching Scholar and coauthor of a recent paper, “Perspectives and Approaches to AI Ethics: East Asia.” On this episode, Gal discusses how Japanese, South Korean, and Chinese experts are forging new paths in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), exploring societal applications — and the unexpected drawbacks of “female” virtual assistants. Gal also explains the tech connections between China and Israel, and the possible impact of the U.S.-China trade war on this relationship.
 What to listen for on this week’s ChinaEconTalk:
 15:56: Gal on her trip to Longquan Monastery in Beijing: “They basically have a Chinese robot monk, named Xian’er. I spoke to him and he gives you all these responses and talks to you about the deep meaning of Buddhist ceremonies… And then I asked him, ‘Who is your master?’ And then he answered to me very clearly, ‘The data is my master.’ And the monks freaked out — they [said] ‘No, no, no. We give him the data. We are the data. We feed him the ceremonies, and everything he has to say!’” 
 42:15: In a recent piece, Gal wrote that trade and technology tensions between the U.S. and China present both challenges and opportunities for Israel: “One clear way is that it’s really disrupting supply chains in that you would have to choose your alliances in order to get certain components at a good price and time. We’re getting to the point where a lot of companies are not allowed to trade directly and that significantly adds costs and uncertainty… An upside to that is actually that because American companies are not allowed to directly trade with China, they go through technical middlemen.”

      <title>The View from Chengdu: Freelance Reporting Outside First-Tier Cities</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e2</link>
      <description>On this episode of ChinaEconTalk, Jordan interviews Lauren Teixeira, a freelance reporter based in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. After what has been a jam-packed few months of China news, Lauren discusses a wide range of topics, from engaging with mainlanders about the anti-Extradition Bill protests in Hong Kong to the downsides of Chinese superblock urban planning. Lauren finishes the interview with a wide-ranging introduction to contemporary pop culture artists in China whose innovation and creativity are helping people to stay inspired at a challenging time. 
 What to listen for on this week’s ChinaEconTalk:
 6:59: Lauren recalls Ian Johnson’s comments to her during their conversation on engaging in political discussions in China: “He said to me, ‘There’s a ceiling for your rhetoric because at some point you can’t tell someone to “look it up” because they can’t look it up.’ Epistemologically you’re not on even ground. And so, if you want to really get into a real discussion with someone,  you basically have to redpill them.”
 14:41: On K-pop and geopolitics, as China tries to develop its own pop music industry: “It’s half import substitution and half, I think, just a concerted effort to build your own idol industry that you can better control. For example, there would be all these geopolitical conflicts. If something happened in the South China Sea, the Chinese idols would have to go on Korean television and be like, ‘F*** this, I’m a patriot.’ There was once a Taiwanese idol who waved a Taiwanese flag on a Korean reality show and she had to absolutely bend the knee to get back into the good graces of China, which was putting pressure on her agency.”

      <itunes:summary>On this episode of ChinaEconTalk, Jordan interviews Lauren Teixeira, a freelance reporter based in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. After what has been a jam-packed few months of China news, Lauren discusses a wide range of topics, from engaging with mainlanders about the anti-Extradition Bill protests in Hong Kong to the downsides of Chinese superblock urban planning. Lauren finishes the interview with a wide-ranging introduction to contemporary pop culture artists in China whose innovation and creativity are helping people to stay inspired at a challenging time. 
 What to listen for on this week’s ChinaEconTalk:
 6:59: Lauren recalls Ian Johnson’s comments to her during their conversation on engaging in political discussions in China: “He said to me, ‘There’s a ceiling for your rhetoric because at some point you can’t tell someone to “look it up” because they can’t look it up.’ Epistemologically you’re not on even ground. And so, if you want to really get into a real discussion with someone,  you basically have to redpill them.”

      <title>Reform and Opening with Soviet Characteristics: Russian Perspectives on China’s Rise</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e3</link>
      <description>This week on ChinaEconTalk, Jordan interviews Chris Miller, associate professor of international history at Tufts University and a specialist on Russian politics, economics, and foreign policy. Drawing on some of his recent publications, Miller discusses topics ranging from Sino-Soviet collaboration and competition to their respective economic and political reform programs in the 1970s and 80s. Miller concludes by exploring the significance of the collapse of the USSR in terms of the impression it made on Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping, and what this may suggest about the future of Chinese politics and the ongoing Sino-Russian relationship. As Xi himself is reported to have said during a closed-door meeting in 2012: “Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? … Finally, all it took was one quiet word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist Party, and a great party was gone. In the end nobody was a real man, nobody came out to resist.”
 What to listen for on this week’s ChinaEconTalk: 
 34:17: On the Soviet origins of Deng’s Reform and Opening strategy: “There was a period of learning [by China] from the Soviet Union in the 1950s right after the revolution...Deng picked that back up to a certain extent in the late 1970s...the goal was to give space to private enterprises in the countryside and to give space to farmers to operate without central Party control...Deng saw this and said, ‘I wonder if we can try something like this at home in China, and we can use Lenin to justify it.’”
 52:15: “The CCP interpretation, which is also the interpretation of many in Russia today, is that it’s plausible to have had a strong man reform the economy but keep the party and the state as they were, and in my research that just seems extraordinarily implausible…in some ways the Xi Jinping view is the ‘have your cake and eat it too’ version, and the reality is the history doesn’t support that counterfactual.”

      <title>East Asian AI: Researching Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Tech in Canada</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e4</link>
      <description>This week on ChinaEconTalk, Jordan speaks with Dongwoo Kim, a postgraduate research fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada who specializes in AI. Dongwoo discusses his research on the progress of AI development in Japan, Korea, and China, including the challenges faced by Chinese AI researchers overseas, and the need for greater tech literacy in general. What to listen for on this week’s ChinaEconTalk: 4:49: Misconceptions abound when it comes to AI, as do references to “Skynet” from the Terminator movies. “Strictly speaking, that’s not what we’re talking about,” Dongwoo says. “People have such a misunderstanding about this, and also the way in which we’re using AI now, it’s kind of subtle, right? It’s used by Google, it’s used by Facebook. If you don’t have the tech literacy, you’re not always going to be aware of it. So I think there’s a potential that if we don’t educate people about what AI really is and why this matters, we might get to a situation where people don’t really have a clear conception of what this AI thing is when it will be affecting so many aspects of their lives.”   32:36: On Chinese AI researchers in Canada: “[Problems are] not as overt as in the U.S. I think, if anything, the concerns that have materialized are if there’s funding within a Canadian postsecondary institution that is tied to an American partner, that may compromise their ability to continue working on that research project for a researcher of Chinese ethnicity. But there has been no concrete move to do that in Canada.” Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      <title>The Party in Cyberspace: China’s Digital Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e5</link>
      <description>This week, Jordan speaks with Graham Webster, a China digital economy fellow and coordinating editor of the DigiChina project at New America. He was previously a senior fellow and lecturer at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center. The two talked about Graham’s work at DigiChina, artificial intelligence in China and its complex legal infrastructure, the facts (and fiction) behind China’s controversial social credit system, and the potential for a new cold war between the U.S. and China. What to listen for on this week’s ChinaEconTalk: 10:23: “If the Chinese government wants to step on Huawei or somebody to get access to data, they’re not going to need this particular provision of law to do it. I think it’s a similar case with VPNs and these cross-border data rules. The pretty clear intent behind these rules is to expand on an increasingly detailed regime for protecting Chinese peoples’ data from abuse by companies or cyber criminals or just breaches due to bad security practices. It could be read in a way that would make VPNs problematic, but there are already other sets of regulations that make VPNs kind of problematic under Chinese law… From my perspective, this would be a very strange way for the Chinese government to try to cut down on VPNs, when they could just go at it directly and say it’s a violation of the principle of cybersovereignty.”  32:59: “In the end, we’re having this global discussion and people around the world are realizing how unaccountable various institutions and businesses are when they use automation. And there’s both real things going on in China, especially in Xinjiang, and a bunch of maybe slightly exaggerated or imagined things going on that capture people's imaginations about what could go wrong… I really would like it for people to be better informed about the realities of, for example, social credit because — my [former] colleague Jeremy Daum likes to say sometimes: ‘There are plenty of actual Chinese government offenses against human rights and against the dignity and well-being of Chinese citizens; we don’t need to invent other ones. We should focus on what’s actually happening.’” Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      <title>Little Red Book, Big Red Ideas: Part 2 of A Global History of Maoism</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e6</link>
      <description>This week, in part 2 of a special two-part edition of ChinaEconTalk, Jordan interviews Professor Julia Lovell, author of the recently published book on Mao’s international legacy entitled Maoism: A Global History. In this episode, Lovell recounts the ways in which Maoism truly started going global in the 1950s and 1960s. With some prompting courtesy of the Chinese government’s propaganda machine, self-described Maoist groups sprang up in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Western Europe, and even the U.S. Lovell explains how groups around the world interpreted the works and words of Mao in various ways and with varying results — from Black Panthers hosting study sessions of Mao’s Little Red Book in the U.S. to members of the Shining Path who espoused a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideology as they committed acts of guerilla warfare in Peru.

Quotes to listen for on this week’s episode: 21:19: Lovell describes the “counterculture craze” of the 1960s in Western Europe and the U.S., and the appeal of Maoism to such groups. “Student protestors, for example, who were dissatisfied with their universities and with their governments identified — or misidentified — Mao’s Cultural Revolution as a youth protest, and adopted its slogans such as ‘To rebel is justified’ (造反有理 zàofǎn yǒulǐ) or ‘Bombard the headquarters’ (炮打司令部 pàodǎ sīlìngbù) in their own revolts and demonstrations… Many Western radicals felt solidarity with Mao’s China, which was America’s number one detractor through this time. And this really followed the logic of ‘My enemy’s enemy is my friend.’” 34:13: Lovell tells the story of one of Mao Zedong’s generals, operating under the pseudonym of Mafaxian, who was sent to Zambia in an effort to recruit and indoctrinate lieutenants loyal to the political and militaristic precepts of Maoism. His mission was ultimately a failure, with Mafaxian feeling “embittered” toward the end of his years-long tenure. Lovell explains how this oral history is a “perfect grassroots example of how limited the possibilities of China’s ability to export its model were, despite the huge amounts of generosity and largesse.” Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      <description>This week, in part 1 of a special two-part edition of ChinaEconTalk, Jordan interviews Professor Julia Lovell, author of the recently published book on Mao’s international legacy entitled Maoism: A Global History. In this episode, Lovell introduces the core tenets of Maoist thought and its complex impact on both the Chinese Communist Party and other, offshoot devotees around the world. She outlines the key events in Mao’s life, the events that helped shaped his ideology, his idea of “violent, tumultuous world revolution,” and the friction during the Cold War that eventually culminated in the Sino-Soviet split. Sign up here for the ChinaEconTalk newsletter.  Learn more about CLI here and use the promo code 'jordan' for $100 off any program. Quotes to listen for in this episode: 15:10: “Maoism, although it has this singular name, it doesn’t actually correspond to a single, unitary phenomenon...it’s a set of ideas and practices that is living and breathing that has been translated and mistranslated across different decades and across many different regions. And above all, it’s a set of often very contradictory ideas. And this is no coincidence because Mao himself was a great admirer of the idea of contradiction. He saw contradictions as possessing a kind of primal energy. He saw them as something that drove history on. So when there were contradictions in his own ideas or when he perceived them around him, he tended to embrace them. Inconsistency didn’t bother him.” 43:48: “The intellectual, political nub of it is that Mao feels that after Stalin’s death, Khrushchev is losing the Soviet Union, losing their revolutionary bite. They’re making nice with the United States and they’re turning their backs on the idea of a violent, tumultuous world revolution.” 46:03: “Throughout his career and particularly toward the end of his life, he consistently saw himself as a rebel, as an outlier, as someone who made trouble. You see this very strongly in the Cultural Revolution, but you also see this in the way he tries and often succeeds to provoke the Soviets.” Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      <title>Learning to listen: China's billion-dollar podcast industry</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e8</link>
      <description>While it may be a pipe dream for ChinaEconTalk to ever merit a billion-dollar price tag, in China, podcast “unicorns” are everywhere. Companies like Ximalaya and Yudao have multibillion-dollar valuations, but feature startlingly different content from what consumers expect in the West. What drives these differences, and what does the future hold for spoken audio in China? To answer these questions, Yi Yang, a young podcast host and founder of the Mandarin-language podcast startup JustPod 播客一下, joins Jordan to explain how, after the advent of podcasts in China, people are finally “learning to listen.” Yi Yang's original podcast is called LeftRight 忽左忽右. His two branded podcasts are Startup Insider 创业内幕 and Bessie’s Notes 贝望录. ChinaEconTalk's newsletter is dope. Sign up here at www.chinaecontalk.substack.com. The latest issues include an analysis of why Amazon lost in China and learn about the bane of China’s automobile industry.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7e9</link>
      <description>This week on ChinaEconTalk, Jordan speaks with Donald Clarke, a specialist in Chinese law and the David Weaver Research Professor at George Washington University. Following a thorough introduction to the structure of the Chinese legal system starting from the Qing dynasty, Clarke discusses a provocative article he recently co-authored, Who owns Huawei?, which discusses in detail the legal ownership of Huawei Technology Co., Ltd. Clarke also deconstructs Huawei’s own legal arguments regarding whether its products (and, by extension, customers’ data) is subject to the Cybersecurity Law of the PRC and the National Intelligence Law of the PRC.

      <description>This week on ChinaEconTalk, Jordan speaks with veteran journalist Peter Hessler. Peter spent seven years in China as a correspondent for The New Yorker, followed by five years in Egypt. In this episode, Peter discusses his long and prolific career reporting on the society, politics, and culture of these two dynamic nations; he also considers the similarities and differences in the ways the Chinese and Egyptian people make sense of their respective places in the world based on their rich historical and cultural legacies. In addition, Peter reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and contrasts it with the 2013 mass protests and eventual coup d'état in Cairo.

      <title>How Local Bureaucrats Helped Create Chinese Tech Giants</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7ec</link>
      <description>Why did Shenzhen, a backwater fishing village, spawn the likes of industry leaders ZTE, Huawei, and Lenovo, while Suzhou, which previously scored massive investments from top “dragon head” foreign firms like Samsung and Philips, failed to spawn domestic innovation? What role did FDI and the local bureaucrats in charge of economic development play? And what lessons does this story hold for today's Chinese industrial policy as well as development and innovation economics more broadly? For answers, we turn to Ling Chen, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and the author of the recent book Manipulating Globalization: The Influence of Bureaucrats on Business in China.

      <title>Huawei May, But How?: China's Role in Global IT Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7ef</link>
      <description>Is Huawei unfairly maligned or rightly feared? Are the tech supply chains running through China a marvel of 21st-century globalization, or dangerous oversight on the part of U.S. tech firms and the federal government? Today’s guest on ChinaEconTalk — Nick Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute and a lecturer at UC Berkeley — provides some clarity. Huawei and other Chinese tech titans have found themselves on the defensive, pushing back against allegations of system backdoors and Chinese government influence. In layman’s terms, Nick explains some of the technical aspects behind the fears that have arisen around China’s role in tech supply chains and information technology infrastructure around the world.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7f0</link>
      <description>This week on ChinaEconTalk, host Jordan Schneider discusses China’s aviation industry with Neil Thomas, Research Associate at the Paulson Institute’s in-house think tank, MacroPolo. Focusing on Boeing’s long history in China, they explore how the company’s interactions with the state have actually proven to be a microcosm of the larger U.S.-China relationship — from early involvement navigating business in the Mao era to the more recent period of strategic competition. Jordan and Neil reflect on this remarkable evolution, and debate whether China’s dependence on U.S. aviation technology is sustainable or even desirable from a Chinese perspective.

Jordan and Neil reflect on this remarkable evolution, and debate whether China’s dependence on U.S. aviation technology is sustainable or even desirable from a Chinese perspective. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/1959352">Get bonus content on Patreon</a><br><p> See <a href="https://acast.com/privacy">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>China's exploited tech workers fight back</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7f3</link>
      <description>This episode of ChinaEconTalk features a discussion with two of the people behind recent, high-profile efforts to mobilize Chinese programmers against labor exploitation via GitHub, the world’s leading software development platform: Suji Yan, CEO of Dimension, and Katt Gu, J.D., Advisor at Asian-Pacific Blockchain Development Association and PhD candidate in informatics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Suji and Katt are on the front lines of a growing movement of thousands protesting working conditions for Chinese tech workers, which are characterized by outrageously long working hours — a practice widely referred to as “996,” shorthand for shops that require staff to work “from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.” In response, Suji and Katt developed and published the “Anti-996 License,” which allows developers to prohibit the use of their code by entities that do not adhere to basic labor standards. The license has been adopted by over 2,000 software projects to date and “liked” over 200,000 times. In addition to discussion their advocacy efforts, in this episode Suji and Katt share their views on the ever-evolving Chinese tech sector, including the history of Linux and the ongoing importance of open-source software development tools.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7f4</link>
      <description>This week on ChinaEconTalk, host Jordan Schneider speaks with James Griffiths, senior producer for CNN International, to discuss his new book, The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet. Together, they trace the history of the internet in China, from the early, heady days of relative freedom through the slow but steady tightening of government controls, and discuss China’s recent efforts to export its comprehensive model of internet censorship. Along the way, they consider questions on a range of issues including the impact of Google and the tireless efforts of netizens to work around online restrictions.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7f6</link>
      <description>This week's guest is Russ Roberts. He's a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and the host of the EconTalk podcast, a weekly interview-based show that’s vaguely about economics but that has, over time, evolved into an extended meditation on the human condition. Its diverse topics in the last few weeks have included Solzhenitsyn, the 2008 financial crisis, and gratitude. Even though this conversation will have little or nothing to do with China, seeing as Russ served as the inspiration for the ChinaEconTalk podcast, I hope you all find it interesting.

      <title>Rubber ducks and semiconductors: Navigating China’s legal system</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7f7</link>
      <description>“The champagne days are over,” writes Dan Harris, reflecting on how the tone of his China Law Blog has evolved since its creation in 2006. As the founder of Harris Bricken, an international law firm with a major China presence, Dan has a unique window into how macro changes in China’s economy and trade relations play out within a law firm.

      <title>China’s foothold in India’s tech ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7f9</link>
      <description>Today, nearly half of the top 100 apps in India's Google Play store are made by Chinese companies. After past failures to enter the Indian tech market, what's driving China tech's sudden success on the subcontinent? How have new Chinese companies like Bytedance and Xiaomi been able to localize more successfully than the likes of Tencent in the early 2010s? And just how seriously do Chinese firms take issues like child porn and fake news in India? To explore these topics, we spoke with Shadma Shaikh, a writer at Factor Daily. She and Jordan examine the multiple different aspects of China’s growing presence in India’s technology space. They also discuss the successes and failures of Chinese tech companies in India, the strategies that helped those companies find success, and the unique features of Indian culture (such as multiple languages), which have created difficulties for Western and Chinese tech companies that are eager to gain access to the Indian tech market.   ChinaEconTalk is open for sponsorships!

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b7fc</link>
      <description>“The U.S.-China equilibrium of the past 20 years has gone,” declares Gordon Orr in his recent piece on what to expect in China in 2019. So what will replace it? What impact will the increasingly activist Chinese government have on the broader economy? And what broader reflections does a 30-year China veteran have about recent changes in China? Orr is currently a director emeritus at McKinsey, having previously helped open the firm’s Beijing office and led its Greater China practice. He is also a board member of Lenovo and Meituan Dianping.

      <description>Foreign investors have lost billions expecting a Chinese financial crisis that hasn't come yet. So what gives? According to the Rhodium Group's Logan Wright, it's not China's domestic savings rate or RMB-denominated debt that’s keeping the economy afloat, but rather the government's credibility.

      <title>Daniel Kurtz-Phelan on George Marshall’s China Mission</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b801</link>
      <description>Daniel Kurtz-Phelan, the executive editor of Foreign Affairs, is the author of the recent book The China Mission: George Marshall's Unfinished War, 1945–1947. George Marshall, World War II hero and creator of the Marshall Plan, spent 1945-47 drinking baijiu with Mao and playing croquet with Chiang Kai-shek, fighting to stave off a civil war. Was the “loss of China” to the CCP inevitable? Did Marshall, with his strategy of forcing reconciliation on the Nationalists and Communists, in any way contribute to it? And what can we learn from Marshall's expedition to China about the limits of American influence abroad?

      <title>China's Domestic Sports Market With Mark Dreyer</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b802</link>
      <description>China's government aims to create a $500 billion sports industry by 2020. But how are those ambitions playing out on the ground in the Chinese basketball and soccer leagues? There's more to sports in China than the well-known problems of exorbitant transfer fees and match fixing, but with the government apparently unable to resist interfering in private leagues, does China have much hope for ever developing world-class teams? SupChina columnist and longtime China sports watcher Mark Dreyer gives his take. Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      <title>When Trade Wars Turned Bloody: The Opium War with Stephen Platt</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b806</link>
      <description>When it came to trade wars, the British didn't mess around. Four steam-powered battleships sent by the English to force China to change its trade policy in the mid-19th century changed the course of history. But how did they end up fighting the Chinese in the first place, and what are the contemporary echoes of this historical trade fight? Stephen Platt, the author of the recent Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China's Last Golden Age, answers these questions and more on the latest episode of ChinaEconTalk.

China Econ/Finance, FinTech, Financial Development Martin Chorzempa | PIIE Martin Chorzempa (@ChorzempaMartin) | Twitter Martin Chorzempa of the Peterson Institute is over traditional finance. Instead, spends his time analyzing the wild west of innovative consumer finance in China, a space full of unicorns, ponzi schemes, and overworked regulators desperately trying to stay up with the times. We discuss the promise and peril of social credit scores like Alibaba's Sesame Credit and the boom of Chinese peer to peer lending. Martin also explains how a digital gaming currency created by Tencent in the 2000s that developed a secondary market set the pattern that you can today see with its handling of bitcoin.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b816</link>
      <description>Max Zhou 周喆吾 is an Uber alum who until November of 2017 was the head of Mobile at Mobike. He is currently working as the co-founder of Meta App. Max talks about his story coming to the US for an advanced degree, his experience at Uber, why Travis Kalanick is really a Chinese entrepreneur at heart, and his take on China's 'Uber Mafia.' He then turns to Mobike and Ofo, speaking to the potential monetization pathways for the firms, their global expansion plans, their strategic investors' competing goals and merger prospects. He even shares his own crackpot theory of how the initial investors in Ofo and Mobike may be the ones leaking negative stories about Ofo spending deposit money and senior leadership living lavish lifestyles. We close by talking about his new project, MetaApp, which aims to allow users access to an app's full feature-set without having to download it. Max also recently appeared on 非诚勿扰, China's leading dating show. His segment starts about twenty minutes in. Chinese words used: 道德=ethics, morality 线下流量=offline visits 阴谋=conspiracy Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

We start by discussing the history of free zones and whether the Chinese success stories of SEZs such as Shenzhen drove their proliferation around the world.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b818</link>
      <description>Peter Lorentzen, professor of economics at the University of San Francisco, talks protests and provincial politics. We start by discussing 'Designing Contentious Politics in Post-1989 China,' which uses game theory to analyze and explain how the CCP responds to on-the-ground protests. Next, we take on his 'Racing to the Bottom or to the Top? Decentralization, Revenue Pressures, and Governance Reform in China' and explore what actually drives municipal responses to orders from on high. Music this week by 阴三儿, 北京晚报 and 没钱没朋友. Do note that after this episode was recorded, some protests against "low-end population" removal broke out. Get bonus content on Patreon See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      <title>Julian Gewirtz on Unlikely Partners: Western Economists and Reform and Opening</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b81b</link>
      <description>Julian Gewirtz is currently a Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and author of Unlikely Partners: Chinese Reformers, Western Economists, and the Making of Global China. In it, he argues that "western economists played a crucial role in shaping the ideas and strategies of key CCP economists and policymakers. Without their participation, China would not have reformed as quickly, innovatively, and successfully." In this discussion, we focus on the critical 1985 Bashan Conference and the echoes of the Unlikely Partners narrative you can see even today in Chinese policymaking. Julian's book recommendations included 9 Continents and Everything Under the Heavens. Follow Julian on twitter at @JulianGewirtz.

      <title>The Book of Swindles: Cons from the Late Ming Dynasty</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b81c</link>
      <description>In Zhang Yingyu’s work from the late Ming Dynasty, you’ll encounter swindling concubines, clever commoners, and even eunuch cannibals trying to regrow their members. “We live in an age of deception. Words and appearances mislead. Con artists prey on the unwary. In this world of swindlers, one must rely on one’s wits to survive. How, then, to guard against the duplicity that lurks behind every smiling face? Look to your kin, keep your possessions close, and trust no one. But first, read The Book of Swindles.” Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk, both associate professors of Asian studies at the University of British Columbia, have recently published The Book of Swindles’ first English translation. In this interview, they discuss the work's historical and cultural context as well as walk through some of the most shocking, revealing, and prurient stories The Book of Swindles has to offer.

      <title>Cynthia Estlund on Labor in China</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/g/episodes/6105626a7c2a82001a79b81d</link>
      <description>China’s massive labor surplus has been vital to its rapid economic development. For decades, China’s rural population has been migrating to take up low-wage jobs in the coastal regions, often in dire conditions. The exploitation of cheap labor has helped China become the world’s factory. However, as China’s labor surplus is running out, the position of workers is changing. In A New Deal for China’s Workers, New York University’s Cynthia Estlund examines the evolution of workers’ rights and protests in China. Drawing a comparison with the struggle of workers to attain more rights in the US, Estlund asks whether China’s workers will succeed in securing a New Deal with Chinese characteristics.
