Drawing on decades of experience as both an entrepreneur and investment banker, Ezra shares his unique framework for maximizing M&amp;A outcomes, emphasizing that successful startup exits are driven not by a traditional sales process, but by building strategic relationships and unlocking future value for acquirers.<br /><br />Ezra introduces the "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG86NT6F?ref=vcmastermind.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Box Paradigm</a>," a visual and practical approach that helps founders and investors focus on the unique value their company can unlock for specific buyersâwhat he calls the "purple boxes." He explains why M&amp;A is fundamentally different from fundraising, how to avoid the pitfalls of a sales-driven mindset, and why starting early with strategic relationship-building is key. The conversation covers actionable advice for VCs and board members on how to guide their portfolio companies, the importance of thought leadership, and how to navigate both strategic and private equity exits.<br /><br />Listeners will come away with a fresh perspective on startup M&amp;A, including when to bring in advisors, how to structure deals creatively, and why conventional wisdomâlike relying on competitive bidding or rushing to term sheetsâoften falls short.

He was interviewed by Ben Casnocha, co-founder and general partner at Village Global, an early stage venture capital firm backed by some of the worldâs most successful entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Takeaways:<br /><br />- Any modern cloud-native app is a nexus of services that all work together to create a coherent interface for the user. For example, Auth0 handles login, Stripe handles billing, React is used for the interface, among many more services all working in concert. Vercel helps ensure that the user has an amazing experience no matter what services are all working together on the back end.<br /><br />- Guillermo tells the story of open source Unix winning out over proprietary versions of Linux, even though the proprietary versions had an early lead. He suggests that over the long term, open source will win, more often than not, and that the same story will likely play out when it comes to AI models, with open source models winning out in the end.<br /><br />- When it comes to investing, Guillermo loves to bet on someone who has been obsessed with a topic for years and years. He recounts the story of the Auth0 team who had written books and given talks and spent years of their lives just on logging in and logging out. He also says that he prefers a leadership team that lives and breathes a companyâs problem space. He says that he's allergic to the idea of a professional leadership team swooping in at a certain stage.<br /><br />- Rauch was born and raised in Argentina. He says that he has a sense of urgency and that tomorrow is not promised that stems from his childhood experience growing up in Argentina. He tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg keeping the Sun Microsystems logo on the back of the Facebook sign at their headquarters when they moved in to cultivate a sense that tomorrow is not promised to anyone.<br /><br />- Guillermo believes in giving his team leads radical ownership of their products. He provides the leads with frameworks that explain clear principles for how they build products at Vercel but beyond that he gives the leads a long leash and a sense of ownership over the product.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform.<br /><br />Check us out on the web at www.villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Want to get updates from us?

Thejo is a two-time founder and CEO. His current company, Airbase, is a spend management platform serving companies with 100 and 5,000 employees like Coda, 15Five, Front, Marqueta, CaptivateIQ, Abnormal, and more. Airbase has raised over $200 million, has tens of millions in ARR, and is consistently ranked as a top spend management company by G2.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />- Rather than jumping into building Airbase, he built high-fidelity mockups and went back to prospective customers and asked if theyâd buy it to âpre-sellâ it.<br /><br />- In B2B, build for a specific, recognizable buyer. You want to sell to a specific role within the org who will be your champion. Ideally this is someone who also has influence within the org.<br /><br />- Select the kinds of customers who arenât likely to switch in the early days. Team with early customers who actually want to be partners and are motivated by the relationship. Flatter them by asking: âare there any other innovative, forward-thinking leaders you know who I should also talk to?â<br /><br />- 6-8 months later after proving value and showing they could be a good partner, he said âhey, I want to get your feedback on our pricing model. Is this fair for the next set of customers?â 100% of the customers converted when he asked if they were willing to opt in to the pricing structure with a significant discount for their initial partnership.<br /><br />- When hiring salespeople, Thejo focuses more on personality traits rather than prior experience selling to the same segment. Also, if candidates are drawn to the liquid comp at a large, public company, theyâre likely going to have a hard time transitioning to a startup. Find people who have been comfortable taking risks.<br /><br />- Airbase is fully remote and Thejo doesnât think in terms of onshore vs. offshore within the company because that instantly creates a class system. Anyone anywhere in the world is part of their single, remote team, which has the internet as its headquarters. Each member of the team is âequitably inconveniencedâ in his words.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform.Â Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/59657196</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:29:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/59657196/thejo_kote.mp3" length="55437732" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Village Global</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Thejo Kote (@thejo) talks to Village partner Ben Casnocha.

For example, you might be anxious and stressed yourself and that makes the candidate nervous â you may end up experiencing them as nervous, but in fact you are the one that has created that dynamic in the interview.<br /><br />- Ask the candidate: âIf you were hiring someone to fill this role, what criteria would you use?â When someone is particularly good, they are skilled at capturing the essence of what makes someone good at it. This also lets you see how they respond without initial priming and framing.<br /><br />- The ideal reference check call should take longer than you might think (e.g. 45+ mins). You sometimes need to wear them down over a long period of time before they open up about their real concerns.<br />- If you arenât aware of or canât imagine the downside of working with this person, you havenât done enough reference checking.<br /><br /><br />- Ask: âHow strong is your endorsement of Jane on a scale of 1-10?

Lee and his companies are building innovative solutions in retail and e-commerce and have worked with worldâs most admired brands like Nike, Adidas and Disney where they enabled same-day and 1-hour delivery for customers nationwide. Theyâve also worked with tech companies like Snapchat, Shopify and Stripe to enable next generation payments and loyalty program solutions. <br /><br />Takeaways:<br /> <br />- Lee says cities will look completely different in a few decades. Retail has been the backbone of cities for a very long time but as more and more commerces goes online, physical stores will transform into more of a place to go to have an experience.<br /> <br />- In the old days loyalty programs used stamps to provide a potential discount on a future purchase but now provide the customer with more convenience and a better experience.<br /> <br />- Loyalty programs have been transforming into tiered programs where a customer can pay for status. Lee predicts that every single loyalty program will turn into a tiered program with multiple paid options in the future. For example, there may be multiple levels of Amazon Prime in the same way that there are multiple tiers at American Express.<br /> <br />- Dark stores were pioneered in the UK and leveraged existing stores that had excess space to carry products from many different retailers in one place. Lee partnered with companies like Office Depot, Mattress Firm, and Iron Mountain to make Darkstore a reality. Fun fact: 90% of the population of the US lives within 5 miles of an Office Depot, and on average only three people a day walk in to a mattress store.<br /> <br />- FastAF, the consumer-facing brand at Darkstore, provided high-end versions of the products that someone would typically find in a convenience store. A lot of the core value was the curation that went into which products to carry.<br /> <br />- One of the keys to success for a business like Darkstore is to consider unit economics on a per-building basis and to make sure that there is enough population in any one place to support a physical location.<br /> <br />- Running two companies has made Lee better at both of them as compared to running only one. He says that many insights are transferrable between them. Also, when making decisions, Lee asks whether a decision is reversible or not and spends most of his time on the irreversible decisions and errs towards moving quickly on the reversible ones.<br /> <br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform.<br /> <br />Check us out on the web at www.villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal. <br /><br />Want to get updates from us?

Prescott is co-founder of Port Power, a software platform that aims to de-risk commercial fleetsâ adoption of electric vehicles by ensuring their charging infrastructure functions flexibly and reliably. Takeaways:<br /> <br />- With gas or diesel-powered vehicles, drivers take the car to the energy source (the gas station). With electric vehicles, that paradigm doesnât work for fleets of commercial vehicles that need to be charged up overnight. This means that a fleet operator needs to build charging infrastructure to charge 30, 50, perhaps 100 vehicles simultaneously.<br /> <br />- Building the charging infrastructure requires huge efforts by multiple players and right now the grid can only support a small fraction of the power that is required. Full support all of the charging that needs to happen is many years away.<br /> <br />- Prescott says there are real âsticksâ coming for fleet operators. As early as 2026, there will be restrictions on the ability of fleet operators to buy diesel vehicles.<br /> <br />- Moving to electric vehicles requires a huge effort on the part of the government as well as private operators who build and co-fund the infrastructure required. Prescott says that there has been a significant brain drain from government. It needs to attract many more talented people in order to solve these challenges.<br /> <br />- Access to electricity will play a key role in commercial development and real estate in the future.

Takeaways:<br /><br />- In the US healthcare system the interests of patients, providers, and payers are not aligned. This drives many of the problems in the system today and is part of what inspired Mark to get involved in trying to disrupt the system.<br /><br />- Mark started Cost Plus Drugs to try to address some of the pricing issues with prescription drugs in the US. The company's pricing is completely transparent and shows their costs along with the exact fees they charge. He says that they do zero marketing and their growth comes from earned media and referrals from their existing patient base.<br /><br />- Mark advises founders not to try to optimize the current healthcare system but rather to work outside of the system to bring about real change. Working within the system can bring change around the edges but commits you to working inside a system that is already broken in the hopes that an incumbent player might buy you.<br /><br />- Every pitch deck that Mark sees now has an AI angle to it. Heâs gone deep on the field over the last several years and says that when a person digs into many of these pitches the companies are using off-the-shelf large language models and have little defensibility.<br /><br />- Precision medicine is one of the most exciting and scary emerging technologies. Mark says that in the next 50-100 years we will be able to compile all the variables that drive how our bodies and minds work and AI will be able to create a precise simulation of our bodies and how to treat them to improve our health.<br /><br />- One of Markâs favourite sayings is that âlife is half random.â The conditions around a person are continually changing and contribute greatly to a personâs success.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform.<br /><br />Check us out on the web at www.villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Want to get updates from us?

Working within the system can bring change around the edges but commits you to working inside a system that is already broken in the hopes that an incumbent player might buy you.<br /><br />- Every pitch deck that Mark sees now has an AI angle to it. Heâs gone deep on the field over the last several years and says that when a person digs into many of these pitches the companies are using off-the-shelf large language models and have little defensibility.<br /><br />- Precision medicine is one of the most exciting and scary emerging technologies. Mark says that in the next 50-100 years we will be able to compile all the variables that drive how our bodies and minds work and AI will be able to create a precise simulation of our bodies and how to treat them to improve our health.<br /><br />- One of Markâs favourite sayings is that âlife is half random.â The conditions around a person are continually changing and contribute greatly to a personâs success.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform.<br /><br />Check us out on the web at www.villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Want to get updates from us?

Jon is the Global Head of Blackstone Growth (BXG) and Co-Head of Technology Investing at Blackstone. Prior to joining Blackstone, Jon was Head of General Atlanticâs Global Financial Services and Healthcare sectors.<br /><br />Takeaways:<br /><br />- The vast reach of Blackstone, as one of the biggest asset managers in the world, allows them to apply their huge base of operational infrastructure to âmake the winning company, not just find the winning company.â<br /><br />- Entrepreneurs have accepted that we are not going back to 2021 valuations. There will be many casualties on the road ahead. Jon worries that VCs are doing certain complex deals to protect their marks and that there will be a number of zombie portfolios coming out in the next few years.<br /><br />- The correction has a silver lining: lots of tech transformation comes out of a downturn. This is a healthy thing, like a brush fire in a forest. Also, startups have more and more talent available to them as the cost of leaving an existing job has never been lower.<br /><br />- When Jon meets founders he pays attention to how often they let the people around them speak. Great founders are humble and surround themselves with people who challenge their thinking.<br /><br />- Jon recommends that people spend time working and living abroad if they can. He says that his time spent overseas has informed his thinking on markets and given him a competitive advantage at work.<br /><br />- The sign of a good board member is that they never show up to a board meeting and learn something they didnât already know.

You want people who have a sense of adventure and can work without a lot of structure.<br /><br />- The first fifty hires at a company completely define the company culture.<br /><br />- Tech debt is a fact of life. Donât worry about it until you get to MVP.<br /><br />- When youâre a founder, consider whether you want a poet or a librarian as a product leader.

Confidence and optimism have declined and culture has entered a repetitive spiral where patterns from the 60s/70s have been repeating themselves.<br /><br />- Government has become less effective and more gridlocked over time.<br /><br />- The worldâs richest societies are dealing with a population problem. They are not reproducing themselves, which has led to aging societies that are âstable but stuckâ because they are resistant to change.<br /><br />- The internet has been more of a conduit to cultural repetition than people think âÂ old music is often most popular music on streaming services.<br /><br />- The traditional story of science has been that it triumphed over religion but science emerged from an extremely religious society and it would be no surprise to Ross if as religion decays scientific progress might as well.<br /><br />- Ross says that we need a renaissance to get ourselves out of the age of decadence âÂ a reaching back into the past while synthesizing all the advancements that have come about in the meantime.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on yourÂ favorite podcast platform.<br /><br />Check us out on the web atÂ <a href="http://www.villageglobal" rel="noopener">www.villageglobal</a>.vcÂ or get in touch with us onÂ Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Want to get updates from us?

Confidence and optimism have declined and culture has entered a repetitive spiral where patterns from the 60s/70s have been repeating themselves.<br /><br />- Government has become less effective and more gridlocked over time.<br /><br />- The worldâs richest societies are dealing with a population problem. They are not reproducing themselves, which has led to aging societies that are âstable but stuckâ because they are resistant to change.<br /><br />- The internet has been more of a conduit to cultural repetition than people think âÂ old music is often most popular music on streaming services.<br /><br />- The traditional story of science has been that it triumphed over religion but science emerged from an extremely religious society and it would be no surprise to Ross if as religion decays scientific progress might as well.<br /><br />- Ross says that we need a renaissance to get ourselves out of the age of decadence âÂ a reaching back into the past while synthesizing all the advancements that have come about in the meantime.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on yourÂ favorite podcast platform.<br /><br />Check us out on the web atÂ <a href="http://www.villageglobal" rel="noopener">www.villageglobal</a>.vcÂ or get in touch with us onÂ Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Want to get updates from us?

The best way to increase probability of getting asset class rate of return is by increasing variance in the portfolio through diversification. Pattern matching tends to reduce variance and contrary to industryâs beliefs, is undesirable from the systematic approach perspective.<br />Â <br />There is no limit to diversification beyond practical limitations of being able to see and invest in all the relevant deals for GPs. 20-30 portfolio companies is a typical level of diversification in other asset classes including growth equity and buyout where returns are normally distributed. In early stage venture (pre-seed to Series A) this level of diversification is less likely to produce industry average returns on a consistent basis.<br />Â <br />The average rate of unicorn production is 1-2% in the industry but it varies across sectors, vintage years and geographies. So, Verdis chooses to maximize diversity across the number of companies, sectors and vintages because there is no clear indication in data that subsets of those are more likely to produce outliers but invest with a bias towards key geographies due to higher concentration of unicorns there.<br />Â <br />Most of the outliers in the US of the last decade came from two geographies - California and New York. The magnitude of these outliers was also significantly greater than unicorn companies built elsewhere. For example, on average it takes 4 non-California outliers to equal the magnitude of outcome of a California unicorn.<br />Â <br />Startup exit data from other geographies looks a lot more normally distributed which calls for a different approach.<br />Â <br />Data-driven investment strategyâs main drawback is the backward-looking nature of the approach. But itâs useful in that it provides a systematic approach to guide portfolio construction.<br />Â <br />If managers believe that the part of the VC asset class they focus on follows power law distribution, then they would want to have the most diversified portfolio as possible with a lot more than traditional 10-20 companies. In the power law world, losses donât matter.<br />Â <br />One of the key insights from investing in venture for almost two decades is that most managers are going to stage-drift.

Heâs "bringing smart contracts to where the money is."<br /><br />- Bitcoinâs architecture implies that there shouldnât be much flexibility and programmability on the base layer blockchain.<br /><br />- A criticism of Ethereum is that it is trying to be too many things to too many people.<br /><br />- There is a basket of Layer-1s that are gaining market share against Ethereum.<br /><br />- One criticism of Bitcoin is that there are only two things you can do with a wallet â sit on your BTC or send it to someone else.<br /><br />- Bitcoin has the most mainstream adoption and has âcrossed the chasmâ more than any other cryptocurrency.<br /><br />- All of the forks of Bitcoin are worth less than 1% of the current market cap of Bitcoin.<br /><br />- Bitcoin is very durable and resilient.

He takes us through his argument that thereâs a moral imperative for economic growth. He talks about why economic growth is the greatest force for good in the world, why redistribution isnât as effective as Effective Altruists would like, and why we dramatically underestimate the effects of compounding.

He is known as one of the most inspirational leaders in Silicon Valley and is a highly sought-after mentor to CEOs including Brian Chesky at Airbnb, Drew Houston at Dropbox, and Ben Silbermann at Pinterest. Weâre honored to have him among our small group of world-class executives and collaborators whose time and expertise help power our network of founders atÂ Village Global.<br /><br />He shared advice on when toÂ hire ahead, invest in and train, or replace personnelÂ on your team and gave insight into hisÂ most common piece of adviceÂ on professional growth when advising CEOs. John also did an in-depthÂ demonstrationÂ of how to let someone go with dignity and grace.<br /><br />Quotes From This Episode<br /><br />"When you talk about priorities at an aspirational level, they overlap a lot. People start realizing we're more similar than we're dissimilar." <br /><br />"Adversity never feels fun. I don't seek adversity. But I'm no longer scared of adversity. When it emerges, instead of trying to run from it, I now accept that it is a reality and I say, 'well, at least I'm going to learn and grow.'" <br /><br />"My experience has been that around any issue that involves change, you have roughly 20-25% of people who want to be part of it, no matter what the topic is, you have 25-30% of people who want to fight it, and you have the 50% of people in the middle saying 'which side is going to win?'" <br /><br />"[When someone is let go] The fear is humiliation usually. That's almost a bigger fear than actually leaving the company." <br /><br />"We're never as good or as bad as labels make us out to be." <br /><br />"I would say in general, for every 10 hours of business development conversations, 8 of them are a waste." <br /><br />"I do gratitude practice driving into work every morning. It's proven in brain science that your brain becomes more negative over time. But it's also been proven in brain science that you can counteract that." <br /><br />"The older I get, the more I've made friends with uncertainty. I don't avoid uncertainty. Uncertainty is as present to me today as it was before but I'm a little more comfortable with it today." <br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/46365960</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/46365960/greatest_hits_john_donahoe.mp3" length="52128331" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Village Global</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>We're re-releasing some of the best episodes from the podcast this summer.&#13;

After graduation, Schmidt interned at both Xerox PARC and Bell Labs. He recounts stories of his time at the research labs and discusses to what extent the lab model does or doesnât work today. Cowen points out that Schmidt is one of the few people around whose career spans several significant eras in the history of computing.<br /><br />They move on to talking about the early days at Google, where it turns out that Schmidt was hired to run the company after a skiing trip with Larry and Sergey, whose first concern in hiring âadult supervisionâ was to find someone they enjoyed hanging out with. Schmidt says that he initially assumed that search wasn't very important and that Googleâs ads didnât work. He reveals that during his first year he was so terrified that their "ruse would unravel" that he made anyone who wanted to spend money come to him personally on Fridays at 10am to justify the expense.<br /><br />Cowen asks about Schmidtâs insights on hiring and managing talent. Schmidt explains that in the beginning Larry and Sergey primarily hired their classmates and friends, but over time Googleâs hiring became highly structured. He tells the story of interviewing a single candidate 16 times and explains the logic of why initially they were so focused on school and GPA, rather than industry experience.<br /><br />Cowen and Schmidt also talk about in which areas even Schmidt himself has been surprised at the extent of technological progress and where he'd like to see more innovation. They discuss social media and why Schmidt says that it amplifies human weaknesses rather than strengths. The two of them also talk about transforming cities, including Alphabetâs Sidewalk Labs project in Toronto and the Bay Area's housing crisis.<br /><br />They also have a round of rapid-fire âoverrated vs. underrated,â covering subjects like Antarctica, Picasso, effective altruism, Yellowstone and North Korea. Cowen also asks about the Eric Schmidt "production function" and how Schmidt is able to be so productive.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/46084036</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 12:00:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/46084036/greatest_hits_eric_schmidt_tyler_cowen.mp3" length="51670248" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Village Global</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>We're re-releasing some of the best episodes from the podcast this summer.&#13;

Erik interviewed Naval Ravikant (@naval) and Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis). <br /><br />They start with an overview of the history of organizing societies and the role of centralized decision-makers from kings to democracies and why decentralization â where no one in particular is in charge but everybody follows the rules â has so much potential.

They paint a picture of a world where there might be virtual âinstant jobsâ available on-demand in a feed akin to the feeds in current social networks and where the â99%â will be investors, as opposed to the present where only 1% of individuals are investors.

He has a biting critique of the companies that are going public without having ever been profitable or cash flow positive â but more importantly, without having a plan for getting to that point.<br /><br />Parker and Tim discuss the misalignment of incentives that can happen in venture capital, and some of the alternative models that are sprouting up to solve that problem.

He has a biting critique of the companies that are going public without having ever been profitable or cash flow positive â but more importantly, without having a plan for getting to that point.<br /><br />Parker and Tim discuss the misalignment of incentives that can happen in venture capital, and some of the alternative models that are sprouting up to solve that problem. He gives his advice for what entrepreneurs should do when getting started and how they should approach raising money. <br /><br />They also discuss policy changes that could lead to longer-term thinking by investors, whether Tim foresees a âSilicon Valley meltdown,â as well as why inequality is such a pressing issue and how to solve it.<br /><br />We want to apologize for the audio quality of the second half of this episode.

They are now working together on a new fund.<br /><br />They talk about how they came to the idea theyâre working on, including how to find the right intersection of ideas among those that are interesting to you, that you are uniquely skilled at, that others donât yet appreciate, and that are worth working on.<br /><br />They explain what data co-ops are and the unique value that they can bring. Auren says he believes that the future is about managing vendors rather than people, and points out that WhatsApp didnât even build their core messaging functionality themselves in the first place.<br /><br />Erik asks whatâs changed in company building since they started their companies in the 2000s and what the next ten years will look like in venture capital. They also talk about why the Valley is flush with cash and whether they are long San Francisco in an era of distributed teams.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.

Weâre honored to have him among our small group of world-class executives and collaborators whose time and expertise help power our network of founders atÂ Village Global.<br /><br />When we asked John to deliver a Masterclass to 12 diverse and determined founders in our portfolio, John gladly invited us all to the ServiceNow HQ where he riffed on topics of leadership, culture building, talent development, and how to grow as a CEO in the tech industry.<br /><br />He shared advice on when toÂ hire ahead, invest in and train, or replace personnelÂ on your team and gave insight into hisÂ most common piece of adviceÂ on professional growth when advising CEOs. John also did an in-depthÂ demonstrationÂ of how to let someone go with dignity and grace.<br /><br />Quotes From This Episode<br /><br />"When you talk about priorities at an aspirational level, they overlap a lot.

When it emerges, instead of trying to run from it, I now accept that it is a reality and I say, 'well, at least I'm going to learn and grow.'" âÂ John<br /><br />"My experience has been that around any issue that involves change, you have roughly 20-25% of people who want to be part of it, no matter what the topic is, you have 25-30% of people who want to fight it, and you have the 50% of people in the middle saying 'which side is going to win?'" âÂ John<br /><br />"[When someone is let go] The fear is humiliation usually. That's almost a bigger fear than actually leaving the company." âÂ John<br /><br />"We're never as good or as bad as labels make us out to be." âÂ John<br /><br />"I would say in general, for every 10 hours of business development conversations, 8 of them are a waste." â John<br /><br />"I do gratitude practice driving into work every morning. It's proven in brain science that your brain becomes more negative over time. But it's also been proven in brain science that you can counteract that." âÂ John<br /><br />"The older I get, the more I've made friends with uncertainty. I don't avoid uncertainty.

Eric is a Village Global LP, friend of the firm, and author of The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses.<br /><br />Over the nearly 75-minute session, Eric gave a masterclass in Lean Startup techniques, addressed questions from founders on some of the finer details of the framework, and shared what he has learned from his entrepreneurial journey in the early 2000s as well as more recently as founder of the Long Term Stock Exchange.<br /><br />Eric and Ben start out by talking about uncertainty as the core of a startup and the stark contrast between planning in an early-stage company versus in a large enterprise. Eric points out that those in the startup world take for granted certain startup best practices that âwould get you fired in any big company.â He talks about the need for structure around entrepreneurial exploration, including making oneâs hypotheses explicit and rigorously testing them.<br /><br />Eric discusses the difference between customer discovery and customer validation. He tells the story of a founder who interviewed prospective customers and was told that the product was great and that they would use it, but that when he asked those same customers to put their name to a letter recommending their bosses purchase the product, not one would do so.<br /><br />âThe ideas that sound big are usually not the things that end up big.â<br /><br />They move on to a discussion of pivots and why Eric says that in virtually all cases, after having pivoted, founders say they wish they had done so sooner. He explains why every six weeks is an ideal cadence for a âpivot or persevereâ meeting.<br /><br />MVP (minimum viable product) has become household term that was popularized by Eric. He discusses how founders can get over their fear of shipping something they perceive as incomplete and why he says the ideal MVP has âway fewer features than you think it needs.â He fields questions from Village founders on MVPs and talks about how small companies should think about their MVP when targeting large companies as customers.<br /><br />âEngineers always think that more features will solve any problem.â<br /><br />Eric explains what he means when he says that âentrepreneurship is a process of self-discoveryâ and why managing yourself and your own emotions as a founder can be equally as important as managing those of your team. He also addresses some of the criticisms of the Lean Startup methodology and common misunderstandings of the framework.<br /><br />âI truly believe that entrepreneurship is a process of self-discovery. I think that two people working on the exact same company, encountering the exact same evidence, and deciding on a pivot, would probably choose two different pivots if they had different values. You discover something about what you really care about.â<br /><br />Along the way, they discuss some of the seminal works in entrepreneurship, like The Four Steps To The Epiphany by Steve Blank and Crossing The Chasm by Geoffrey Moore.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.

Elaine was co-founder of Meebo and is now investing at Edelweiss VC (<a href="https://www.edelweiss.vc" rel="noopener">https://www.edelweiss.vc</a>) alongside co-founder Lee Jacobs (<a href="https://www.leejacobs.co" rel="noopener">https://www.leejacobs.co</a>).<br /><br />Elaine explains her superpower â being able to build quantitative systems around qualitative characteristics. She talks about how to evaluate candidates with your team and the way she uses TaskRabbit workers to calibrate her teamâs assessment of a candidate. Elaine discusses why work simulations are so important in hiring and breaks down how you create a good simulation. <br /><br />She explains why she asks behavioral questions exclusively in interviews. She tells founders that it's okay (and ideal) if they are spending more than half of their time recruiting. Elaine points out that an employeeâs experience on the first day is the best predictor of the length of their tenure.<br /><br />She talks about the ârecruiter honeypotâ that she set up â a fake profile on LinkedIn of a Javascript programmer. She looked at how recruiters approached it in order to potentially hire those recruiters to her company.<br /><br />She also addresses some of the biggest misconceptions about recruiting and talks through how to deal with some of the thorniest aspects of managing people, including annual reviews, compensation, and having difficult conversations.<br /><br />Quotes From This Episode<br /><br />âThe test of a work simulation is that any smart, well-intentioned person should fail that simulation.â<br /><br />â[When interviewing someone] within the first five minutes, you have a tendency to have a reaction. Itâs easy to fall into first impressions, but itâs your job to challenge that first response.â<br /><br />âIf people just want to get their review to find out whether they got their raise or their bonus, that isnât going to be a great conversation, so my goal is to de-couple that.â<br /><br />âPeople always seem to care more about where they stand in the organization than they do about where they stand outside the organization.â<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.

They talk about the future of venture and whether there will be more M&A in the space and where he sees things going in the next 10 years. Keith explains why being an effective VC is much more an art than a science.<br /><br />Erik asks about Keithâs goals at this point after all that he has already accomplished and why itâs thus far not been possible to scale oneâs investing model beyond oneâs self. Keith also has a well-known theory about breaking down businesses into equations and Erik asks whether one can do the same with careers as well. <br /><br />Keith recounts the story of working for Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel at PayPal and how he has learned to trust his instincts in the absence of specific quantitative metrics. He talks about why being vertically integrated is important for a startup, why getting the timing right is part of a founderâs job (and canât be a founderâs excuse for failure), and why in his view founder quality trumps all other factors when evaluating a business.<br /><br />He also talks about some of his requests for startups, including an integrated fitness and nutrition company.

He says that he would like to see venture capital go back to funding technical risk, and that for a lot of companies raising equity, 50-80% of their equity is going to Facebook and Google (via ad buys).<br /><br />He explains how Clearbanc is able to plug in to a startupâs finances to model and keep track of their progress in real time. Ali says that he would like to see founders taking the right kind of capital for their company's needs and talks about some of the perverse incentives in venture. Andrew points out that Clearbanc wants and needs all of their companies to succeed, which isnât always the case in venture.<br /><br />They talk about the moment that consumer goods are having and some of the insights Clearbanc has gleaned from amassing a ton of data via their investments in a ton of CPG companies. He says that because Clearbanc invests based on a company's metrics and not factors such as where the founder went to school or via introductions, they (without a mandate) have invested in 8X as many female founders as traditional VC. <br /><br />Finally, Andrew and Ali talk about how the funding landscape will evolve in the coming years, including what the big VC firms will do, what the aspirations for Clearbanc are, and whether tokens can be an effective form of financing.<br /><br />Quotable Lines From This Episode:<br /><br />"My perfect utopian future is: all of the money thatâs in venture capital goes to solving truly hard problems. Instead of MBAs running spreadsheets trying to figure out CAC to LTV, theyâre funding companies that are trying to cure cancer, develop flying cars, extend life, get us to the moonâ¦ Those are the outsized bets that equity is uniquely designed to fund." â Andrew<br /><br />"We have to get out of our heads the idea that the only types of capital in the world are seed, series A and series B rounds and start thinking about: whatâs the type of capital thatâs right for this situation?"  â Ali<br /><br />"I would love to see venture capital go back to funding technical risk. I would hope that people go back and look at 2018 and 2019 and say I canât believe that founders sold 50-80% of their companies before IPOs to pay for Facebook and Google ads. Youâre basically selling 50-80% of your company to Facebook and Google." â Andrew<br /><br />"Venture capital branded itself really well, right? You have these really smart people who put together these fancy websites and basically said that if you raise from XYZ firm, youâre going to be successful. We just sort of glamorize the whole asset. Itâs so fascinating that venture capital figured out a way to turn their capital into not a commodity. But it was this false promise. Itâs caused a lot of people to take on a lot of capital that they otherwise wouldnât have because of the social validation." â Ali<br /><br />"Imagine if in the public markets investors said, âyou should give me shares in GM at a lower rate because Iâm such a good investor.â VCs are intuiting a sort of causation and saying âhey, because I invested in Uber, it turned out to be great, rather than saying, hey, I was able to get into Uber and it was great.â  The promise of value-add from VCs often doesnât materialize and when it does, its something that you could probably get from independent advisors, and other people.

WeWork has even had trouble trying to add residential to their existing commercial business. <br /><br />They also talk about some of their requests for startups in the space and the unique structure of new investment vehicles, given that they are investing in both operating companies and real estate assets and receive returns on each of those investments in the same fund.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>2120</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/630a12ba98fbd4dcbfe8d4f74e66da0e.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>Lessons in Tech and Politics from âThe Fixer,â Bradley Tusk</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/lessons-in-tech-and-politics-from-the-fixer-bradley-tusk--17016213</link><description><![CDATA[Bradley Tusk (@bradleytusk) joins Erik on this episode to talk about the intersection of politics and tech. Heâs founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures and author of The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups From Death By Politics. Heâs also a philanthropist, political strategist, and hosts his own podcast, Firewall.<br /><br />Bradley has worked with Michael Bloomberg, Chuck Schumer, Uber, and many others. He shares the lessons heâs learned throughout his experience both working in politics and helping guide startups through the political and legislative processes. He explains the psyche of politicians and says that the actions of virtually every one is guided by whether it increases or decreases the chances of winning their next election. <br /><br />He talks about his work with Uber and how grassroots campaigns on behalf of startups with fervid customers can sway politicians to change existing regulations that tend to benefit entrenched interests. He discusses some of the best policies that legislators can implement to benefit startups and innovation and talks specifically about some of the areas that involve the overlap of governance and tech, including charter cities, co-living, and income-share agreements.<br /><br />He also talks what Silicon Valley misunderstands about politics, whether a Silicon Valley candidate could run in 2020, and how he is trying to increase voter participation through his foundationâs work on mobile and blockchain-powered voting. <br /><br />____<br /><br />Quotable Lines From This Episode<br /><br />âEvery single politician Iâve ever worked with, with the exception of Mike Bloomberg, is solely motivated by the next election, and if you can do something that makes them think theyâre going to lose the next election, or that you can do something to make them win the next election, theyâre going to do what you want â and if you canât do that it doesnât matter what you want.â<br /><br />âItâs especially hard with crypto and probably harder than any other sector â how do you regulate this thing that by design is meant to avoid federal currencies, avoid sovereignty, avoid nationality and is a reaction against all that?â<br /><br />âThe vast, vast majority of politicians, to be blunt, are desperately insecure, often self-loathing people who canât live without the validation of holding office and running for office and they will do anything to fill that hole in their psyche.â<br /><br />âIn my experience, the vast majority of journalists are just curious people who are trying to figure out in any given situation. Where people get into trouble is in trying to spin them.â<br /><br />âPeople in the Valley tend to not know what they donât know, meaning that because they are very intelligent and because they have had success in some areas in life, they assume that that is applicable to everything they can do.â<br /><br />âPolitics is its totally own world, totally own world language, totally own set of norms, and just because you were a really good engineer or you figured out how to market a product that you could figure out politics too, thatâs an incredibly dangerous assumption.â<br /><br />âThe naivetÃ© of people in the Valley in thinking that just because they attend political fundraisers and write checks that they have some level of understanding or influence over the process. They have none.â<br /><br />âThereâs no one in the Valley at the moment who could plausibly be a presidential candidate in 2020.â<br /><br />âYou look at issues in this country like guns or immigration or healthcare or climate change, most polls show that 70% of people agree on the basic tenets of what to do about this stuff, and then thereâs about 15% on either side that disagree but unfortunately right now the 15% on either side are the people that vote in primaries, so they really call the shots.â<br /><br />____<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/17016213</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2019 13:00:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/17016213/bradley_tusk.mp3" length="45657442" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Village Global</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Bradley Tusk (@bradleytusk) joins Erik on this episode to talk about the intersection of politics and tech.

They talk about a wide variety of topics, including mental models, cities, governance, travel, founding myths, and âwhy all of us are solely responsible for western civilization.â<br /><br />They start with mental models, talking about some of the most useful mental models Jd has seen and how he identifies new ones (a mental model for mental models, if you will). They transition to talking about cities and governance, including why the Bay Area has a housing crisis, why Jd is very long on Oakland, and the policies that he would import from the UK to fix housing in the Bay Area. Jd observes that cities always endure, even through disasters and massive changes in the nation states surrounding them. <br /><br />He talks about founding Opendoor, the importance of founding myths, and what heâs learned from Keith Rabois. He explains what you need to scale your company effectively and the difference between entrepreneurs and executives. He talks about some of his mental models for company building and why he says âplaybooks rule everything around me.â Jd also talks about taking a sabbatical and traveling around the world twice, but in his words âlearning nothing.â<br /><br />They talk about what Jd is looking for in his next opportunity and how he thinks about what to pick. He says that heâs looking at how to create the most good for the human race over a 1000 year time horizon and explains how Carroll Quigley convinced him that all of us are solely responsible for western civilization. They talk about snark as a contagion in the world today, which Jd says emerges when people donât feel empowered to make changes, so they fall back on sarcasm.<br /><br />They have a rapid-fire round where they talk about different people that Jd has learned from, and also play a game of long-short, where Erik names something (fitness cults, the Bay Area, etc.) and Jd says whether heâs long or short on it.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.

On this episode Erik is joined by Parker Thompson (@pt), partner at AngelList, and angel investor Dustin Dolginow (@dolginow).<br /><br />The trio discuss the past, present and future of scout programs. They start out by talking about Sequoiaâs creation of the scout program nearly ten years ago and why it was considered a âloss leaderâ for the firm, meaning that it generated goodwill and created a network, but the return on the deals was not actually very good. <br /><br />The three of them discuss some of the potential pitfalls of the scout program, whether it can create good returns on its own, and the similarities and differences of Villageâs Network Leader program to existing scout programs.<br /><br />Both Dustin and Parker have worked at AngelList, and the two discuss why AngelListâs model, which Parker calls a â1099 VC model.â They talk about how and when we might see a recreation of the consensus decision-making system that pervades the industry today and why that change is needed. They also talk about how someone seeking to get into venture or being a scout for a venture fund can do so.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/16554463</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 13:00:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/16554463/parker_t_and_dustin_dolgonow_scout_progrums.mp3" length="63235133" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Village Global</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>This episode is part of a three-part series taking listeners behind the curtain to discuss the inner workings of venture capital.

They also have a lightning round where Erik names an individual and Mark explains where he agrees and disagrees with that individualâs thinking.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>7797</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/630a12ba98fbd4dcbfe8d4f74e66da0e.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>The Present and Future of Autonomous Vehicles with Qasar Younis and Alexandr Wang</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/the-present-and-future-of-autonomous-vehicles-with-qasar-younis-and-alexandr-wang--16426473</link><description><![CDATA[On this episode of Venture Stories, Erik is joined by two exciting guests: Qasar Younis (@qasar), co-founder of Applied Intuition, and Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang), CEO of Scale.<br /><br />Both Qasar and Alex are creating software that is transforming the way autonomous vehicles are being developed.

They also tell us that the health industry is the single largest public employer and the single largest lobbyist in the country.<br /><br />They also talk about the possibility of using cryptocurrency in driving behavior change in patients, what the âremember blockchain?â eulogy for the tech might look like in 2030 if it doesnât pan out, how Apple, Amazon and Google getting involved in the space might change thing, and why days are (hopefully) numbered for companies whose business models are predicated on a lack of trust and transparency.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>3909</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/630a12ba98fbd4dcbfe8d4f74e66da0e.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>Rethinking The Merits of Decentralization with John Backus</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/rethinking-the-merits-of-decentralization-with-john-backus--16294797</link><description><![CDATA[On this episode of Venture Stories, Erik is joined by co-host Tony Sheng to interview John Backus (@backus), founder of Bloom and Cognito, two companies working on decentralized lending and identity.<br /><br />Co-host Tony Sheng (@tonysheng) leads product at Decentraland.

He founded The Seasteading Institute in 2008 with funding from Peter Thiel. His father is political theorist David Friedman and his grandfather is Nobel Laureate in economics, Milton Friedman.<br /><br />Over the course of their nearly two-hour conversation they cover a lot of ground, including crypto, physical (and virtual) governance, the current state of politics, Silicon Valley, and much more.<br /><br />Patri starts by explaining why he is both skeptical and optimistic about crypto â and why that position is not incompatible. He says that the tech boom around 2000 had âa lot of junkâ but a lot of innovation came out of it at the same time.<br /><br />He talks about starting The Seasteading Institute, the impetus behind the project and the successes and challenges they have had. He enumerates the issues with the structures of current countries, governments, and legal systems around the world and why by the logic of the market, one would expect countries and legal systems not to be very innovative. With experiments underway involving special economic zones incorporating novel legal systems, that might change.<br /><br />Patri explains what he means by the phrase âmarkets eating the worldâ and points out that platforms and sharing economy companies form half of of all current unicorns. He talks about how in the same fashion as software has been âeating the world,â he expects the same to happen with markets.

He founded The Seasteading Institute in 2008 with funding from Peter Thiel. His father is political theorist David Friedman and his grandfather is Nobel Laureate in economics, Milton Friedman.<br /><br />Over the course of their nearly two-hour conversation they cover a lot of ground, including crypto, physical (and virtual) governance, the current state of politics, Silicon Valley, and much more.<br /><br />Patri starts by explaining why he is both skeptical and optimistic about crypto â and why that position is not incompatible. He says that the tech boom around 2000 had âa lot of junkâ but a lot of innovation came out of it at the same time.<br /><br />He talks about starting The Seasteading Institute, the impetus behind the project and the successes and challenges they have had. He enumerates the issues with the structures of current countries, governments, and legal systems around the world and why by the logic of the market, one would expect countries and legal systems not to be very innovative. With experiments underway involving special economic zones incorporating novel legal systems, that might change.<br /><br />Patri explains what he means by the phrase âmarkets eating the worldâ and points out that platforms and sharing economy companies form half of of all current unicorns. He talks about how in the same fashion as software has been âeating the world,â he expects the same to happen with markets. He points out that the determination of resource allocation involves economics and trade-offs, whether done by a central figure or markets. He explains some of the novel uses of markets in unexpected areas and the two discuss some of the drawbacks and challenges with markets in delicate areas such as healthcare or education.<br /><br />He talks about some of the flaws present in democracy, including the idea that it provides citizens the illusion of control without providing any actual control and contrasts the potential distorted incentives of a central trusted authority figure versus a more decentralized market-driven approach of distributing resources. Patri says that he views the problem of figuring out the best kind of governance as an engineering problem requiring experimentation rather than a philosophical problem requiring deep thought and persuasion. <br /><br />They also talk about why he says in areas as varied as food, education and computing, our âdesires are being hijackedâ by profit-driven entities and why in the future it would be wise to return to more historically-proven strategies in those areas.

After graduation, Schmidt interned at both Xerox PARC and Bell Labs. He recounts stories of his time at the research labs and discusses to what extent the lab model does or doesnât work today. Cowen astutely points out that Schmidt is one of the few people around whose career spans several significant eras in the history of computing.<br /><br />They move on to talking about the early days at Google, where it turns out that Schmidt was hired to run the company after a skiing trip with Larry and Sergey, whose first concern in hiring âadult supervisionâ was to find someone they enjoyed hanging out with. Schmidt says that he initially assumed that search wasn't very important and that Googleâs ads didnât work. He reveals that during his first year he was so terrified that their "ruse would unravel" that he made anyone who wanted to spend money come to him personally on Fridays at 10am to justify the expense.<br /><br />Cowen asks about Schmidtâs insights on hiring and managing talent. Schmidt explains that in the beginning Larry and Sergey primarily hired their classmates and friends, but over time Googleâs hiring became highly structured. He tells the story of interviewing a single candidate 16 times and explains the logic of why initially they were so focused on school and GPA, rather than industry experience.<br /><br />Cowen and Schmidt also talk about in which areas even Schmidt himself has been surprised at the extent of technological progress and where he'd like to see more innovation. They discuss social media and why Schmidt says that it amplifies human weaknesses rather than strengths. The two of them also talk about transforming cities, including Alphabetâs Sidewalk Labs project in Toronto and the Bay Area's housing crisis.<br /><br />They of course also have a round of rapid-fire âoverrated vs. underrated,â covering subjects like Antarctica, Picasso, effective altruism, Yellowstone and North Korea. Cowen also asks his signature question about the Eric Schmidt "production function" and how Schmidt is able to be so productive.<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.

Rachel and Ed explain to us why theyâre excited and why they also have concerns and describe where they would be investing if they were running a venture capital fund.<br /><br />They talk about the continuing crossover of life sciences and technology tools, especially in software, and how the two worlds (one almost entirely regulated, the other entirely un-regulated) can better understand each other. <br /><br />They also talk about what their ârequests for productsâ are and give their advice for founders in the space, including this nugget from Rachel â ârun towards hard things and love complexity.â<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at <a href="http://www.villageglobal.vc" rel="noopener">www.villageglobal.vc</a> or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>2930</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/630a12ba98fbd4dcbfe8d4f74e66da0e.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>Crypto Stories: Jillian Carlson and Lily Liu on Emerging Markets, Token Business Models, and Self-ICOs</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/crypto-stories-jillian-carlson-and-lily-liu-on-emerging-markets-token-business-models-and-self-icos--15728284</link><description><![CDATA[Erik and his co-host Tony Sheng are joined by two special guests for this episode.

Lily's been thinking about how the blockchain can be used internationally and Jillian has been thinking about how to make blockchain and crypto actually useful to end users.<br /><br />They have a discussion of Venezuela and its effort to create a state-sponsored cryptocurrency.

Theyâre both equally important but the quarterback is much more sexy than the defense." -HW<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global, is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg and is produced by Brett Bolkowy.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>2436</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/630a12ba98fbd4dcbfe8d4f74e66da0e.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>Crypto Stories: A Primer on Crypto-Native Funds with Andrew Cronk, Jake Brukhman and Meher Roy</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/crypto-stories-a-primer-on-crypto-native-funds-with-andrew-cronk-jake-brukhman-and-meher-roy--15602539</link><description><![CDATA[Erik's guests for this episode are:<br /><br />- Andrew Cronk (@ajcronk), partner at Figment<br />- Meher Roy (@MeherRoy), co-founder of Chorus One<br />- Jake Brukhman (@jbrukh), founder of CoinFund<br /><br />They talk about a number of interesting topics, including the unique way that an investment firm participates in the growth of a company in the crypto world and why it's more important to be a network participant than just a funder.<br /><br />The four of them go through what a validator is and what being one entails.

He recounts the story of money from an Austrian perspective and describes why the world never really had a complete gold standard. Saif explains how government became addicted to printing money, how Bitcoin could turn out to be a better version of gold and how it might replace central banks entirely.<br /><br />Saif talks about why Silicon Valley has been and may still be mistaken about Bitcoin and blockchain, and why the analogies of the early days of the internet donât really apply. He also talks about why the blockchain as a concept has been overhyped and why Bitcoin wonât be as instantaneous and low-fee as you might think.<br /><br />He also talks about what kinds of threats Bitcoin might face, how the world will change when Bitcoin becomes the new standard, and how personal finance and capitalism might evolve in a Bitcoin world.<br /><br />(Murray Rothbard is the economist that Saif references early in the episode).<br /><br />Quotable lines from this episode:<br /><br />âYou canât omit the fact that you took a sledgehammer to the laptop before complaining that it doesnât work.â<br /><br />âEver since then itâs been a wild ride of governments having discovered this addiction to printing money to finance themselves to do everything.â<br /><br />âItâs a choice for people to opt-out of the modern nation state with all of its hefty bill that it sends you every year in the form of inflation.â<br /><br />âGoldâs emergence as a money happens on the market, not because of government decree.â<br /><br />âYou canât systematize human action and behavior into mathematical equations that allow you do calculations to predict an outcome.â<br /><br />âThe real problem is the fascination with all the buzzwords around all these projects that hang around Bitcoin pretending to be the next big thing, which weâve been seeing since the beginning of Bitcoin. Itâs the same story always and always ends in the same sad way.â<br /><br />âEverybody wants everything to do everything theyâve ever read in a sci-fi novel.â<br /><br />âEverybody is not capable of reasoning just beyond an analogy.â<br /><br />âPeople think of Bitcoin as a brandâ¦ and itâs only natural to think that if itâs Pepsi, itâs going to have its Coca-Cola â but we have the internet, and we donât have another competitor, because itâs a protocol.â<br /><br />âAll of these other uses that people want to attach to blockchain, I humbly submit the thesis that none of them actually matter.â<br /><br />âI donât conduct criminal activity but if I did I would definitely make sure I would not record it on a ledger accessible to millions of people instantaneously around the world.â<br /><br />âWithout a lender of last resort, fractional reserve banking is not going to work.â<br /><br />âEvery cent of investment will have to come from a cent of saving and people think thatâs a horrible thing, but thatâs a great thing, itâs how any society thrives.â<br /><br />âThe laws of economics donât stop functioning just because government just said they should stop functioning in that sector.â<br /><br />âCapital is just a market good like any other, thereâs supply and thereâs demand.â <br /><br />âThe amount of gold today that is held in global central banks is many times larger than what was held in central banks during the time of the gold standard.â<br /><br />âIf governments want to kill Bitcoin I think the best strategy would be to return to the gold standard and to offer everybody free markets in banking.â<br /><br />âI know itâs cool to go around on college campuses and talk about destroying capitalism and all of that stuff but really it makes no sense. Itâs an insane kind of suicidal death wish.â<br /><br />-<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.

He also talks about why the blockchain as a concept has been overhyped and why Bitcoin wonât be as instantaneous and low-fee as you might think.<br /><br />He also talks about what kinds of threats Bitcoin might face, how the world will change when Bitcoin becomes the new standard, and how personal finance and capitalism might evolve in a Bitcoin world.<br /><br />(Murray Rothbard is the economist that Saif references early in the episode).<br /><br />Quotable lines from this episode:<br /><br />âYou canât omit the fact that you took a sledgehammer to the laptop before complaining that it doesnât work.â<br /><br />âEver since then itâs been a wild ride of governments having discovered this addiction to printing money to finance themselves to do everything.â<br /><br />âItâs a choice for people to opt-out of the modern nation state with all of its hefty bill that it sends you every year in the form of inflation.â<br /><br />âGoldâs emergence as a money happens on the market, not because of government decree.â<br /><br />âYou canât systematize human action and behavior into mathematical equations that allow you do calculations to predict an outcome.â<br /><br />âThe real problem is the fascination with all the buzzwords around all these projects that hang around Bitcoin pretending to be the next big thing, which weâve been seeing since the beginning of Bitcoin. Itâs the same story always and always ends in the same sad way.â<br /><br />âEverybody wants everything to do everything theyâve ever read in a sci-fi novel.â<br /><br />âEverybody is not capable of reasoning just beyond an analogy.â<br /><br />âPeople think of Bitcoin as a brandâ¦ and itâs only natural to think that if itâs Pepsi, itâs going to have its Coca-Cola â but we have the internet, and we donât have another competitor, because itâs a protocol.â<br /><br />âAll of these other uses that people want to attach to blockchain, I humbly submit the thesis that none of them actually matter.â<br /><br />âI donât conduct criminal activity but if I did I would definitely make sure I would not record it on a ledger accessible to millions of people instantaneously around the world.â<br /><br />âWithout a lender of last resort, fractional reserve banking is not going to work.â<br /><br />âEvery cent of investment will have to come from a cent of saving and people think thatâs a horrible thing, but thatâs a great thing, itâs how any society thrives.â<br /><br />âThe laws of economics donât stop functioning just because government just said they should stop functioning in that sector.â<br /><br />âCapital is just a market good like any other, thereâs supply and thereâs demand.â <br /><br />âThe amount of gold today that is held in global central banks is many times larger than what was held in central banks during the time of the gold standard.â<br /><br />âIf governments want to kill Bitcoin I think the best strategy would be to return to the gold standard and to offer everybody free markets in banking.â<br /><br />âI know itâs cool to go around on college campuses and talk about destroying capitalism and all of that stuff but really it makes no sense. Itâs an insane kind of suicidal death wish.â<br /><br...]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>4850</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/630a12ba98fbd4dcbfe8d4f74e66da0e.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>Crypto Stories: Vijay Boyapati on Austrian Economics, Bitcoin and Monetary Policy</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/episode/crypto-stories-vijay-boyapati-on-austrian-economics-bitcoin-and-monetary-policy--15550393</link><description><![CDATA[Vijay Boyapati (@real_vijay), software engineer, crypto thinker and proponent of Austrian economics, joins Erik on this episode to talk about a number of interesting topics.<br /><br />They start with a primer on Austrian economics, what makes it different from other schools of economics, and why economics is a unique science with different schools of thought â âthere isnât a Chicago school of physics or a Marxist school of chemistry.â<br /><br />Vijay speculates on why Austrian economics has become a niche school of economics and analyzes Bitcoin and current economic policy through the lens of Austrian economics.

They discuss how the world will change as work and entertainment â but especially finance â become virtual. Balaji explains why governments will need to compete for the best individuals and explains the new role of government in a âborderlessâ world. <br /><br />He also discusses his recent exits and his new role as CTO of Coinbase. Balaji gives his surprising advice for new grads looking to start a company and explains why your âpersonal burn rateâ is one of the most important metrics to track.

He is a venture partner at Blockchain Capital and creator of the Programming Blockchain course. <br /><br />Jimmy has been a crypto developer for a long time now (in crypto terms), teaches programming blockchain, and has written a number of influential posts on crypto.

He explains how an economic lens, rather than a technical lens, is what brought him to blockchain.<br /><br />Jimmy and Erik discuss the merits of Bitcoin versus other coins, why Jimmy believes Bitcoin will win, and what misconceptions VCs have about blockchain. They discuss what makes a good store of value, the biological impulse humans have to hoard that which is scarce and the potential impact of Bitcoin 30 years from now.

He explains market makers in crypto, why he decided to build on top of 0x and discusses the pros and cons of a business built on another companyâs platform. <br /><br />They also discuss what the bottlenecks to widespread adoption of crypto are, what kinds of moats he hopes to build as well as what kinds of moats the incumbents in the traditional finance have.<br /><br />Quotable lines from this episode:<br /><br />âThe ethos around blockchain is about self-agency â itâs about efficacy.â<br /><br />âTalent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not.â<br /><br />âFor any cool project online there will always be those 1000 true fans, but if youâre not thinking deeply about how this crosses the chasm and how you get your next users, your project is probably going nowhere fast.â<br /><br />âI think most people underestimate the power of brand in the long term and overestimate it in the short term.â<br /><br />âA decentralized exchange is an imprecise term that people have been using as a noun when in fact it is a verb.â<br /><br />âWeâre moving a world where the centralized exchanges become fiat brokerages.â<br /><br />-<br /><br />Thanks for listening â if you like what you hear, please review us on your favorite podcast platform. <br /><br />Check us out on the web at villageglobal.vc or get in touch with us on Twitter @villageglobal.<br /><br />Venture Stories is brought to you by Village Global and is hosted by co-founder and partner, Erik Torenberg.
