      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of Barbarians at the Gate, hosts Jeremiah Jenne and David Moser interview Steven Schwankert about his groundbreaking research into the forgotten story of the Chinese survivors of the Titanic disaster. Schwankert, author of The Six: The Untold Story of the Titanic's Chinese Survivors, details how he uncovered the remarkable tale of six Chinese men who survived the sinking in 1912âa story largely erased from historical records.

The conversation explores how these third-class passengers achieved an extraordinary survival rate despite their disadvantaged position on the ship. Schwankert explains how their maritime experience as professional sailors working for the Donald Steamship line may have helped them make crucial life-saving decisions during the disaster.

We talk to Steve about the thorough detective work he and his team carried out researching the lives of the six surviving Chinese passengers, including their challenges in identifying Romanized Chinese names that had been misread for decades. They also got hands-on, using a full-scale replica of a Titanic collapsible lifeboat built by students and teachers from the Western Academy of Beijing to test historical claims about how the Chinese survivors escaped.

Throughout the episode, Schwankert addresses the discrimination and false narratives these men faced in the aftermath of the disaster, including libelous newspaper accounts claiming they had dressed as women or stowed away. The documentary based on this research received a wide theatrical release in China in 2021, bringing this important historical correction to audiences worldwide.

Finally, we discuss racism, official policy, and historical bias, as well as Steven and his teamâs work to recover the lost stories of the six Chinese men who survived the sinking of the Titanic.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[This week, we explore a topic close to our hearts: the world of jazz in China. Both Jeremiah and David bring their musical expertise to the tableâJeremiah as a rock and blues keyboardist, and David as an active pianist in Beijing's jazz scene.



David takes us back to his experiences in the 1980s, a period of renaissance for jazz in Beijing, when Chinese rock musicians began to discoverâor rediscoverâthis intricate Western genre. During China's early "Reform and Opening Up" era, musicians with little prior exposure to jazz and scarce recordings embarked on the challenging journey of mastering its fundamentals: the elusive "swing" rhythm, the art of improvisation over complex harmonies, and the pursuit of a unique musical "voice." For them, jazz represented a liberating contrast to the structured pop music of their youth, offering a sense of artistic freedom and boundless creativity.



David reports that a new generation of post-millennial jazz musicians has emerged who, having grown up with the genre, are quickly ascending to world-class status, gracing stages at prestigious international festivals.]]></description>

      <itunes:summary>&quot;We can overestimate and underestimate how much things changed when Xi Jinping took power, but the intensity of concern over historical narratives has definitely grown under his leadership.&quot; - Jeffrey WasserstromIn this episode, Jeremiah and David are joined by Jeffrey Wasserstrom (https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=5310), Chancellor's Professor of History at the University of California, Irvine, and a leading expert in modern Chinese history. We discuss the legacies of the Hong Kong protests, the rise of Xi Jinping's historical narrative control, and how academic engagement with China is evolving amidst growing geopolitical tensions.Professor Wasserstrom delves into the shifts in how history is managed in China, particularly the tightening control under Xi Jinpingâs regime. He elaborates on Xiâs new patriotic education law, which codifies the regime's control over historical narratives to align with national security. We also examine the challenges academics face when giving talks on sensitive topics and the growing restrictions on public discourse in Hong Kong since the imposition of the national security law.Further Reading/Links:* Jeffrey Wasserstrom, Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink * Maura Cunnigham and Jeffrey Wasserstrom, China in the 21st Century: What Everyone Needs to Know * Follow Jeffrey Wasserstrom on Twitter @jwassers (https://twitter.com/jwassers) </itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we welcome back to the podcast our good friend, Alec Ash, who has written a fascinating book recounting a year spent in the city of Dali, Yunan Province. Unlike Alecâs previous book,Â Wish Lanterns, his new book,Â The Mountains are High, is a highly personal account of his attempt to find solace and healing after a pivotal emotional crisis and his decision to disentangle himself from his urban Beijing life and escape to a simpler life in mountainous Yunnan Province. But Alecâs life in Dali was not completely hermitic. Quite the contrary, Alec found his new life interwoven with a peripatetic group of fellow escapees, a kaleidoscopic array of religious seekers, hippies, stoners, and disenchanted white-collar elites, all seeking solace or salvation through Buddhism, psychedelics, New Age mysticism, or just a simpler, more meaningful life. </p><p></p><p>We discuss the process of writing the book, the challenge of living off the grid, the struggle to resist the distracting allure of the Internet, and the hard work of transforming oneself to achieve a sense of contentment and peace.Â Â </p><p></p><p>Previous episodes featuring Alec Ash:</p><p></p><p>â<a href="https://blubrry.com/barbarians/68290990/chinas-new-youth/" style="background-color:transparent;">China's New Youth</a>â October 01, 2020</p><p></p><p>Â </p><p>â<a href="https://blubrry.com/barbarians/90904895/back-to-the-land-author-alec-ash-on-escaping-to-dali-rural-retreats-and-a-return-to-england/" style="background-color:transparent;">Back to the Land: Author Alec Ash on escaping to Dali, rural retreats, and a return to England</a>â October 30, 2022</p><p></p><p></p><p>Alecâs website information aboutÂ <a href="https://alecash.net/the-mountains-are-high" style="background-color:transparent;">The Mountains Are High</a></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of the podcast addresses a worrisome question: Is Chinaâs âcultural spaceâ shrinking? </p><p></p><p>The recent crackdown on stand-up comedy content and the scrutiny of foreign musicians performing in bars have raised worries that other artistic domains will soon be targeted. Over the past decade, there has been a perception of a âdeath by a thousand cuts,â as increasing scrutiny and tightening regulations have slowly sanitized, squelched, or strangled many areas of artistic and cultural expression. </p><p></p><p>The once vibrant LGBTQ scene in Beijing, characterized by thriving queer film festivals and active âtongzhiâ websites, is now virtually moribund. Venues such as the Bookworm, where freewheeling literary festivals and public talks were tacitly allowed, are now a thing of the past.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Fueled by too many red bulls (Jeremiah) and some pretty good pharmaceuticals following an emergency root canal (David), our intrepid cohosts throw caution to the wind and attempt to fix US-China Relations in a single podcast. For those outside of China, the ups and downs of this troubled bilateral relationship are sometimes felt as a rather abstract quandary. Still, for those of us who have invested decades of our lives in this China, the often juvenile skirmishes between the two superpowers have existential consequences. In this episode of BATG, Jeremiah and David describe the deterioration of US-China relations brought about by an ongoing series of reciprocal clashes. The conversation includes media bias, tit-for-tat sanctions and expulsions, what-about-ism, ideological silos, historical grudges, diplomatic standoffs, national humiliation, and âface,â -- all problems for which we provide absolutely no solutions, but for which ranting can be cathartic. Grab a red bull (or four) and/or your favorite pharmaceuticals and join the conversation.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this weekâs podcast, we are delighted and honored to talk to Melinda Liu, legendary journalist and long-time observer of post-Mao China. In addition to her long-time stint as Beijing Bureau Chief for Newsweek, Melinda has also covered the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the 1991 liberation of Kuwait, and the fall of Saddam Hussein. The conversation begins with updates on Chinaâs âzero Covidâ strategy against a backdrop of a new set of lockdowns in Beijing. Melinda then provides a journalistâs overview of the evolving censorship mechanism in China since Dengâs reforms, tracing the periods of relative openness and transparency and the increasing totalistic information control paradigm in the new era. Melinda also recounts the fascinating story of her fatherâs involvement during WWII as translator and go-between for the Doolittle Raiders, the small group of American pilots who conducted a bombing raid in Tokyo and were forced to land in an occupied area of China.</p>]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years of Covid-19 chaos, political upheavals, climate change disasters, and economic downturns have triggered an increasing lack of faith in government institutions worldwide. The United States, in particular, has seen trust in government plummet, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/americans-views-of-government-decades-of-distrust-enduring-support-for-its-role/">a Pew report indicating that American confidence in government has fallen to a historic low of 20%</a>. According to a report from the public relations firm Edelman, China might seem to be an exception to this trend. <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2022-trust-barometer/trust-china">The Edelman report put Chinese citizensâ trust in their government at a record 91 percent, the highest rate in a decade</a>. But recent outbursts of angry protests by Shanghai citizens suffering under extended Covid-19 lockdowns suggest a different story. How much faith do the Chinese people have in their government? Is Chinese nationalism still riding a wave of increasing economic prosperity, or is the Chinese model losing its luster among average citizens? How is the role of government viewed differently in the United States and China? In this episode, we welcome communications and content specialist Zhang Yajun, co-host of the <a href="https://www.womenpodcast.net/">WÇMEN podcast</a>, to explore these issues of government accountability and public trust in the Chinese and US context.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:summary>In this weekâs episode, we talk with Jean Hoffmann Lewanda about her father Paul Hoffmannâs memoir,Â Witness to History: From Vienna to Shanghai: A Memoir of Escape, Survival and Resilience, recently published by Earnshaw Books.Â Paul Hoffmann left Vienna at the age of 18 to escape the rise of Nazism, arrived in Shanghai in 1938, and became a part of the historic stream of Jewish refugees who found a haven in China during WWII. His memoirs describe the harsh living conditions in the Hongkou Ghetto during the Japanese occupation and the lifestyles of the multicultural, multinational community in Shanghai.Â Paul eked out a living teaching English and mathematics while obtaining a law degree from Aurora University (currently Fudan University). He worked for the American lawyer Norwood Allman (who was secretly the US spy chief in China (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ND2LUKQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1)). Paul remained in China during the communist takeover in 1949, managing the dissolution of his law firm, and witnessed firsthand the harassment, imprisonment, and expulsions to which the foreign community was subjected.Â After rediscovering her fatherâs memoirs, Jean Hoffmann Lewanda edited the text, weaving in the various photographs and documents Paul left behind. The result isÂ Witness to History, a gripping and sometimes harrowing memoir of a man who was caught up in the tides of one of the most tumultuous periods in history and lived to tell the story.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Jeremiah and David talk about the foreign experience of travel in China, drawing upon their personal experiences over the years as explorers, educators, and tour guides. The two trade accounts of the rapid expansion of Chinaâs travel industry in decades after Reform and Opening, the occasional brushes with anti-foreign sentiment, and the exploding domestic luxury travel market as the economy booms and overseas travel has been restricted. The discussion also turns to the new post-Covid-19 reality of quarantines, vaccination records, and issues with the ubiquitous health-record apps that have become mandatory additions to everyoneâs mobile phone.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode (taped on the eve of June 4th), Jeremiah and David examine the zeitgeist of China in the 1980s through the lens of the historic 1988 documentary River Elegyãæ²³æ®ã. The six-part documentary was a scathing critique of Chinese traditional culture and political philosophy, portraying hallowed icons such as the Great Wall and the Yellow River as morally repugnant symbols of barbarism and cultural self-deception. The TV series also touched upon previously taboo topics such as Mao's Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The documentary was highly controversial at the time yet was widely disseminated in State media such as the People's Daily, giving rise to an astonishingly frank public debate about the fate of China and the need for economic and political liberalization. The documentary was banned after 1989 but remains a cultural time capsule of the decade's relatively open political discourse. The podcast discussion examines the contentious intellectual currents of the 1980s and poses some counterfactual questions about how China's reforms might have progressed if the free-thinking trajectory of River Elegy had continued to exert an influence.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the show this week, Jeremiah and David dialogue about one of their long-term common missions: educating American study abroad students about the complex culture and politics of China. With the rise of the PRC as an economic power, it has always been vitally important to get American scholars to this country to gain first-hand experience with the language and culture. Yet, It has always been a challenge to establish and maintain study abroad programs in China. For decades there had always been a significant disparity between the number of Chinese students in the US vs. American students in China, but now with rising US-China tensions and the onslaught of Covid-19, the China study abroad student has become somewhat of an endangered species. The pre-Covid number of Chinese students in the US studying for undergraduate and graduate degrees had increased to about 370,000 by 2019. By contrast, the number of American students studying in China, after a brief spike prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, had declined to a mere 11,000 in the 2017-18 school year. Jeremiah and David reminisce about their experience teaching US students in Beijing, discuss the geopolitical importance of fostering a China-savvy cohort of American scholars entering the US workforce, and explore possible strategies and models for building China study programs in the post-Covid world.</p>

Matthew covers topics such as the preservationist Liang Sicheng's abandoned vision for the Old City and the city wall, the botched renovation schemes for areas such as Qianmen and Dashilanr, the waves of demolition and evictions in the hutong neighborhoods of Dongcheng and Xicheng, as well as the ongoing municipal project to renovate and revitalize the city's abandoned industrial sites, such as the Shougang Iron and Steel Works, into Olympic venues.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Following on the previous BATG episode about the Chinese education system, in this installment, Jeremiah and David are pleased to continue this discussion with award-winning journalist and author Lenora Chu. Lenora is the author of Little Soldiers: An American Boy, a Chinese School and the Global Race to Achieve, a melding of memoir and journalism that brings to light the enormous cultural differences between the Chinese and American education systems. In recounting the sometimes traumatic adjustments of her young son to the academic environment of an elite Shanghai elementary school, Chu explores the complex web of social conditioning and parental cooperation that results in the high-achieving âlittle soldiersâ in the Chinese system and weighs the advantages and disadvantages of the East and West educational models. The conversation also touches on the gaokao, the controversial college entrance exam, the supposed âcreativity gapâ in the Chinese model, and the similarities in the phenomenon of âhelicopter parentsâ in the two cultures. As a commentator, Chu has appeared on NPR, CBS, BBC, and the CBC, and her articles and op-eds have been published in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Cut, and Business Insider, among others.</p>

<p>Historian James Carter's fascinating new book <i><a target="_blank" href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393635942">Champions Day: The End of Old Shanghai</a> </i>brings to life the vivid tableau of an era coming to an end. By the end of the year, Japanese authorities would take control of Shanghai and the city would never again be the same. What did the end of the colonial era mean for Shanghai and its residents? Why were race tracks such powerful symbols?</p>
<p>Professor Carter joins us as we discuss the history of horse racing, colonialism, and the last days of Old Shanghai.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Champions Day in the city of Shanghai, November 1941. The world was at war but the clubhouse at the Shanghai Race Club (now People's Park) was packed with owners and punters cheering on the pony. The funeral of Shanghai's richest widow, Liza Hardoon, was a spectacle which filled the streets of the International Settlement. Japanese occupiers and their Chinese collaborators came together in a bizarre ritual celebrated the birthday of revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen. The opening of a new movie featuring, of all subjects, Charlie Chan, had folks lining up at the box office of the local cinema. The world had changed but the &quot;Lone Island&quot; of Shanghai persisted, as it had since becoming a treaty port a century earlier.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we look at Putonghua, the spoken language most people refer to as Mandarin. David wrote a book in 2016 on the evolution of Putonghua in China and we discuss his research and the recent controversy over the app Douyin penalizing users who post videos in other Chinese languages, especially Cantonese. What's the point of Putonghua? What is a dialect and what is a language in China? And what's the difference between Mandarin in the Qing Dynasty, Guoyu in the Republican Period, and Putonghua in the PRC? We also get an assist from Zhang Yajun, host of the Wo Men Podcast on Radii China, who talks with David about the differences between the spoken language of Northern China, especially around Beijing, and "Standard" Putonghua.</p>
<p>It's not just for Chinese speakers or students as we also tackle some tricky questions of competing national and regional identities in Chinese history.</p>

Jeremiah and David then reflect on their time as teachers here working with international university students studying in Beijing and discuss the closing of the remaining pockets of relative academic freedom that once existed. Finally, as the Chinese government expels foreign journalists and some stores and bars in China literally have closed their doors to foreigners, Jeremiah and David ask: Are we still welcome here?</p>
<p>Ps. We're still getting the hang of taping from two different locations. At about 20 minutes or so, Jeremiah's mic levels jump a few decibels. You may want to turn down the volume at that point. We'll get this right eventually.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[The outbreak of Covid-19 has drawn attention to public health in China and around the world. In the early stages, there was considerable criticism of China's initial handling of the outbreak. This criticism drew an emotional response in China. In this episode of Barbarians at the Gate, Jeremiah Jenne and David Moser look at the intimate link in Chinese history between public health, hygiene, and modernity.

Note: In the podcast, we mention China's expulsion of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-expels-three-wall-street-journal-reporters-11582100355">Wall Street Journal reporters Josh Chin, Chao Deng, and Philip Wen</a>. Since we taped the podcast, the situation has escalated and last week the government pulled the press cards of all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/media/china-expels-american-journalists.html">US citizens working as reporters in China for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post</a>. Local employees at those bureaus <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c5cfe8f8-6bf4-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f">have also been pressured to leave their jobs</a>. We donât mention those events here, but we will be discussing the situation on an upcoming podcast.
