      <title>Breaking Down AI Biases</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Does your health insurance chatbot need to tell jokes? No. Does it need to be accurate? Absolutely. That's hard when biases get in the way. 

The introduction of bias into a model can be unintentional, but it can have significant consequences for those relying on its guidance. The Compiler team examines the ways bias can creep in, and what steps can be taken to address it.

      <description><![CDATA[AI is notorious for making stuff up. But it doesn’t always tell you when it does. That’s a problem for users who may not realize hallucinations are possible. 

This episode of Compiler investigates the persistent problem of AI Hallucination. Why does AI lie? Do these AI models know they’re hallucinating? What can we do to minimize hallucinations—or at least get better at seeing them?

      <title>From CodeNewbie: The new wave of frontend developer tools are on their way</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Compiler is on a holiday break and will return in January 2023—but we're sharing an episode made by our friends at CodeNewbie that we think you'll like:

To welcome back our show for Season 22, we talk with a familiar face to the CodeNewbie Podcast, Chris Ferdinandi. Chris is the author of the Vanilla JS Pocket Guide series and the creator of the Vanilla JS Academy training program. On today's episode, Chris talks about what he's learned since coming on the show in 2020, how he sees the future of frontend development evolving over the next few years, and what tools might help in your next job search.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We reach our penultimate episode for Stack/Unstuck, and arrive on the topic of testing. Testing isn’t necessarily part of any technology stack, but it is a vital part of building software. Sometimes, it can feel like testing is an afterthought, or just a box for busy coders to tick once completed.<br /><br />We hear from our guests about how testing doesn’t need to be saved for a curtain call. It can have a starring role when identifying problems within different components of a software stack. And as we include it more in discussions and planning, and as we start thinking about it earlier in development cycles, testing can further an application’s potential, and help teams build software better.</p>

      <title>The Overlooked Operating System</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The operating system wars are over. We’re still left with Windows, Linux, and MacOS—along with Android and iOS. Many argue that there’s little left to accomplish with the bottom of the software stack. But work on the OS is far from over. <br /><br />The kernel and user space provide the literal foundation for the rest of the software stack. Drivers, networking, and countless other features are abstracted away as common resources so the other layers of the stack can focus on their own functions. So when the overlooked layer gets an upgrade, it can really make a difference.<br /> </p>

      <itunes:summary>The operating system wars are over. We’re still left with Windows, Linux, and MacOS—along with Android and iOS. Many argue that there’s little left to accomplish with the bottom of the software stack. But work on the OS is far from over. 

The kernel and user space provide the literal foundation for the rest of the software stack. Drivers, networking, and countless other features are abstracted away as common resources so the other layers of the stack can focus on their own functions.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Writing data is easy. You take in the information and put it away for future use. It’s remembering exactly what you wrote and where you put it that’s the challenge. Just like having to look for your keys as you try to rush out the door, getting that data quickly makes all the difference. And when your database is your bestie, it can serve that information faster than you could imagine. <br /><br />Getting a database into shape takes specialized skills. From planning and development to maintenance and rebuilding, it’s a layer of the stack that needs constant attention and evaluation. It can be a performance booster—or an efficiency bottleneck.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Frameworks exist to make building apps easier, and there are a lot to choose from. We hear from one long-time Java developer about his passion project, an app designed to remind users of important deadlines and appointments. We explore his app’s framework—how he chose it, and how things changed along the way.<br /><br />While they are there to help developers build applications very quickly, frameworks shouldn’t be seen as a salve or a substitute for basic knowledge. When things go awry, that’s when knowing the fundamentals can help, whether you are building applications on your own, or working on a larger team.</p>

      <title>The Fractious Front End</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Front-end development can be complex—and that means a front-end developer’s skills are essential, albeit constantly shifting. But a humble web search can produce various memes and jokes about how the front end isn’t as much of an endeavor as other parts of an application can be. <br /><br />Expanding knowledge beyond one’s area of the software stack can strengthen the skills they have, but negative perceptions can become a barrier to building those necessary relationships. As communities and companies grow, though, attitudes can begin to change. How can front-end developers communicate their expertise to their peers, and learn new talents along the way?</p>

      <title>Are Big Mistakes That Big Of A Deal?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Oops. We all make mistakes. Most of the time, they’re small enough no one notices. But every now and then, we do something that makes us break into a cold sweat. The “Oops” becomes a curse, desperate pleas—or horrified silence as we process what just happened. In the moment, they’re panic-inducing. But once the dust settles, are those big mistakes that big of a deal?<br /><br />On this episode of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast" target="_blank">Compiler</a>, we hear three stories of people who wish they had an easy undo button. But making those mistakes taught them all something important—and changed how they do their jobs. Because those big mistakes end up being valuable lessons for the rest of their careers.<br /> </p>

      <title>How Does Data Help Shape Movies?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Movies are culturally important. They transform language and communication. Motion pictures present fantasy worlds we can get lost in, helping us understand the world differently. Discussing data and movies can make the fantasy seem…a little less fantastic. It can feel sterile, mass produced, and devoid of imagination. <br /><br />But data is vital, both for those behind the camera and those sitting in theaters (or at home). This episode will cover some ways data science and machine learning can inform filmmaking, from conception to post-production.</p>

      <title>How Do We Make Updates Less Annoying?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Updates. They take time out of your day and your devices out of commission. That’s about the extent of it for an end user. But for organizations? Updating their systems is a big deal. And forgoing regular updates is a recipe for disaster. <br /><br />“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” isn’t a good option for enterprise IT. Your system may keep running but if you haven’t updated in awhile, you may be missing some stability and performance improvements—and probably some security patches too. Regularly updating is a good habit. How do we make it less annoying?<br /> </p>

      <title>When Should Data Die?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We have a finite time on earth. But the data we generate? It can last much, much longer. We have limited control over what happens to our data during our lives. And while you might not care about anything when you’re gone, you and your loved ones might have an interest in how your information is used after you pass. So we wondered: When should data die? 

It’s a tricky question. In the digital age, individuals generate mountains of data over their lifetimes. But who has the right to decide whether that data remains, or when it is deleted? How should IT organizations handle their datasets given the complexities of privacy, legacy, and ownership that they need to consider?

It’s already difficult to choose the right path for a project without the pressure to be clairvoyant. But everyone wants to feel like they are leading the pack on the next big thing. <br /><br />What do we need to know to make a good prediction for where technology is headed? Alternatively, what do we need to know to avoid the wrong choice? We speak to experts in the DevOps space about betting wrong on the future, how development projects go awry, and what teams can do to get things back on track. <br /> </p>

      <title>Who&apos;s Afraid Of Compilers?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s about time we asked a question about compilers. It’s been a scary proposition. Compilers have a reputation for density, complexity, and a fair bit of mysticism.

      <title>How Do Roads Become Smarter?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Traffic jams and congested streets are an annoyance many people have to endure. Turns out, the same technology keeping us constantly connected—the Internet of Things—can also improve how we move people and things from place to place. But what are the considerations for technologists? Connectivity can’t be the only piece of the puzzle. Smart road technology can make travel safer, easier, and more efficient. But how can it make travel enjoyable?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Computer literacy is supposedly coming naturally to younger generations who seem to be born with smartphones in their hands. But there’s a difference between tech familiarity and actually knowing how technology works. And when kids learn about the wide world of IT, what else are they learning? <br /><br />Kids know tech is everywhere.

      <title>How Can Memes Improve Security?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Memes are goofy. They’re easily recognizable. And they’re often used to make a point. So it’s no wonder that people on both sides of the InfoSec community are not only familiar with memes, but often use them in their endless games of cat and mouse. Consequently, memes are often a sign of a breach of security. Because there’s little as satisfying as leaving a meme as proof of your security prowess. <br /><br />On this episode of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast" target="_blank">Compiler</a>, we hear from a couple of Red Hatters who rose to an unusual security challenge. And while intentions were good, the memes could have easily been something much more nefarious.<br /> </p>

      <title>What&apos;s The Recipe For Burnout?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Working on a popular open source project can be demanding. Just ask the maintainers on GitHub’s ReadME podcast. In a special episode of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast/burnout-recipe" target="_blank">Compiler</a>, we teamed up with ReadME’s Brian Douglas to learn more about the challenges open source maintainers face—and investigate why burnout seems to be so prevalent in the industry. </p><p>Burnout’s always going to be a problem. But we can still try to avoid it. To do so, we wanted to understand the recipe for burnout: what factors could we identify that seem to bring it about?

Traditionally, if someone wanted a career in tech, they had to make the move to one of these cities.

      <title>Do We Still Need Strong Copyleft Licenses?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s a good idea to understand the open source licenses governing the projects you use. Luckily, it’s less daunting than you may think. We start with the very basics of copyright and move to open source and the difference between permissive and copyleft licenses—and how they govern the world of open source software. <br /><br />But we learn how these distinctions may not be as relevant as they once were. The landscape of tech is changing. Developer culture isn’t what it used to be—and neither is how we consume software. On this episode of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast" target="_blank">Compiler</a>, we ask: Do we still need strong copyleft licenses?</p>

      <title>Can Superstitions Solve Technical Problems?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We all know not to walk under a ladder. Or break a mirror. Or do anything that may incur the wrath of the paranormal. Superstitions linger, even in places you may not expect. The devices, software, and general technology we use every day spring from the progression of science. But that doesn’t stop us from coming up with new superstitions. <br /><br />From blowing into cartridges to waving cell phones in the air, we’ve come up with some fixes that technically don’t make a lot of sense. This week on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast/superstitions" target="_blank">Compiler</a>, we ask a few people from tech support whether superstitions have a useful role in solving our technical difficulties.<br /> </p>

      <title>Do We Want a World Without Technical Debt?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Software development teams often reach a crossroads. Should they perform maintenance and address bug issues, or add new features to satisfy users? The former isn’t as exciting, but sometimes the most important work is invisible to those who reap the benefits.<br /><br />For now, the project has been released, and everyone wants to celebrate. But there’s an elephant in the room, one that teams can ignore—at least, for a while. This week on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast" target="_blank">Compiler</a>, we unpack the concept of technical debt, and wonder if there is a world where it doesn’t exist. </p>

If you’ve ever dealt with input delay, or wrestled with lag, you know how important a quality connection is in online gaming. But with edge computing on the horizon, what impact might there be on how we play? <br /><br />The internet, as we’ve explored in past seasons of Command Line Heroes, is a patchwork of international agreements and varying infrastructure.

      <title>Should Managers Code?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Becoming a manager can be a triumphant milestone of working life. It’s often a recognition of leadership and, in the tech industry, technical skill. Many argue those skills necessarily become casualties to the management track. But it’s hard to let go of your creative side to make room for managing others. Can they do both? Should managers code? It’s an old question that never seems to receive a clear answer. <br /><br />From the Red Hat offices to the moons of Jupiter, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast" target="_blank">Compiler</a> explores why it’s such a complex issue. We spoke with Red Hatters who are vocal about what role, if any, managers have in the code base—and why they fight to keep their hands on keys for as long as they can. <br /> </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becoming a manager can be a triumphant milestone of working life. It’s often a recognition of leadership and, in the tech industry, technical skill.
