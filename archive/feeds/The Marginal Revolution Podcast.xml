			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the final episode of Season 1, Alex and Tyler explore one of the most consequential quests in the history of economics and finance: the decades-long search for a formula to price options. From Louis Bachelier's groundbreaking work in 1900 to the eventual triumph of Black, Scholes, and Merton in the 1970s, they trace how brilliant minds across mathematics, physics, and economics gradually unlocked the how to properly price financial instruments like calls and puts. Along the way, they examine how this theoretical breakthrough revolutionized modern markets, sparked the creation of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and transformed our understanding of uncertainty and risk management. The conversation ranges from the hidden histories of early options traders to how options theory now shapes everything from portfolio insurance to oil well investments to mega-sized chip plants. They close by reflecting on how options theory has become fundamental to modern decision-making far beyond trading floors, revolutionizing how we think about and manage uncertainty across the entire economy.</p> <p>Transcript and links: <a href= "https://www.mercatus.org/marginal-revolution-podcast/quest-price-options"> https://www.mercatus.org/marginal-revolution-podcast/quest-price-options</a></p> <p>Stay connected:</p> <ul> <li>Follow Alex on X: <a href= "https://x.com/ATabarrok">https://x.com/ATabarrok</a></li> <li>Follow Tyler on X: <a href= "https://x.com/tylercowen">https://x.com/tylercowen</a></li> </ul> <p>See Alex and Tyler's recent posts on Marginal Revolution: <a href= "https://marginalrevolution.com/">https://marginalrevolution.com/</a></p> <p>Chapters</p> <ul> <li>00:00 - The puzzle of pricing options</li> <li>03:46 - Louis Bachelier's contribution</li> <li>09:52 - Enter Paul Samuelson</li> <li>15:05 - Black, Scholes, and Merton</li> <li>27:05 - Kassouf, Thorp, and cashing in on options theory</li> <li>32:28 - Other applications of options pricing theory</li> </ul> <p>Recorded 4/12/2024</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this exploration of the "new monetary economics," Alex and Tyler revisit the ideas of thinkers like Fischer Black, Eugene Fama, and Robert Hall, whose bold views about the Fed and the money supply once seemed detached from reality but now increasingly describe the financial world we inhabit. They explore why traditional measures like the money supply are becoming obsolete, how crypto and stablecoins are reshaping monetary systems, and why AI might emerge as a major consumer—and creator—of cryptocurrencies. They also discuss the paradox of pegged currencies, the lessons of algorithmic stablecoin failures like Terra, and the surprising connections between fiscal and monetary policy in a world of increasingly liquid assets. Finally, they reflect on how the unconventional ideas of new monetary economics, once dismissed as fringe, are now critical for understanding our modern financial landscape.</p> <p>Recorded March 14, 2024</p> <p>Transcript, video, and links:  <a href= "https://www.mercatus.org/marginal-revolution-podcast/new-monetary-economics"> https://www.mercatus.org/marginal-revolution-podcast/new-monetary-economics</a></p> <p>Chapters</p> <ul> <li>00:00 - Outlining the ideas of new monetary economics</li> <li>09:03 - The difficulty of defining the money supply</li> <li>17:36 - What determines the inflation rate?</li> <li>22:32 - Crypto's role in validating new monetary economics</li> <li>26:02 - The role of the Fed in a Modigliani-Miller world</li> <li>32:09 - Stablecoins and the paradox of pegs</li> <li>46:11 - The bottom line</li> </ul> <p>Stay connected:</p> <ul> <li>Follow Alex on X: <a href= "https://x.com/ATabarrok">https://x.com/ATabarrok</a></li> <li>Follow Tyler on X: <a href= "https://x.com/tylercowen">https://x.com/tylercowen</a></li> <li>See Alex and Tyler's recent posts on Marginal Revolution: <a href= "https://marginalrevolution.com/">https://marginalrevolution.com/</a></li> </ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this final installment of their series on the 1970s, Alex and Tyler turn to the social upheaval and crime wave that marked the decade as one of America’s most turbulent.

From the shocking statistics on homicide and stranger violence to the rise of serial killers and political bombings, they consider how the era’s unprecedented violence influenced American culture and policy.
