      <description>In this episode, Tobi talks with Georg Zoeller, Co-Founder of the Centre for AI Leadership and mercenaries.ai, about the turbulent landscape of AI. Georg, with his background at Meta and deep expertise in AI strategy, cuts through the hype surrounding AI's capabilities and economic impact.



They discuss the 'singularity' we're already in, driven by rapid, open-source AI development, and why this makes future predictions impossible. Georg argues that software engineering is being commoditized due to the vast amount of training data available (Stack Overflow, GitHub), making AI adept at code generation but raising profound security concerns like prompt injection.



Explore:
 - Why Georg believes blindly adopting AI early is a 'terrible mistake' for most companies.
 - The fundamental security flaws in LLMs (prompt injection) and why they're currently unsolvable for open input spaces.
 - The questionable economics of AI: high costs, self-cannibalizing business models, and the reliance on performative fundraising.
 - How AI tools impact engineer productivity, shifting the bottleneck to decision-making and validation.
 - The geopolitical risks and diminishing trust associated with Big Tech's AI dominance.
 - Actionable advice for CTOs: Invest in understanding, focus on governance beyond the tech team, and consider the strategic value of local/open-source alternatives.</description>

<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<ul>
<li>"We can work really fast on the wrong thing.  But are we actually working on the thing that the business values?  And so I think that's a really key part of the productivity conversation that maybe has been missing in the past is: Are we doing the right things?</li>
<li>"The utility that an individual engineer can provide will decrease over time if you aren't tackling that constant increase in complexity."</li>
<li>"I don't [know] how to make that message any easier to hear.  It really is a question of “do you want to hit this quarter's goals, or do you want to have a sustainable business in two years?’ It's a constant balance between those. I think understanding that those two things are in tension and that *when you are just optimizing for the quarter, you are de-optimizing for the future. *Those two things need to be in balance so that you are continuing to create a sustainable environment for creating more value, right? An environment where you can keep creating value. If you are only creating value and not  gardening the environment, then eventually you will not have an environment where you can create value. "</li>

      <description>Want to become a better manager? Then manage yourself better! 

From managing the time you spend managing, and all the way to managing how you give your team new tasks...

Let's get real with Johanna Rothman, whom they don’t call the Pragmatic Manager for nothing.  You will love her straight-talking approach to management. After almost 40 years in management, she can boil down things to sharp principles that will make you either hand pump💯,  shoot the link to your buddy🤣… or smile sheepishly🫣. Yip, she got you. (Don’t worry, we won’t judge. Patterns exist because everyone does them. Which is why we need people who have been around the block to call us out 📢on them).
Listen to find out:
- Why you need to manage yourself to better manage others
- Micromanagement: A recipe for multitasking chaos🤯 and WIP overload.
- Why Gantt Charts are bad👎. Use Flow Metrics and PERT instead.
- Who actually needs to be in the C-Suite (HINT: Not 25 people 🤣)
- + how things have changed since the 70s: from the CTO Role to Feedback loops.

  <p>And when we're talking about autonomy within companies,  you should understand that <strong>you're trying to give every person the most autonomy they can handle at a given point in time</strong> ….. And so what you're looking at saying is how much autonomy can you handle right now? And how do we put you in a situation where the bits where you don't have autonomy over what you're learning from so that your ability to tackle larger and more difficult things grows over time?  And what tends to happen with autonomy as we don't have that conversation? So  when somebody feels that they don't have appropriate decision-making power, they turn around and say, ‘You're not giving me autonomy ‘like it's necessarily a bad thing rather than the better conversation of ‘what level autonomy should you have at this point and how can we help you grow that level of autonomy’” - Andy Walker,alphalist CTO podcast #91</p>
  <p>One of my rules of thumb as to whether I'm functioning as a leader was,” How many decisions do I have to make?” And my goal is to never have to make a single decision. This is a futile goal, because that's never going to happen. But it makes me think about <strong>how do I push the decision to the lowest part of the hierarchy as possible, so that the people closest to the work are able to have agency over what they're doing.</strong>  And this should be business as usual. And in fact, if you're working on something, and you're responsible for getting it done,  you should have decision-making power over 99 percent of the things in front of you.  The interesting case is the edge case for that 1 percent where what you're working on may be mutually exclusive to another team. ” - Andy Walker,alphalist CTO podcast #91</p>

<p>About Bob Moesta:
BOB MOESTA is a teacher, builder, entrepreneur, and co-founder at <a href="https://therewiredgroup.com?utm_source=alphalist&utm_medium=referral">The Re-Wired Group</a>, a design firm in Detroit, Michigan. Bob has developed &amp; launched over 3,500 products and sold everything from design services, software, and houses to consumer electronics, and investment services.

<p>QUOTES:
"Well, if you think about it, 70% of our life cycle costs are fixed in the first 10% of how we develop and set up a new platform. 
And yet we spend all the money usually on the backend.  And we don't spend that time upfront thinking.
And so the more we can spend that time upfront thinking about the right things in the boundaries and understanding kind of the limitations, we then will actually have a better understanding of what to build and what to know." </p>

<p>I'm joined today by Stephen Wolfram, the founder of Wolfram Alpha, a physicist, mathematician and IT expert. We discuss Stephen's life-long passion of understanding the world computationally and how that has led to the development of Wolfram Language, a language intended for both humans to think in and for computers to read. We explore the practical uses of Wolfram Language and the impact it has had on enterprise systems and consumer transactions.

<p>Stephen Wolfram and I discuss the challenges of streaming live events, the emergence of Grafana and Kubernetes, and the benefits of running own infrastructure. We explore the option of running the system in AWS or other virtualization platforms, and the difficulties in containerizing the system. We look at the diurnal rhythm of traffic and discuss the advantages of running our own operation. Finally, we discuss Wolfram Alpha and the ChatGPT's Wolfram Plug-in, and the new Chat Notebook feature.</p>
<p>(0:19:19) - Software Development in a Chat-Based World </p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram and I explore how to do software development in a world where chat is not reproducible. We examine how to extract useful information from chat conversations, how to version individual steps, and how writing specs in natural language may not be precise enough. We also discuss the unique advantages of Wolfram Language, which was designed to be read as it is written by humans, and how the LLM (Large Language Model) can summarize what is happening with the code beyond what a human could see. This is a novel concept in modern workflow and we consider the implications of this.</p>
<p>(0:31:49) - The Intersection of Technology and Judgment </p>
<p>We examine the implications of the emergence of language models for the future of AI and the impact they may have on the industry. We discuss how the advancements in language models may not be as revolutionary as initially thought, and that the real value for language models may come from the tooling and use cases that develop from them. We also explore the concept of 'technology meeting judgement', and how this has been seen before in the history of the technology industry.</p>
<p>(0:45:53) - The AI-aided CTO role </p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram and I explore the potential of language models and their impact on AI. We discuss how language models can help automate certain tasks and offer guidance to humans. We examine how these models can be used to teach humans to solve well-defined problems and what skills are necessary for a CTO to manage the combination of mission, automation, and people. Finally, we discuss the importance of strategy in the success of any effort.</p>
<p>(0:59:13) - Leveraging all types of Langauge Models (Not just LLMs) </p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram and I discuss how language models can be used to bridge the gap between a company's individual data and public data. We explore the potential of language models, and how they can be used to answer natural language queries and automate certain tasks. We also look at the concept of making companies computable by using language models to read documentation and build an ERP system from existing data.</p>
<p>(1:06:29) - Computational Invention and Exploration</p>
<p>We explore how language models can be used for prototyping and how they allow us to explore the alien minds of generative AIs. We also discuss how technology is largely about taking what already exists in the universe and finding ways to apply it for human purposes. We consider the question of whether there will ever be an end to invention and Stephen introduces the concept of computational irreducibility, which explains that even when you know the rules of a system you can't necessarily know what it will do without just following the rules and seeing what happens. We examine how machine learning is a way of finding a program that will satisfy a technological use case and discuss the challenge of defining use cases.</p>]]>

<h5 id="00000digitizingthefoodsupplychain">(0:00:00) - Digitizing the Food Supply Chain</h5>
<p>Vikas Gupta, the CTO of Choco, is focused on bringing the fragmented hospitality industry to the digital space, connecting suppliers with restaurants and institutions to place orders. Vikas explains the current order process of SMS, WhatsApp, voicemail, and email and how Choco is using data to automate the process for chefs so they can focus on cooking. He also touches on how front-of-the-house processes are already digitized, but back-of-the-house processes still need to be further developed to reduce food waste and create sustainability in the food supply chain.</p>
<h5 id="00913fromprogrammingtofoodsustainability">(0:09:13) - From Programming to Food Sustainability</h5>
<p>Vikas Gupta shares his journey in tech from his early days learning to code in Pascal, his experience in Silicon Valley, and the journey that ultimately led his to joining . He recounts his experience programming games and designing board games, as well as the challenges of programming in mobile environments. Vikas also shares why he left Silicon Valley to join Dropbox and eventually , and the drive to make a positive change in the world with the food sustainability space.</p>
<h5 id="01819techstackanddecisionmakingprocess">(0:18:19) - Tech Stack and Decision-Making Process</h5>
<p>We explore the stack and decisions behind Choco. We discuss why they chose their tech stack (AWS serverless architecture with NodeJS, React) And why he regrets not using cross platform development earlier. (They are migrating to Flutter now). We also discuss the pros and cons of monoliths versus microservices and why Flutter was the right decision for them. Vikas shares the importance of collaboration between web engineers and native engineers in order to create a platform that allows teams to move quickly and build effectively.</p>
<h5 id="02732balancingproductandplatforminitiatives">(0:27:32) - Balancing Product and Platform Initiatives</h5>
<p>We discuss how to balance the needs of the user, the time available, and the people available when making technology decisions. We explore how leaders can create an environment conducive to having conversations around technology decisions, and how to define a timeline for a transition to a new technology. We also discuss the idea of creating Excellence Days and using 80-20 to allow engineers to focus on technical topics and platform improvements. Finally, we talk about using coloured flags - so you know when the house is on fire and you need to drop everything and fix it.</p>
<h5 id="03618balancingtechnologyandproductleadership">(0:36:18) - Balancing Technology and Product Leadership</h5>
<p>We explore the importance of quantifying the value of legacy code and how to present that data to leadership. We approach the challenge of overhauling an entire architecture and how to align leadership on delivering business value. We discuss the process of creating a roadmap and coordinating between product, sales, and engineering teams - plus how to be flexible while maintaining focus. Finally, we look at the importance of eye-level collaboration to challenge each other in order to achieve the best outcome.</p>]]>

In the past decade, they have made 45 million Raspberry Pis while improving on the original’s performance 40X!!! 
Learn top tips about building great hardware (it is called hard for a reason) and why you need 10 domain experts, $1 million dollars, and a risk appetite to ⚙️ power the creations of millions of people. 

 Listen to find out:
- Why technical leaders with multiple demands on their time should stay away from the code 👩‍💻 
- Why do they no longer manufacture hardware in the Far East 🌏
- What will outdated semi-conductor manufacturing facilities 🏭 be used for?
- How they are handling the supply chain disruptions 🚢 and the conflict in Eastern Europe (e.g. bot scalping, rerouting, prioritization).

P.S.  If you like gambling - try the semi-conductor industry.</description>

      <description>Taylor Otwell, CEO, and  Creator of Laravel (a popular PHP framework) - gives tips on how to commercialize an open-source by sharing his winning recipe of a lean team, great UX/UI, time management, product management, and of course, commercial products. He also gives insight into the use of the various frameworks for full-stack engineering (SPOILER ALERT: Full-stack bootcamps should be teaching more than Javascript). 

Listen to find out::

- How to get to 6M$ ARR starting with an open-source project (HINT: It’s not through sponsored repositories)
- Why to build a SaaS with a single full-stack engineer 🦸 you need to abandon Javascript 
- Why it's better to follow product vision 🧭 and ROI when building features rather than detractors' requests.
- What goes on behind the scenes 🛠️ at Laravel (product management, team structure, async etc.)

      <description>David Heinemeier Hansson, CTO  of Basecamp and Hey and creator of Ruby-on-Rails💎 blows us away yet again in this thought-provoking podcast about bootstrapping, scaling, remote work, and of course Ruby on Rails.

Learn insights into technical leadership from someone who has been leading a remote team since 2004 (hint: You are doing Slack and Zoom wrong),  believes in async work, and loves the fact that his company doesn’t have an office 🏢. Plus, after 20 years of creating multi-million dollar SaaS products -  he just made his first middle management hire!! 🤯
Listen to find out:

- Product discovery: Why he rather ships a product instead of doing discovery with Figma prototypes. There is no stronger confirmation than a user that pays for your product
- Why they capped Basecamps size to 60 for a long time 🧑‍💼and discontinued a lot of products to fully focus
- How he would bootstrap a startup in  2022 🚀 (e.g. SaaS, remote, small team, nodecode vs. handcrafted software).
- Why he doesn’t work on Ruby on Rails👨‍💻 full time and why he thinks it’s good for the framework that it’s not commercial at all
- How Rails 7 brings back developer productivity + pushes UX to the next level WITHOUT a lot of Javascript (No SPA inside!) with Hotwire
+ His favorite productivity tip? He cut down Twitter by 97%

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sastrify.com/alphalist">Sastrify</a></strong>
Thanks a lot to my friends at Sastrify for sponsoring this episode.
A lot of CTOs I know are responsible for procurement of software as a service tools by accident and never have the time and energy to work on optimizing their costs.
For example: at my company OMR, we have a lot of tools… Gsuite, Adobe creative cloud, Newrelic and many more.
Sastrify helps companies like ours to optimize those costs &amp;  negotiate with suppliers of such software.
In our case they helped us to save around 20.000€ per year, which is a lot if you look at our company size of around 150 people.
It is a simple and hassle-free process we went through and I can just recommend anyone listening to do the same. They actually promise to save more money than they cost.</p>
<p>They are already working with a lot of alphalist members such as Runstatic, Westwing and Emma.</p>
<p>They are giving a 50% discount for the first 3 months to all podcast listeners so go to  <a href="http://www.sastrify.com/alphalist">www.sastrify.com/alphalist</a> to get started today</p>

This episode is again kindly supported by Fastly, the biggest challenger in the CDN market and a solution I personally use.
Fastly is pushing ahead the technical boundaries and is from my personal perspective the best solution on the market. Fastly is one of the key drivers of the "edge cloud trend".</p>
<p>Well-known customers of Fastly are Shopify, The New York Times, Reddit, Github and many many more.</p>

Thanks a lot to my friends at Sastrify for sponsoring this episode.
A lot of CTOs I know are responsible for procurement of software as a service tools by accident and never have the time and energy to work on optimizing their costs.
For example: at my company OMR, we have a lot of tools… Gsuite, Adobe creative cloud, Newrelic and many more.
Sastrify helps companies like ours to optimize those costs &amp;  negotiate with suppliers of such software.
In our case they helped us to save around 20.000€ per year, which is a lot if you look at our company size of around 150 people.
It is a simple and hassle-free process we went through and I can just recommend anyone listening to do the same. They actually promise to save more money than they cost.</p>
<p>They are already working with a lot of alphalist members such as Runstatic, Westwing and Emma.</p>
<p>They are giving a 50% discount for the first 3 months to all podcast listeners so go to  <a href="http://www.sastrify.com/alphalist">www.sastrify.com/alphalist</a> to get started today</p>]]>

- The difference between servant-leadership and situational leadership and when to use what
     + A message to those who think parenthood :children_crossing:might take away from their career


If you loved his straight-talking ReadMe about himself, you will also like this thought-provoking episode on leadership, management, and of course remote work from someone who manages a completely remote team of 560, in a company of 1300+</description>

I had the chance to talk to John Romero, the inventor of DOOM, Wolfenstein and Commander Keen and founder of id Software about

* Developing games in the early 90s and how they developed DOOM in a crazy small team
* Developing games in 2021 and how it’s still possible to develop games with only a single person team
* The crazy amounts of money they made with DOOM 🤑💶🤑
* The crazy amounts of energy drinks they consumed
* Why not he would not start developing a game engine again


Thanks a lot John! Was really fun talking to you.</description>

      <description>Today with me in the Podcast is Tim O'Reilly, the Founder &amp; CEO of O'Reilly Media and boy, his 1,5 million 
twitter followers are there for a reason!

People call him "the Oracle of the Silicon Valley", he came up with the term "Web 2.0" - This man is crazy a wizard!

We spoke about:
* Writing as superpower! How it helps you to structure your thoughts.
* How he started OSCON and great nerdy 90s
* The big tectonic "Platform changes" and how the giants use "Algorithmic Rents" to silently put more money
into their pockets
* The wrong incentives and optimization functions of our economy and how to change it  
* How we are part of "the machine" and "the machine" needs us to decide what is good ("ham") 
and what is bad ("spam")

Brilliant thoughts! Thank you so much Tim!</description>

      <description>This time I had Olivier Bonnet, the CTO of BlaBlaCar in the podcast. 
BlaBlaCar is the carpooling company: They own the market. 
They are active in 22 Countries, have 100M+ Users and acquired 12 other carpooling  companies.
Olivier, the CTO, joined me to talk about:

* How his time at  Apple taught him to think long term
* 100 million users, 12 acquisitions: The strategy behind BlaCar
* The complexity of route planning 🌐
* How writing 🖊️ helps people at Bla to structure their thoughts: They are writing press releases for new features, Amazon style.
* You build it, you run it! How technology decision discipline works at BlaCar

Was a great ride with you, Olivier! We both turned out to be a bit more Bla ;-) in this episode than we initially thought.</description>

      <description>In this episode I talk to Jason Warner, Github CTO aka "the PaaS Guru". He used to work for Heroku before and 
explained what he's planning and executing at Github and how Github uses it's massive amount of data to go away 
from pure repo-hosting.

Topics that stand out:
* How microsoft is working out quite well for them (Careful: contains Steve Balmer rants)
* How Github will revolutionize the Platform as a Service world (PaaS)
* His thoughts about developer productivity and the broken idea of measuring an individual engineers performance 📈📈📈
* How he breaks down the organization strategy from into mission, vision, priorities, goals, and tasks to get everyone aligned

He also reveals his past as 🏋️ Fitness Guru, having written multiple fitness books and what happened when a colleague found that out...</description>

      <description>This time I'm talking to an absolute legend: Mitchell Hashimoto, the CTO of HashiCorp the company behind a series
of brilliant open source products (Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Vagrant) that are highly successfully both business wise and community wise.
I would even argue that HashiCorp is the only company that manages to do that.

We talk about:
* The path from 7 to 1000+ employees in the last 10 years 📈📈📈
* How Mitch is still able to be a very active github user and contribute a lot of code while growing a big enterprise company to IPO
* How to build successful open source projects
* Where to draw the line in open core businesses
* How to be able to prevent cloud providers from sucking your blood 🧛</description>

* What TomTom does these days and the technical challenges in location based services &amp; mapping these days
* How to establish tech culture and open source in a large enterprise
* The challenges of the automotive industry in a software world 🚗
* 📈 The importances of the accelerate KPIs in modern engineering orgs and how to move fast 📈

      <description>This time, I have a very technical podcast on Webassembly and the new kid on the block: the Edge Cloud 
with Fastly's CTO Tyler McMullen, one of the leading CDNs and edge cloud companies out there.

* The future of distributed computation: From Serverless to ☁️ Cloudless ☁️
* Webassembly as the new industry standard intermediate representation/micro container. 
And guess what? Your browser most likely already supports it!
* How a CDN works internally and the challenges of building it
* How he manages to still be a coding geek in 💰💰💰 10BN company

This podcast was actually recorded shortly before Covid - if you wonder how we could meet up in Berlin ;-)</description>

      <description>This time I had Jean Michel Lemieux or short JML, the CTO of 🛒 Shopify 🛒 in the podcast.
Craziest fact: He took the time two days before black Friday 💥. In the podcast he also told me why.

We spoke about:
* His fight against crazy 👟 sneaker - sniping - bots and how Shopify keeps people
in line happy with games
* What it takes to run the largest Ruby on Rails (majestic ;-)) monolith on the planet
* Why he does not believe in microservice architecture but still runs some services
* How he keeps his 2000 engineer army 🪖 aligned
* Why he still sells stuff for kids online through his own platform

It was crazy fun, even if I missed the swearing after David Heinemeier Hansson took that route.</description>

      <itunes:title>#14 - David Heinemeier Hansson // CTO Basecamp, inventor of Ruby on Rails, bestselling author &amp; Race driver</itunes:title>
      <description>In this episode I am thrilled to welcome David Heinemeier Hansson, CTO of Basecamp, inventor of Ruby on Rails, founder of Hey.com, book author of books like "Remote" or "It does not have to be crazy at work".

Some topics we touched:
* How David Discovered the magic of Ruby 💎
* How he finds moments of deep flow in programming and racing
* Why Smartwatches are a gift from hell⌚
* Why the 60 hour work week is a stupid lie
* Why he would immediately quit if he was hired as CTO of Zalando 👚
* How they successfully manage Basecamp, and why "the Spotify Model" is a myth

☠️ Strong language, be careful ☠️
And: You might notice that I had to laugh at least 60% of the time. Thanks David for your time and this great episode.</description>

      <description>Podcast time! This time I have the chance to talk to the judo brown belt owning CTO of the scooter&amp; mobility startup TIER mobility Matthias Laug.
Before TIER he co-founded Lieferando and boy, he's a nice guest to talk to.

We spoke about:
* Why he puts people over tech
* What they use to run their large IoT stack
* His vision of Scooters talking to each other in a huge mesh
* Why he after founding Lieferando and having a large exit still started at Thoughtworks
* When to not do backflips even if you perfected doing them

He also briefly mentions Eric Bowman, Martin Fowler and Pat Kua who have one thing in common: I did not interview them for the alphalist podcast - Would be happy to chat with you guys too! :)</description>

      <description>This time I am talking to my friend Johannes Schaback, CTO of Home24, who is also originally a co-founder of alphalist and 
one of the brightest minds in the German engineering, tech and business-tech scene.
We are talking about his journey through the AI and data world, the Do's and Don'ts and the real world, no bullshit application of machine learning.

We are Tackle:
* Data is the new oil - wrong or right?
* The machine learning models @ Home24
* How ML-infrastructure evolved in the last decade
* The necessity to spend more time in the problem space before entering the solution space

We talk about mentorship and great people he learned from (*ping* Marc Appelhoff, Brigitte Wittekind,  Christian Weiss, Philipp Kreibohm ;-)).
Thanks a lot Johannes and looking forward to track your successes at Home24, your career and investments.</description>

      <description>Wow, my guest this time is able to see through the matrix 💊:
It's Marty Cagan, inventor of product discovery and best selling author of the book "INSPIRED", 
one of the partners of the Silicon Valley Product Group and potentially the 
biggest eye opener for 90% of the delivery organizations out there: We are most likely doing our job wrong!

He saw so much different product and delivery orgs from Apple to Google to Spotify and talks about
his learnings:

* How agile is interpreted wrong in 90% of the companies
* How modern organizations waste their resources
* How to tackle product discovery and user testing
* Autonomy vs. Empowerment

Thanks Marty, it's been a blast!</description>

      <description>This time, I have the honor to talk to Peter Grosskopf, CTO of Börse Stuttgart digital exchange and former CTO of Solarisbank.
He's an amazing guy for philosophical discussions around finance, tech and we share one love that is no longer as cool as it was in the 00's: Ruby on rails!

This time we discuss:
* How he made regulations his hobby 👓 and wants developers to feel like working for Spotify or Soundcloud even with regulations in place
* The do's and don'ts in Fintech
* Why he rather picks mature stacks (aka Postgres and Ruby on rails) against the "new kids on the block"
* How he thinks about new things tech like Apache Kafka

Thanks again for being my guest, it was a lot of fun.</description>

* How he made regulations his hobby 👓 and wants developers to feel like working for Spotify or Soundcloud even with regulations in place
* The do's and don'ts in Fintech
* Why he rather picks mature stacks (aka Postgres and Ruby on rails) against the "new kids on the block"
* How he thinks about new things tech like Apache Kafka

Thanks again for being my guest, it was a lot of fun.</itunes:summary>

      <description>I had the chance to interview Sergei Anikin about how to scale a SaaS product. Sergei Anikin comes with vast experience in “large scale tech” as he was with Skype when it was sold 3 times (eBay, Private Equity, Microsoft) and is CTO at 90-million funded pipedrive (CRM SaaS) now.
Laser sharp focus on the essential features
“Scaling problems are good problems to have”
Microservices vs. Monoliths
Team structure at scale: Missions and tribes (https://medium.com/pipedrive-engineering/scaling-pipedrive-engineering-from-teams-to-tribes-8f14fd92df8c)
How they do M&amp;A and post merger integration
It was an honor to talk to Sergei Anikin and see him joining alphalist as a new member too.
Looking forward to your comments, feedback and guest proposals.</description>

      <itunes:title>Mikko Hyppönen // F-Secure</itunes:title>
      <description>I had to deal with cybersecurity topics recently; I've even been in touch with the FBI 👮. On this occasion I invited a brilliant guest for the alphalist Podcast: It’s Mikko Hyppönen, a computer security specialist and scientific director at the security company F-Secure.
He spent half of his life hacking and chasing hackers and he knows how to talk about it: I saw at least 3 TED Talks by him and yes, they are very entertaining and helpful.

Key topics in the Podcast are:
- The recent twitter hack and the stupidness of the hackers
- How cybersecurity evolved and became a required skill for companies and countries
- His recommendations for modern mid sized companies around Cybersecurity (Where to start with processes, recruiting, tools, budgets)
- What to do if you’ve been compromised

You won’t regret that you've listened :-)</description>

      <description>I am thrilled to announce this weeks podcast guest: Prof. Sebastian Thrun 
Brief overview: He is a Stanford professor, founder of Google X, built the first self driving car, won the Darpa-Award for it, started the online-academy Udacity and is now building autonomous planes at Kitty Hawk. Wow. 
Can you tell why I highly admire him and how excited I was when I won him for my podcast? 
We talked about the car nation in Germany, how competitive we are in the AI and software world, Stanford vs. TU-Munich, why Sebastian is striving for a brain-computer interface, why he has built the leading online university Udacity and how to tackle machine learning as a modern CTO.
He also explains why he eventually comes up with a Bluetooth-connected Smart-Bra next.</description>
