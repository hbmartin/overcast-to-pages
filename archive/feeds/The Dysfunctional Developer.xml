    <description>"The Dysfunctional Developer" is a fresh take on tech from the voices of JS Party, bringing a no-nonsense perspective to web development conversations. From AI's impact on junior developers to practical debugging skills, the show cuts through industry hype to deliver authentic discussions that represent the average developer's experience. This successor to JS Party features meaningful conversations with industry voices while maintaining a down-to-earth, real-world approach to tech.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Amy, KBall, and Nick chat about how the current economy is shaking up tech careers and what you can do to stay resilient. They get into why it’s smart to keep learning, share your work publicly, and stay connected—especially when things feel uncertain. They also talk about the weird mix of excitement and dread around AI, the rise of LLMs, and how those tools can actually make you more productive if you use them right. Plus, they share what they’re learning right now, swap thoughts on new frameworks, and give some real talk on job hunting and staying steady in a rocky market.</p><p><strong>Don't agree with me prompt</strong></p>Avoid simply agreeing with my points or taking my conclusions at face value. I want a real intellectual challenge, not just affirmation. Whenever I propose an idea, do this:<p>- Question my assumptions. What am I treating as true that might be questionable? <br>- Offer a skeptic's viewpoint. What objections would a critical, well-informed voice raise? <br>- Check my reasoning. Are there flaws or leaps in logic I've overlooked?<br>- Suggest alternative angles. How else might the idea be viewed, interpreted, or challenged?<br>- Focus on accuracy over agreement. If my argument is weak or wrong, correct me plainly and show me how. <br>- Stay constructive but rigorous. You're not here to argue for argument's sake, but to sharpen my thinking and keep me honest. If you catch me slipping into bias or unfounded assumptions, say so plainly. Let's refine both our conclusions and the way we reach them.</p><p><br><strong>Creators &amp; Guests</strong>
