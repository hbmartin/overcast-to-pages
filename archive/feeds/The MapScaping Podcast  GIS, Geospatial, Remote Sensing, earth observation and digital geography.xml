                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Telematics Data is Reshaping Our Understanding of Road Networks</p>
<p>In this episode MIT Professor Hari Balakrishnan explains how Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) is transforming traditional road network analysis by layering dynamic behavioural data onto static map geometries. </p>
<p>Telematics data creates "living maps" that go beyond traditional road geometry and attributes. By collecting movement data from 45 million users through phones and IoT devices, CMT has developed sophisticated models that can:</p>
<p>- Generate dynamic risk maps showing crash probability for every road segment globally
- Detect infrastructure issues that aren't visible in traditional mapping (like poorly placed bus stops)
- Validate and correct map attributes like speed limits and lane connectivity
- Differentiate between overpasses and intersections using movement patterns
- Create contextual understanding of road segments based on actual usage patterns</p>
<p>Particularly interesting for GIS professionals is CMT's approach to data fusion, combining traditional map geometry with temporal movement data to create predictive models. This has practical applications from infrastructure planning to autonomous vehicle navigation, where understanding the cultural context of road usage proves as important as precise geometry.</p>
<p>The episode challenges traditional static approaches to road network mapping, suggesting that the future lies in dynamic, behavior-informed spatial data models that can adapt to changing conditions and usage patterns.</p>
<p>For anyone working with transportation networks or smart city initiatives, this episode provides valuable insights into how movement data is changing our understanding of road infrastructure and spatial behaviour.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I’m thrilled to welcome back Ariel Seidman, founder of HiveMapper. Ariel was my very first podcast guest back in 2019, and HiveMapper has come a long way since then!</p>
<p>We explore how HiveMapper has evolved from a drone-based mapping system to a cutting-edge platform collecting street-level data at a global scale. Ariel shares the challenges of scaling large-scale mapping efforts, the pivot to building their own hardware, and the role of blockchain-based incentives in driving adoption.</p>
<p>Here are just a few topics we cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why HiveMapper shifted focus from drones to street-level mapping.</li>
<li>The power of combining hardware and software to solve mapping challenges.</li>
<li>How HiveMapper has already mapped 28% of the global road network.</li>
<li>The revolutionary edge computing and data filtering techniques driving efficiency.</li>
<li>What it takes to compete with industry giants like Google Maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you're fascinated by the intersection of geospatial technology and innovation or looking for insights into scaling impactful startups, this episode is packed with value.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I welcome Jason Gilman, a Principal Software Engineer at Element 84, to explore the exciting world of natural language geocoding.</p>
<p>Key Topics Discussed:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Introduction to Natural Language Geocoding:</p>
<ul><li>Jason explains the concept of natural language geocoding and its significance in converting textual descriptions of locations into precise geographical data. This involves using large language models to interpret a user's natural language input, such as "the coast of Florida south of Miami," and transform it into an accurate polygon that represents that specific area on a map. This process automates and simplifies how users interact with geospatial data, making it more accessible and user-friendly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Evolution of AI and ML in Geospatial Work:</p>
<ul><li>Over the last six months, Jason has shifted focus to AI and machine learning, leveraging large language models to enhance geospatial data processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges and Solutions:</p>
<ul><li>Jason discusses the challenges of interpreting natural language descriptions and the solutions they've implemented, such as using JSON schemas and OpenStreetMap data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications and Use Cases:</p>
<ul><li>From finding specific datasets to processing geographical queries, the applications of natural language geocoding are vast. Jason shares some real-world examples and potential future uses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future of Geospatial AIML:</p>
<ul><li>Jason touches on the broader implications of geospatial AI and ML, including the potential for natural language geoprocessing and its impact on scientific research and everyday applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><p>Interesting Insights:</p>
<ul><li>The use of large language models can simplify complex geospatial queries, making advanced geospatial analysis accessible to non-experts.</li>
<li>Integration of AI and machine learning with traditional geospatial tools opens new avenues for research and application, from environmental monitoring to urban planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes:</p>
<ul><li>"Natural language geocoding is about turning a user's textual description of a place on Earth into a precise polygon."</li>
<li>"The combination of vision models and large language models allows us to automate complex tasks that previously required manual effort."</li>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode, I welcome Jason Gilman, a Principal Software Engineer at Element 84, to explore the exciting world of natural language geocoding.
Key Topics Discussed:

Introduction to Natural Language Geocoding:
Jason explains the concept of natural language geocoding and its significance in converting textual descriptions of locations into precise geographical data. This involves using large language models to interpret a user's natural language input, such as "the coast of Florida south of Miami," and transform it into an accurate polygon that represents that specific area on a map. This process automates and simplifies how users interact with geospatial data, making it more accessible and user-friendly.


The Evolution of AI and ML in Geospatial Work:
Over the last six months, Jason has shifted focus to AI and machine learning, leveraging large language models to enhance geospatial data processing.


Challenges and Solutions:
Jason discusses the challenges of interpreting natural language descriptions and the solutions they've implemented, such as using JSON schemas and OpenStreetMap data.


Applications and Use Cases:
From finding specific datasets to processing geographical queries, the applications of natural language geocoding are vast. Jason shares some real-world examples and potential future uses.


Future of Geospatial AIML:
Jason touches on the broader implications of geospatial AI and ML, including the potential for natural language geoprocessing and its impact on scientific research and everyday applications.

Interesting Insights:
The use of large language models can simplify complex geospatial queries, making advanced geospatial analysis accessible to non-experts.
Integration of AI and machine learning with traditional geospatial tools opens new avenues for research and application, from environmental monitoring to urban planning.
Quotes:
"Natural language geocoding is about turning a user's textual description of a place on Earth into a precise polygon."
"The combination of vision models and large language models allows us to automate complex tasks that previously required manual effort."

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast episode is all about semantic search and using embeddings to analyse text and social media data.</p>
<p>Dominik Weckmüller, a researcher at the Technical University of Dresden, talks about his PhD research, where he looks at how to analyze text with geographic references. </p>
<p>He explains hyperloglog and embeddings, showing how these methods capture the meaning of text and can be used to search big databases without knowing the topics beforehand.</p>
<p>Here are the main points discussed:</p>
<ol><li> Intro to Semantic Search and Hyperloglog: Looking at social media data by counting different users talking about specific topics in parks, while keeping privacy in mind.</li>
<li> Embeddings and Deep Learning Models: Turning text into numerical vectors (embeddings) to understand its meaning, allowing for advanced searches.</li>
<li> Application Examples: Using embeddings to search for things like emotions or activities in parks without needing predefined keywords.</li>
<li> Creating and Using Embeddings: Tools like transformers.js let you make embeddings on your computer, making it easy to analyze text.</li>
<li> Challenges and Innovations: Talking about how to explain the models, deal with long texts, and keep data private when using embeddings.</li>
<li> Future Directions: The potential for using embeddings with different media (like images and videos) and languages, plus the ongoing research in this fast-moving field.</li>

<p>Sometimes It feels like we need to learn a whole new vocabulary and if you have been doing #geo for a while you might be wondering how much of this is actually going to impact me. What bits of this are the ones that I need to know about? </p>
<p>I don’t think that anyone is going to be talking about cloud native in 10 years, in the same way, no one talks about digital cartography or computer analysis because where else would you do your cartography? And how else would you do your analysis? </p>
<p>Maybe the names won’t be as important but the concepts will and while this episode is focused on Geoparquet it does so within the context of cloud-native geospatial - and this concept is not going away! </p>

<p>You guessed, today's podcast is all about indoor mapping, why it's hard, what are the use cases driving it, what the state of the art looks like today and what we can expect in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Key points discussed include:</p>
<p>1. **The Challenge of Indoor Mapping**: Unlike outdoor mapping, indoor environments are complex due to the density of objects and frequent changes. Moreover, indoor spaces are mostly private property, making it difficult to collect data comprehensively.</p>
<p>2. **Importance of Indoor Maps**: Despite the challenges, the need for indoor maps is growing. Applications range from wayfinding in malls and airports to optimizing logistics in warehouses and creating better guest experiences in various venues.</p>
<p>3. **Mappedins's Approach**: enabling non-experts to create and maintain indoor maps. Their tools are designed for everyday users, allowing them to update maps as easily as they would a document in Google Docs.</p>
<p>4. **Technological Advances**: While technologies like LiDAR and digital twins offer detailed 3D models, are they really practical? .</p>
<p>5. **Indoor Positioning**: Accurate indoor positioning is crucial for the success of indoor maps, similar to how GPS revolutionized outdoor mapping. However, this remains a challenging area due to signal interference and the complexity of indoor spaces.</p>
<p>6. **Future Outlook**:  Digital indoor maps become as ubiquitous as Wi-Fi, providing essential data for various applications and improving overall user experience ... but we are not there yet!</p>

<p>Here are the key tools mentioned:</p>
<p>1. **Kobo Toolbox**: An open-source tool used for data collection in humanitarian contexts. Kobo Toolbox allows for both quantitative and qualitative data collection and is operational offline, which is crucial in areas with limited internet connectivity. It supports geospatial data collection and can be used for needs assessments in settings like refugee camps.</p>
<p>2. **ODK Collect**: Similar to Kobo Toolbox, ODK Collect is an open-source mobile application used for field data collection. It is widely used in humanitarian efforts for its ease of use and the capability to work offline.</p>
<p>3. **QGIS**: A free and open-source geographic information system used for viewing, editing, and analyzing geospatial data. Hugo notes that QGIS is core for mapping and data analysis in humanitarian operations.</p>
<p>4. **Tableau and Power BI**: Business intelligence tools mentioned for their use in analyzing and visualizing data. These tools help in making data-driven decisions during humanitarian operations.</p>
<p>5. **Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)**: An open platform for sharing data across crises and organizations, which helps in avoiding duplication of efforts and enhances coordination among humanitarian actors.</p>
<p>6. **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)**: Provides crowdsourced geospatial data which is extremely valuable in humanitarian settings for its accuracy and timeliness.</p>
<p>7. **Esri’s Living Atlas and other Esri tools**: While not open-source, Esri’s tools are sometimes used for their comprehensive geospatial data, particularly in natural disaster contexts like earthquakes.</p>
<p>8. **Humanitarian Spatial Data Center**: Managed by IMAP, this tool aggregates and processes data, providing access to data, analytics, and visualization tools all in one place. It has been particularly successful in deployments like Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Some of the key topics in this episode </p>
<p>1.Our Geospatial Skills and Marketability: There's a realization that while our traditional geospatial skills are valuable, they might not always be marketed effectively to match the broader IT and data analysis job markets. We discuss the benefit of framing our skills in terms that are more widely recognized outside the niche of geospatial technology, such as data science or IT.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2.The Spatial Discount: We explore the concept of the spatial discount, which refers to the observation that geospatial professionals might face a disparity in compensation compared to their counterparts in more generalized IT roles, despite having highly transferable and valuable data manipulation skills.</p>
<p>3. Skill Development and Adaptation: The importance of continually developing skills that are not only advanced within the geospatial domain but also marketable across various sectors is emphasized. Learning and mastering technologies that have broad applications, such as SQL for spatial data manipulation, can enhance our versatility and marketability.</p>
<p>4. Communication and Marketing Skills: Our ability to effectively communicate and market our skills is highlighted as crucial for career advancement. We are encouraged to adopt the language and terminology that resonate with broader industries and potential employers, moving beyond the jargon of the geospatial field.</p>
<p>5. Finding Value in Our Geospatial Work: The discussion also touches on the importance of identifying and articulating the real-world value of our geospatial work. We should focus on how our skills can solve practical problems and address the needs of businesses and organizations, rather than solely on the technical complexity of our tasks.</p>
<p>6. Professional Development: Lastly, the conversation advocates for a proactive approach to our professional development, suggesting that we should seek out opportunities to learn new skills and technologies that align with market demands and personal interests.</p>
<p>These points collectively suggest a strategy for us, as geospatial professionals, to enhance our career prospects: by broadening our skill sets, effectively marketing our capabilities, and aligning our work with the needs and language of the wider IT and data analysis fields.</p>

Learning and mastering technologies that have broad applications, such as SQL for spatial data manipulation, can enhance our versatility and marketability.
4. Communication and Marketing Skills: Our ability to effectively communicate and market our skills is highlighted as crucial for career advancement. We are encouraged to adopt the language and terminology that resonate with broader industries and potential employers, moving beyond the jargon of the geospatial field.
5. Finding Value in Our Geospatial Work: The discussion also touches on the importance of identifying and articulating the real-world value of our geospatial work. We should focus on how our skills can solve practical problems and address the needs of businesses and organizations, rather than solely on the technical complexity of our tasks.
6. Professional Development: Lastly, the conversation advocates for a proactive approach to our professional development, suggesting that we should seek out opportunities to learn new skills and technologies that align with market demands and personal interests.
These points collectively suggest a strategy for us, as geospatial professionals, to enhance our career prospects: by broadening our skill sets, effectively marketing our capabilities, and aligning our work with the needs and language of the wider IT and data analysis fields.

<p>Well my guest Will Cadell, the CEO of SparkGeo describes modern geospatial as the intersection of the cloud, smart space, open source data/standards, AI and smart devices - that's modern geospatial </p>
<p>And as you will hear during the discussion it's important to understand the difference between modernisation and innovation when we think about moving people from where they are now to where they want to be with regards to their geospatial capabilities. </p>
<p>You might be wondering - what does any of this have to do with me? I just want to make better things, I just want to help people use all this awesome geospatial stuff … </p>
<p>but you don’t get to do that without first understanding what “better” looks like for them - what is their version of awesome geo stuff … and that is why you should listen to this episode! </p>

Imaging “Just about everywhere on earth just about every day – Making change visible, accessible, and actionable”
… and the hope of this episode is to help you understand how they do that – along the way
you will hear about their two constellations and how they work together
Learn the difference between ghost ships and dark ships and find out that there are very few ground control points in the ocean and why that matters
Find out what this means for GIS and permit enforcement.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is a story about wide-angle imaging for fire mapping and maritime search but it's also a story about changing the culture and getting people to trust a new way of doing things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My guest today is Alison Harrod - mission success manager at a start-up called Overwatch imaging </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whenever I work with a company like Overwatch Imaging it is hard to know which story to tell, we could just as easily have made an episode about AI and object detection or about smart sensors because they do those things too. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The decision depends on the guest and their background so after meeting Alison we decided to make this episode for you and try to give you a broad overview of what wide-angle imaging is and how it's used in the context of fire mapping and maritime search.</p>
<p>...but It's one thing to have a technology and it is another thing entirely to get people to use it … as you will hear fire mapping is not “a move fast and break things kind of situation”</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Embracing Open-Source Geospatial Technology is easy as an individual but what if you want your organization to use FOSS4G</p>
<p>How do you get strategic buy-in?</p>
<p>It turns out that the software does not sell itself and that even in the age of AI we still have to convince a human if we want organizational change to to happen. </p>
<p>I think the temptation is to say hey look at this long list of specifications and notice how FOSS4G is often better or equal to the close source equivalent. </p>
<p>Or hey look at the price tag … it costs nothing which is way cheaper than this other thing which costs more than nothing.</p>
<p>While this might be all the argumentation you need in some cases … in general, making change happen is hard,  and it's going to require more than that. </p>
<p>That's why I have invited <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddbarr/'>Todd Barr </a>back on the podcast to walk us through what it takes to get an organization to Embrace Open-Source Geospatial Technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are a few of the key points</p>
<ul><li style="font-weight:400;">Getting buy-in for open-source software and addressing concerns about security and IP protection</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Perspectives of External and internal stakeholders on open-source Software</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Importance of collaboration, empathy, and understanding in decision-making and stakeholder management</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Challenges of implementing open source technology in a corporate environment</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Benefits of using open source solutions, such as faster analysis, increased stability, and flexibility for innovation</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Accessibility and support in open source communities, including direct interaction with developers and availability of external consultants</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Customization and development work required for creating vertical solutions with open-source components</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Finding skilled developers and training them in geospatial technology</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Cost-saving advantages of open source technology in cloud computing</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Leading arguments for implementing open source software: cost savings and freedom to modify and customize</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">Advocacy for supporting and integrating with the open source community.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>The last time Todd was on the podcast we talked about Leadership and Mentorship in the Geospatial community</p>

<p>100 billion is a very large number, let's say that I gave you a spreadsheet with 100 billion rows in it, each row consisted of five columns Latitude, Longitude, Device ID, A Timestamp, and a column telling the name of the data provider</p>
<p>What would you do with that? </p>
<p>How would you clean it? Make sense of it? Extract value from it? What would people use it for? And how would you do this in a way that could be systematized?</p>
<p><a href='https://foursquare.com/'>FourSquare</a> does this every day with the help of something they call a movement engine.</p>
<p>To help understand more about how they do this I have invited <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieldurkin/'>Gabriel Durkin the director of data science</a> on the podcast. This is the last in a series of episodes I have worked on together with FourSquare and I have to say it's been really enjoyable working with them. </p>

<p>But it is not enough to have a lot of data we also need data that is labeled</p>
<p>If we are looking for cars in images we need a lot of images of cars and we need to know which pixels are the car! </p>
<p>Of course, I am oversimplifying but I hope you get the idea, </p>
<p>Now imagine that you can automatically generate a large labeled data set of realistic images of cars based on the specifications of a specific sensor.</p>
<p>These data sets are often referred to as synthetic data or fake data and to help us understand more about this I have invited <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjandrews/'>Chris Andrews</a> from <a href='https://www.rendered.ai/'>Rendered AI</a> on the podcast.</p>

<p><a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/computer-vision-and-geoai/'>https://mapscaping.com/podcast/computer-vision-and-geoai/</a></p>
<p>In this episode, the discussion is aimed at an increased understanding of the differences between computer vision and the AI that is used in the Earth Observation world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Labels Matter</p>
<p><a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/labels-matter/'>https://mapscaping.com/podcast/labels-matter/</a></p>
<p>What it takes to create labeled training data manually. If you are new to the idea of labeled data sets this is a good place to start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fake Satellite Imagery</p>
<p><a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/fake-satellite-imagery/'>https://mapscaping.com/podcast/fake-satellite-imagery/</a></p>
<p>This is a good episode if you want to know more about Generative AI and Generative Adversarial Networks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, check out this website <a href='https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/'>https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/</a> to get an idea of where and how these Generative Adversarial Networks can be used. Look for a website called This City Does Not Exist  <a href='http://thiscitydoesnotexist.com/'>http://thiscitydoesnotexist.com/</a></p>

<p>Hub Ocean - as the name suggests is a hub for ocean data </p>
<p>Now we have talked about these kinds of data hubs before on the podcast - <a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/sentinel-hub/'>Sentinal Hub</a> - a data hub for earth observation data, <a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/the-planetary-computer/'>Microsoft Planetary Computer</a>, <a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/introducing-google-earth-engine/'>Google Earth Engine</a>, <a href='https://mapscaping.com/podcast/open-topography-infrastructure-for-topographic-data/'>Open Topography</a> is data but for topography data …. The concept is not new but also not easy to implement and if they work, these types of data hubs have a gravity to them that becomes more powerful over time.</p>
<p>One of the guiding concepts behind these data hubs seems to be the idea of FAIR data - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable data  </p>
<p>…. But its not enough to ensure that the data is fair I think we should also consider how we can make the results of our research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable data </p>
<p>If you are not already familiar with Cloud Optimised Geospatial formats it is worth checking out these two episodes. </p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is an interview with a senior data scientist from Hub Ocean, a platform that aims to unlock and unite ocean data.
Hub Ocean - as the name suggests is a hub for ocean data 
Now we have talked about these kinds of data hubs before on the podcast - Sentinal Hub - a data hub for earth observation data, Microsoft Planetary Computer, Google Earth Engine, Open Topography is data but for topography data …. The concept is not new but also not easy to implement and if they work, these types of data hubs have a gravity to them that becomes more powerful over time.
One of the guiding concepts behind these data hubs seems to be the idea of FAIR data - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable data  
…. But its not enough to ensure that the data is fair I think we should also consider how we can make the results of our research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable data 
If you are not already familiar with Cloud Optimised Geospatial formats it is worth checking out these two episodes.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[The promise of digital mapping is to provide a shared and real-time view of the state of the underlying system.










pg_eventserv is a free and open-source component that helps fulfill the promise of real-time event modeling and shared views in PostgreSQL.
By connecting to PostgreSQL and listening on specified channels, pg_eventserv captures database notifications and forwards them to web clients, enabling real-time updates and synchronization of data displayed on maps or other web interfaces.











pg_eventserv does one thing and one thing only: take events generated by the PostgreSQL NOTIFY command and passes the payload along to waiting WebSockets clients.

pg_eventserv is free and easy to install and you can find it here: https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_eventserv
What this means is that any client can watch for notifications and update as changes in the database happen.
Real-time data!
Here is a link to a Youtube video demonstration of pg_eventserv in action!
https://youtu.be/UakRtYmoWow 
I will let Paul Ramsey the creator of pg_eventserv explain all this in more detail in this episode. 
If you want to reach out to Paul the best place to do that is http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/

<p>Today the answer is likely to be via radios and a system of downlink sites or ground stations. As the satellites pass overhead or within “line of sight” data can be sent via radio from the satellite to the receiver on the ground. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to wait until the satellite can see the ground station, you can send your data to a geostationary satellite that can always see a ground station and let it send the data back to Earth. </p>
<p>Radios are tried and tested, they have been used for this purpose since the inception of satellite communication and radio waves can pass through Earth's atmosphere without significant loss!</p>
<p>But … the frequency spectrum for radio waves is strictly regulated, which can limit available channels for communication, and the bandwidth of radio frequencies is limited, which can reduce the volume of data transmission.</p>
<p>What about lasers? </p>
<p>You can send more data faster with a laser, you don’t need to worry about interfering with someone else part of the radio spectrum, and ground stations can be much smaller even human-portable! </p>
<p>But … lasers struggle with clouds and the technology is still relatively new</p>
<p>So what is the best way to communicate with satellites? Radio or Laser? The answer is … it depends ;) </p>

<p>You get the data a lot closer to the user and you don’t have to pay for the compute ;) </p>
<p>… this sounds great but as I found out during this conversation it's not as easy as it might seem! </p>
<p>There are a lot of trade-offs that need to be evaluated when moving data and analytics to the client.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the <a href='https://arrow.apache.org/'>Arrow data format</a> it might be worth checking out</p>
<p> </p>

Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead

<p> </p>
<p>You might think that this is exactly what we are doing in earth observation but there are a few important differences between computer vision and what some people refer to as GeoAI.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This week <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-inglada-08ab7313a/'>Jordi inglada</a> is going to help you understand what those differences are and why it's not always possible to use Computer vision techniques in the field of Remote Sensing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Listen out for these key points during the conversation!</p>
<ul><li>Why plausible or realistic data is not always a substitute for actual measurements, except when it is ;) </li>
<li>In computer vision we can learn from the data, in earth observation we know the physics</li>
<li>To do interesting work in data science you need to - Computer science, applied math, and domain expertise. You don’t need to be an expert in all three but you need to be interested in all three</li>
<li>Vectors in the machine learning world don’t necessarily have anything to do with points lines and polygons ;) </li>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images. 
 
You might think that this is exactly what we are doing in earth observation but there are a few important differences between computer vision and what some people refer to as GeoAI.
 
This week Jordi inglada is going to help you understand what those differences are and why it's not always possible to use Computer vision techniques in the field of Remote Sensing.
 
Listen out for these key points during the conversation!
Why plausible or realistic data is not always a substitute for actual measurements, except when it is ;) 
In computer vision we can learn from the data, in earth observation we know the physics
To do interesting work in data science you need to - Computer science, applied math, and domain expertise. You don’t need to be an expert in all three but you need to be interested in all three
Vectors in the machine learning world don’t necessarily have anything to do with points lines and polygons ;)

<p>This episode focuses on designing for privacy, how do we create value from location data without sacrificing personal privacy? </p>
<p>Well, you might start by adhering to the <a href='https://thenai.org/nais-enhanced-standards-for-precise-location-information-demonstrate-industry-leadership/'>Enhanced Standards For Precise Location Information </a>which means that information about sensitive places like churches, hospitals, military bases, and LGBTQ+ spaces isn't misused or sold. Plus, they protect our exact location from being shared with law enforcement or bounty hunters! </p>
<p>Yes, that's right bounty hunters! </p>
<p>You might also think about adding noise to the data, maybe you want to blur the time stamp and look at everything in aggregate?</p>
<p>It turns out the location data is not just classified as personal data but is actually classified as sensitive personal data in privacy law so if you are going to work with it you really need to understand the risks involved.</p>
<p>One of the really interesting ideas mentioned by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-hein-77302810/'>Elizabeth Hein VP of Compliance & Data Protection</a> was the idea of regulating Use, Harm, and Risk instead of sensitive data </p>

<p>PMtiles is a single file that you can access via HTTP range requests in the same way that you can access data within a Cloud Optimised Geotiff with the important difference that PMtiles can also contain vector data!</p>
<p>What this means is that you can create your own base map, and host it on something like Amazon S3 object storage at a fraction of the cost of other base map solutions! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>During this episode, you will hear Brandon, the founder, and creator of Protomaps, talk about scarcity, and well I have never really thought about base maps as being a scarce resource I can definitely see how a product like PMtiles could remove some of the barriers to entry for a lot of creativity in terms of base maps. </p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Protomaps is a serverless system for planet-scale maps, it's an umbrella project consisting of a few different components one of which is PMtiles.
PMtiles is “Cloud Optimise Geotiff” for web mapping, what this means is that you can build a base map and host it without the need for a server! 
PMtiles is a single file that you can access via HTTP range requests in the same way that you can access data within a Cloud Optimised Geotiff with the important difference that PMtiles can also contain vector data!
What this means is that you can create your own base map, and host it on something like Amazon S3 object storage at a fraction of the cost of other base map solutions! 
 
During this episode, you will hear Brandon, the founder, and creator of Protomaps, talk about scarcity, and well I have never really thought about base maps as being a scarce resource I can definitely see how a product like PMtiles could remove some of the barriers to entry for a lot of creativity in terms of base maps.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Storytelling with point clouds</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is not your typical point clouds episode! Today we are talking about how to use point clouds to tell a story. During this episode, you will hear <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-m%C3%BCller-8a655a134/'>Benjamin Muller</a> talk about using a point cloud to make a film about the city of St Gallen in Switzerland and you might be tempted to think … what a waste of time! Why not use the data to make better measurements that lead to better decisions? </p>
<p>How many IT projects have failed, not because they were based on bad decisions but because they failed to get people to adopt the changes? </p>
<p>The best decisions are meaningless unless they are adopted. </p>
<p>So, how do we get people to change or adopt the change we are trying to make? </p>
<p>I think the first thing to understand is that packaging matters! </p>
<p>This episode is a case study into wrapping our ideas in a story and visualizing them using geospatial data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a link to the visualizations that were created using the point cloud data</p>

<p>This is not a “get-rich-quick-scheme” its a story about someone like us who is earning money by using his geospatial skills to teach others.</p>
<p>Konrad Hafen is a hydrologist with the USGS and runs two websites and a youtube channel, he is a geospatial content creator who makes money from ads and from selling online courses. </p>

<p>Each episode I publish has some sort of editorial intent, the intent of this episode is to show you a real-life example of someone like us who is using their geospatial knowledge if a different way. </p>
<p>Not because I think this is for everyone! But because I think the more examples we are exposed to of people doing something different the more options we might see in our own lives. </p>
<p>We don’t have to take advantage of these opportunities but there is some comfort in knowing that they are there. That we are not stuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you listen to this episode and what to learn more about making money with geospatial content, Konrad and I will host a free webinar ( if we get enough interest! )  where we teach you the basics.

<p>Perhaps you have heard people talk about partitioning data or sharding data, you might have heard some of these terms used in the context of enterprise-scale geospatial systems and parallel processing and thought … Wow … that sounds daunting!</p>
<p>This podcast episode is meant to be a soft introduction to the world of distributed geospatial databases and some of the concepts surrounding them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Along the way, you will be introduced to something called <a href='https://sedona.apache.org/latest-snapshot/'>Apache Sedona</a> which is a cluster computing system for processing large-scale spatial data, and hear the surprising stat that 97% of enterprise data remains unused! … perhaps because of the lack of context?</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode covers a wide range of topics from the role of geospatial in systems thinking - representing natural systems in location systems and how we can apply the technology behind virtual worlds to the real world.</p>
<p>During this conversation, it became clear to me that technology should be used in service of culture and not the other way around. I think in terms of geospatial we have an interesting opportunity to have an outsized impact if we can just figure out how to market it! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I often think about problems as being either technological or cultural and it seems to me that technology generally moves faster than culture. Although I am sure we can all think of some great examples of huge cultural shifts that have happened in response to short-term emergencies in the past few years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Culture seems to react to technology as opposed to driving technology. I think if we were all better at marketing we could change this. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I often think about problems as being either technological or cultural and it seems to me that technology generally moves faster than culture.

<p>Culture seems to react to technology as opposed to driving technology. I think if we were all better at marketing we could change this. </p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>My guest on the show today is Mike. Today Mike is the founder of a software startup called ChroneChards, but he started as a cartographer for an adventure race and Patagonia.</p>
<p>So he has come a long way.</p>
<p>A couple of other really interesting points about Mike.</p>
<p>He is a self-taught software developer and he is a self-taught businessman.</p>
<p>The reason why I mentioned this means that if he can teach himself these things, then you can do it too.</p>
<p>And as you'll discover later on in the episode, all you have to do is to get really, really comfortable with uncertainty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can connect with Mike here <a href='https://chrono.cards/'>https://chrono.cards/</a></p>
<p>or on Twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/get_ChronoCards'>https://twitter.com/get_ChronoCards</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's probably worth riffing on this idea of uncertainty just for a minute. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think this is one thing that we all have in common. There'll be something about our lives, professional or private that we are uncertain about. </p>
<p>I've had the pleasure over the last three, four, or five years of talking with a few different people that have overcome a lot of uncertainty. </p>
<p>People that are self-taught software developers like Mike, people that have started their own GIS geospatial consultancies, and build their own businesses around their skills, none of those people have overcome uncertainty.</p>
<p>None of those people are now immune to uncertainty!</p>
<p>They have simply learned to live with it. </p>
<p>So as someone who has experienced and continues to experience a lot of uncertainty, these stories have really helped me they've really had a positive impact. It's been great to know that other people go through this too. </p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Well if the title does not grab your attention then this episode is not for you!
This episode is all about using AI to generate satellite imagery using generative adversarial networks ( GANs ).
That might sound scary if you have not used to working with AI but Ron Hagensieker does a brilliant job of walking us through the concept and the process.
Ron is the founder and CEO of OSIR.IO and you can reach out to him here: ron@osir.io

Dale walks you thought the evolution of the problems that Safe is solving, and gives you insight into the fallacy of the one “file to rule them all” theory and talks about trends in the geospatial file formats and data exchange in general.
We also discuss the future of Geospatial as an industry and from a practitioner’s perspective.   
Quotes from the interview
“.pdf is where data goes to die” 
“after the nuclear holocaust, there will be only cockroaches and shapefiles”

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this interview with Mike Dolbow, CEO of GeoHipster we talk about the opportunities within the geospatial industry that come with a deep understanding of a specific vertical. What newcomers to the industrial should think about focusing on and why. Mike debunks the 80% of all data has a spatial component myth and gives his perspectives on the future of the geospatial industry. 
All of this might sound a little dry and perhaps it would be if Mike was not so open, honest and passionate about the subjects we discuss. I really enjoyed this conversation and I am sure you will too.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Location gives context to data but it can also be used to give context to experiences. Radar is a platform for geofencing and location tracking. In this interview with Co founder Nick Patrick we discuss the opportunities around using location to deliver contextualised experiences to users, what these experiences look like today and what we can expect to see in the future.
