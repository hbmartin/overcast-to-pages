Abstract: People use the term “digital platform” to mean lots of different things—an internal business capability, a business model, a technology, a business service, or a mindset, among other things. To help executives discuss, design, and manage digital platforms, we studied platform designs. We identified four dominant digital platform designs—platform as a service (PaaS), multisided marketplace, internal platform, and X as a service (XaaS)—and found that companies that effectively managed one or more of the designs had above-average financial performance. In this briefing, we describe the designs and share the financial performance of companies using each design.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Today, by adopting a product mindset for data, organizations hold people accountable for the payoff of data investments over time. Data assets and data solutions represent two distinct types of “data products.” Organizations can use three sets of product management practices to more effectively generate returns from their data assets and data solutions: practices for satisfying data consumers, practices for setting prices, and practices for sustaining profits. This briefing illustrates these practices using examples from information businesses.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: In 2019, MIT CISR published findings from our research on the digital savviness of company boards that showed 24 percent of boards were digitally savvy and had associated performance premiums. In 2024, we repeated the 2019 board analysis with current companies and found that having a digitally savvy board based on our original criteria was no longer differentiating. However, updating the criteria to account for newer technologies produced results similar to the original analysis. In this briefing we compare the results of these two studies, share insights from interviews of non-executive board directors, and explore how companies use board committees to help manage their work.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: While organizations generally recognize data’s potential to drive business value, many still struggle to realize substantial financial returns from their data monetization strategies. Beyond selecting a strategy, we identified a more critical differentiator for success: data monetization impact. This briefing explores the strategy-specific practices that enable organizations to achieve this impact on strategic business outcomes, providing guidance for leaders seeking to maximize the return on their investments in data initiatives. </itunes:summary>

Abstract: Sustainability is a cost of doing business for many companies today—but it is also an opportunity for creating value. Companies only achieve value, however, by embedding sustainability goals into company strategy and then developing capabilities to advance these goals. Our survey analysis suggested that there are four distinct strategic sustainability goals: compliance and efficiency, customer and investor reputation, new revenue, and company purpose. Companies in the research that pursued strategic sustainability goals beyond compliance and efficiency saw bottom-line impacts such as greater EBIT, more revenues from innovation, and improved customer experience.</itunes:summary>

This briefing describes the MIT CISR Enterprise AI Maturity model, which depicts four stages of enterprise AI maturity we identified based on a 2022 MIT CISR survey of 721 companies. We found that financial performance improved at each stage, and we pinpointed capabilities an enterprise needs as it progresses through the stages. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Peter Weill reads MIT CISR's August 2024 research briefing, which he co-authored with Elizabeth van den Berg, Jason Birnbaum, and Maxime de Planta. See the text version and related content at https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2024_0801_RealTimeBusiness_WeillvanderBergBirnbaumdePlanta.

Abstract: In a study with Insight Partners, we found that companies operating in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile of “real-time-ness” had more than 50 percent higher revenue growth and net margins—a huge premium. The top-quartile companies automated processes and enabled fast decisions by employees at all levels using trusted and easily accessible data. Real-time decision-making enables digital customer journeys that are more seamless, empowered employee experiences, and increased business agility.

      <description>Peter Weill reads MIT CISR's August 2024 research briefing, which he co-authored with Elizabeth van den Berg, Jason Birnbaum, and Maxime de Planta. See the text version and related content at https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2024_0801_RealTimeBusiness_WeillvanderBergBirnbaumdePlanta.

Abstract: In a study with Insight Partners, we found that companies operating in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile of “real-time-ness” had more than 50 percent higher revenue growth and net margins—a huge premium. The top-quartile companies automated processes and enabled fast decisions by employees at all levels using trusted and easily accessible data. Real-time decision-making enables digital customer journeys that are more seamless, empowered employee experiences, and increased business agility. This briefing describes what it takes to become a real-time business. We dig into the performance premium and illustrate the journey of becoming a real-time business with a case study of United Airlines.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, large established organizations have been growing business value by increasing the volume of AI models they have in production, an activity we call scaling AI. MIT CISR research has identified that scaling AI is the result of a learning journey during which an organization learns how to deploy, proliferate, and industrialize AI models. Ideally, the organization builds data liquidity, develops workforce savviness, and leverages scarce resources along the way to achieve AI at scale, which is the state at which organizations cost effectively manage large volumes of interconnected models in production. In this briefing, we describe the AI scaling learning journey at Cemex, a large global construction materials company headquartered near Monterrey, Mexico.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Platform business models have become highly popular; they are used by half of the world’s ten largest companies by market capitalization. The challenge for established companies is that running a platform business is different from running a product business. A platform business requires building an ecosystem of various constituents with differing interests: customers, the company’s internal product teams, and partners. Based on an in-depth case study of Salesforce Platform, this briefing illustrates one approach to balancing the interests of these constituents.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: This briefing presents three principles to guide business leaders when making AI investments: invest in practices that build capabilities required for AI, involve all your people in your AI journey, and focus on realizing value from your AI projects. The principles are supported by the MIT CISR data monetization research, and the briefing illustrates them using examples from the Australia Taxation Office and CarMax. The three principles apply to any kind of AI, defined as technology that performs human-like cognitive tasks; subsequent briefings will present management advice distinct to machine learning and generative tools, respectively.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Ongoing digital transformation requires a workforce that is proficient in a wide variety of new skills. This briefing explores the use of AI in quantifying such proficiency, through a process known as skills inference. We introduce this concept by means of a case study of Johnson &amp; Johnson, showing how skills inference can provide detailed insight into workforce skills gaps and thereby guide employees’ career development and leaders’ strategic workforce planning.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Technology leaders in top-performing companies spend significantly more time on building a complementary enterprise capability than their peers. Carbon emission reduction is a top concern for organizations, and therefore developing an enterprise capability for digital sustainability is a compelling opportunity for technology leaders. In our study, technology leaders were building and using an enterprise tracking capability to pursue three opportunities for scaling carbon emission reduction at their companies: optimizing technology emissions and product emissions and creating digital offerings.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: In recent MIT CISR research, organizations saw their most challenging strategic goals as being dependent on the actions of other organizations. Ecosystem governance, like good corporate governance, is a key to achieving these goals. Executives in our research described three governance approaches for digital ecosystems that varied along a spectrum, from centralized, which we have termed “Alpha;” to federated, or “Representative;” to decentralized, or “Liquid.” In this briefing, we introduce these approaches and discuss when ecosystems should adopt more decentralized governance approaches to grow value.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: As large established companies become increasingly digital, offering connected products and services and leading or participating in ecosystems, their tech leaders must balance many demands and opportunities for their time. And as digital technologies have become pervasive in enterprises, these demands and opportunities often fall outside the traditional CIO role. In this briefing, we share how time allocations for tech leaders have changed over fifteen years, and Gail Evans, a technology leader at Disney Experiences, describes how she allocates her time.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Almost every company that we talk to is working on a digital business transformation—but with new opportunities such as generative AI emerging, transformation is becoming one of several ongoing priorities. When we started measuring transformation progress in 2017, companies were making good progress on becoming future ready; but at the end of 2022, transformation efforts were stalling. In this briefing, we examine why transformations stall—and what actions help companies maintain momentum, illustrated by the transformation journey of Dawn Foods.

Abstract: Recent MIT CISR survey data showed that nearly every participating organization had crafted a purpose statement. However, only half had defined the aspirations, propositions, and values that together comprise a comprehensive organizational purpose statement that can become ingrained in leaders’ strategic planning and teams’ decision-making. Drawing on MIT CISR survey data and a case study of Allstate Insurance, this research briefing describes how combining such a comprehensive organizational purpose with decentralized decision-making results in accelerated strategic objective realization and improved financial performance.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Stephanie Woerner reads MIT CISR's September 2023 research briefing, which she co-authored with Peter Weill. See the text version and related content at https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2023_0901_DomainOriented_WeillWoerner.

Abstract: A domain-oriented company helps serve a customer’s end-to-end need by focusing on customer outcomes rather than on the sales of products and services. In our latest survey, the companies we identified as being domain-oriented were top performers, with a huge premium on revenue growth and net margin. But taking a domain orientation requires a big mindset change of a company. In this briefing we explore what it takes to become a domain-oriented company and illustrate it with examples from Kaiser Permanente, Shopify, and Cemex.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Barb Wixom, co-author of Data Is Everybody's Business: The Fundamentals of Data Monetization, reads excerpts from the book. Published in September 2023 by the MIT Press, Data Is Everybody's Business is a clear, engaging, evidence-based guide to monetizing data, for everyone from employee to board member.

Most organizations view data monetization—converting data into money—too narrowly: as merely selling data sets. But data monetization is a core business activity for both commercial and noncommercial organizations, and, within organizations, it’s critical to have wide-ranging support for this pursuit. In Data Is Everybody’s Business, the authors offer a clear and engaging way for people across the entire organization to understand data monetization and make it happen. The authors identify three viable ways to convert data into money—improving work with data, wrapping products with data, and selling information offerings—and explain when to pursue each and how to succeed.

Key features of the book:
• Grounded in twenty-eight years of academic research,including nine years of research at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research (MIT CISR)
• Definitions of key terms, self-reflection questions, appealing graphics, and easy-to-use frameworks
• Rich with detailed case studies
• Supplemented by free MIT CISR website resources (cisr.mit.edu)

Ideal for organizations engaged in data literacy training, data-driven transformation, or digital transformation, Data Is Everybody’s Business is the essential guide for helping everybody in the organization—not just the data specialists—understand, get excited about, and participate in data monetization.</itunes:summary>

The authors identify three viable ways to convert data into money—improving work with data, wrapping products with data, and selling information offerings—and explain when to pursue each and how to succeed.

Key features of the book:
• Grounded in twenty-eight years of academic research,including nine years of research at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research (MIT CISR)
• Definitions of key terms, self-reflection questions, appealing graphics, and easy-to-use frameworks
• Rich with detailed case studies
• Supplemented by free MIT CISR website resources (cisr.mit.edu)

Ideal for organizations engaged in data literacy training, data-driven transformation, or digital transformation, Data Is Everybody’s Business is the essential guide for helping everybody in the organization—not just the data specialists—understand, get excited about, and participate in data monetization.</description>

Abstract: Just about every big old company is on a digital transformation journey, often without a playbook. In this briefing, we provide a digital transformation playbook—at least the first chapter. We answer the questions: what is digital business transformation, what percentage of firms have transformed, and how do they perform? We also share the four viable pathways for transformation and their pros and cons. As the goal for your company is not digital transformation, but rather business transformation using digital capabilities, we finish by providing some advice on how to choose a pathway that will help you achieve your business goals.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Most companies try to maximize value from IT investments by aligning IT and IT-enabled business processes with business strategy. But strategy rarely offers sufficiently clear direction for development of stable IT and business process capabilities. To make IT a proactive rather than reactive force in creating business value, companies should define an operating model. An operating model specifies the necessary level of business process integration and standardization for the company, defining critical IT and business process capabilities. This briefing explores how a company’s operating model guides IT investment and enhances business agility.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: To better serve customers and cut operating costs, firms are instituting enterprise-wide efforts to leverage synergies and reap economies of scale. CISR research indicates, however, that before firms can use IT strategically, they must learn how to make IT a strategic competency. A firm’s learning about the strategic role of IT can be represented in four stages of enterprise architecture maturity, with each stage compounding benefits for the firm. In this briefing we describe how firms capture and formalize the learning from each architectural stage so that they can benefit from the current stage and, if appropriate, migrate toward later stages.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Data monetization—the direct or indirect conversion of data and analytics into financial returns—represents a key source of economic value for companies in the digital economy. This briefing draws on findings from an MIT CISR data monetization survey of 315 executives, sharing insights regarding the current state of data monetization capabilities and their impact on data monetization performance. The briefing explains that data monetization capabilities are evolutionary and specific to the monetization approach, which means that digital leaders must be persistent and purposed as they make capability investments.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Many companies plan to achieve breakthrough performance via digitally enabled business transformation. They are now in the middle of the hard work of execution—implementing the difficult organizational changes needed to succeed. We call these changes “organizational explosions” because that’s what they feel like; they are significant, disruptive changes that affect most of a company’s customers, employees, and partners. In this briefing we share insights from the digital transformation journeys of companies in our research and we describe the four organizational explosions. We also highlight the impressive differences we observed in performance when we grouped these companies by whether they had completed more or less than 50% of their journey.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: MIT CISR research has found that interorganizational data sharing is a top concern of companies; leaders often find data sharing costly, slow, and risky. Interorganizational data sharing, however, is requisite for new value creation in the digital economy. Digital opportunities require data sharing 2.0: cross-company sharing of complementary data assets and capabilities, which fills data gaps and allows companies, often collaboratively, to develop innovative solutions. This briefing introduces three sets of practices—curated content, designated channels, and repeatable controls—that help companies accelerate data sharing 2.0.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Leaders are preparing their enterprises to be Future Ready. Whichever pathways are followed, there is typically a technology hurdle: the systems, data, and processes in the enterprise aren’t fit for becoming Future Ready. Therefore, the enterprise has to replatform, to get from the current “silos and spaghetti” set of systems to a set of Future-Ready platforms. We found four distinct approaches to enterprise replatforming—building an API layer, filling gaps with a partial replacement, migrating to a new Future-Ready platform, or undertaking a core replacement. This briefing will describe and illustrate each approach with an example from financial services, and discuss the financial performance findings.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: MIT CISR research has shown that senior leaders expect that digital transformation efforts will significantly affect 67 percent of employees. After all, it’s employees who have to adopt new systems, data, processes, and habits to deliver on the transformation. This briefing outlines just how employees are affected, by describing the employee experience along four distinct transformation pathways. We found that employees suffer from increased work complexity when companies follow pathways that prioritize developing customer-oriented capabilities over operational capabilities. Companies can improve their employee experience by first developing a foundation of required operational capabilities, or by doing so in small iterations by alternating with corresponding customer-oriented capabilities.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Our forthcoming book, Data is Everybody’s Business: The Fundamentals of Data Monetization, is mainly about how to create value from data, but for data monetization to occur, any value you create must be realized. Realizing value from data is about converting value created—efficiency or customer value—into money or getting money directly from data by selling it. In this briefing we define the concept of data monetization as it is used throughout the book and describe how to generate financial returns from improving work, wrapping products with data-fueled features and experiences, and selling information solutions.</itunes:summary>

MIT CISR research suggests that digital business transformations may be beginning to stall. In 2020, companies reported their transformations were 50 percent complete; but in 2022, transformations had progressed only to 55 percent complete. One key challenge for digital leaders struggling to generate momentum—consistent, ongoing progress—in a transformation is motivating other business leaders to commit to new goals and practices. In this research briefing, we discuss three sources of organizational inertia in digital business transformations, introduce three actions to generate momentum, and illustrate the actions using a case study from WABCO and ZF.</itunes:summary>

Organizations with advanced internal data sharing—the ability to easily exchange data assets enterprise-wide—benefit from greater data monetization returns and a lower cost to serve data assets to the organization’s data consumers. This briefing describes three requirements that enable internal data sharing: (1) creating broadly relevant liquid data assets, (2) becoming proficient in both data monetization and cost-to-serve measurement, and (3) developing a highly engaged data democracy. The requirements are illustrated using examples from Amcor, FEMSA, Fidelity Investments, and Scentre Group.</itunes:summary>

Achieving speed in its own in business doesn’t differentiate much. In this briefing, we identify four drivers of the combination of speed and innovation and discuss how it contributes to top performance. We describe how companies achieve this combination with a mix of enabling technologies and management mechanisms. Finally, we illustrate this approach with a case study of Mercedes-Benz that demonstrates how the company achieves resilience via combined speed and innovation.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Compelling use cases for technologies enabling Web3 are accumulating. In a 2022 MIT CISR survey, companies’ effectiveness at deploying new technologies such as blockchain was significantly correlated with growth and profitability. Yet only thirteen percent of executives described their companies as very effective at doing so. Thirty-six percent described them as only slightly or not at all effective at it. Digital leaders are faced with the question of how to build the capabilities needed to participate in value creation from Web3 while managing the risks of participation. In this briefing, we describe four approaches to adopting blockchain and illustrate them with industry examples.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Increasingly, large organizations are partnering with xTechs to supercharge their digital transformation. This is a symbiotic relationship: an xTech brings speed, innovation, and lower cost because xTechs don’t face the process, scale, and governance burdens of large organizations. In exchange, the xTech gains access via its large organization partner to capital, revenue, and cash flow, which support scaling quickly. But how successful are the partnerships in reality? We set out to learn about the motivations, rewards, and challenges of xTechs and organizations working together. This briefing, the first in a series on xTechs, shares our findings on successful partnering strategies in financial services.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Drawing on MIT CISR survey data, this research briefing describes how the extent to which an organization distributes operational decision rights to a majority of its teams can improve the speed at which the organization is able to sense and seize opportunities. By combining this approach with a set of practices that reduce bad complexity and promote the reuse of existing solutions, large established organizations can turn their size into an advantage—yielding increased innovative capacity and greater financial performance.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: This research briefing describes the organizational capability of scaling at scale, which we define as enabling multiple digital innovation initiatives to realize bottom-line value from their innovation by leveraging shared resources. We illustrate this concept with a case study from global multi-energy company Repsol, which implemented scaling at scale to cultivate a portfolio of more than 450 initiatives and helped over seventy percent of initiatives to reach the scale-up stage. As a result, over five years Repsol realized €800 million of bottom-line value from digital innovations.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: A liquid data asset is a cohesive set of data that a company has made accurate, available, combinable, relevant, secure, and readily usable for future value creation. Highly liquid data assets help companies exploit their dynamic capabilities to sense and seize business opportunities and transform organizational structures and resources accordingly. This exploitation in turn causes data assets to grow and improve. In this briefing, we explore the relationship between a company’s dynamic capabilities and its liquid data assets using the case of information solutions provider Healthcare IQ.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Saddled with legacy systems, complex processes, and siloed data, many firms have begun digital business transformations to improve customer experience and increase operational efficiency. We identify firms that have transformed on both of these dimensions as being Future Ready. MIT CISR research has identified ten future-ready capabilities that top-performing firms develop to achieve progress on both customer and operational dimensions and capture digital value.

See the text version and related content at https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2022_0801_ExplainingReplatforming_WoernerReynoldsHarteWeill.

Abstract: Enterprises today often replatform as part of their efforts to become Future Ready because the state of their existing systems, data, and processes hinders the organization’s ability to compete in the digital economy. In replatforming, an enterprise transitions legacy applications to cloud platforms and digitizes key components and capabilities. It’s critical that the enterprise’s board and top management team embrace replatforming for the effort to be successful; therefore, effectively explaining replatforming to these stakeholders is a skill that technology leaders, and eventually all leaders, must develop. This briefing describes the opportunities and risks of replatforming approaches and illustrates each approach graphically with a platform map.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Four characteristics of AI—unproven value, model opacity, model drift, and mindless application—make it challenging to get stakeholders to trust AI solutions. As a result, organizations that strive to become AI-powered adopt practices to produce AI solutions that are trustworthy. Over time, these practices build AI Explanation (AIX) capability: an emerging enterprise capability that arises from practices AI teams use to build stakeholder confidence in AI solutions. In this briefing, we first describe AIX capability and four sets of practices used to build it. We then draw on a case study about the AI journey of Microsoft to illustrate examples of the practices that company has leveraged.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: MIT CISR research identified that advanced levels of five data monetization capabilities –data science, data management, data platform, customer understanding, and acceptable data use—enable organizations to become AI-powered. In this briefing, we use a case study about AI at Microsoft to illustrate that organizations build advanced data monetization capabilities via the adoption of increasingly advanced practices. Further, we encourage leaders to take an enterprise capability perspective when capability building so that, over time, their AI projects become faster and cheaper to execute.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: MIT CISR research identified that advanced levels of five data monetization capabilities –data science, data management, data platform, customer understanding, and acceptable data use—enable organizations to become AI-powered. In this briefing, we use a case study about AI at Microsoft to illustrate that organizations build advanced data monetization capabilities via the adoption of increasingly advanced practices. Further, we encourage leaders to take an enterprise capability perspective when capability building so that, over time, their AI projects become faster and cheaper to execute.</description>

Abstract: Increasingly, companies partner across industries and sectors in new ways to solve complex challenges with innovative digital solutions. But the leaders of such ecosystem collaborations face two coordination challenges: uncertainty and interdependence. In this research briefing, we describe three managerial levers that can help ecosystem leaders coordinate ecosystem collaborations effectively by strengthening relationships and communication. We then describe the industry collaboration to create the New Payments Platform (NPP) in Australia and illustrate each lever using examples from the case.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: In our research, executives we talked with at many large companies noted that a pathway well-suited to one business unit may not work as well for another. In such cases, it makes sense for a company to progress on multiple pathways. There’s a big caveat, though: a company pursuing multiple pathways must coordinate across them or risk increasing complexity and fragmentation, with progress slowing down measurably. In this briefing, we share our research on companies pursuing multiple pathways, and describe the experiences of commercial bank Bancolombia as it progresses on and coordinates across multiple pathways.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: To generate greater value faster from digital innovation, many companies are increasing how much they learn from their own innovation efforts. However, in many companies, these changes are limited to one stakeholder group: innovation teams. Two other stakeholder groups, senior executives and experts from corporate functions, also need to learn from digital innovation initiatives. We have defined three learning imperatives that address a company’s needs to learn continually about building (1) a successful innovation, (2) a portfolio of initiatives that realizes strategic objectives faster, and (3) shared resources that propel multiple initiatives. All three imperatives involve collecting data regularly from digital innovation initiatives. In this research briefing we outline the three learning imperatives and provide examples of how companies are pursuing them to achieve strategic objectives more effectively and efficiently.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Creating a distinct digital unit or organization can help a company to recruit talent with specialized digital skills. Free from corporate legacy and with the decision rights to operate as a startup, such digital entities can disrupt the status quo and develop digital offerings. But to successfully scale these offerings, the digital entity and the parent company need to be strategically, operationally, and technologically aligned. This briefing describes how Toyota Motor North America uses a management practice called multi-capping to digitally disrupt itself while maintaining organizational alignment.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: In a digital business transformation, knowing where you are is as important as knowing where you want to go. To know where you are requires two important types of measures: those that indicate transformation success, such as progress and value creation; and those that track effectiveness at building capabilities future-ready companies must have to thrive in the digital era. The best tool we have seen companies use to know where they are is real-time dashboarding. In this briefing we share MIT CISR research on dashboarding, illustrating our findings using a case study from Schneider Electric.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Since 2019, MIT CISR has investigated fifty-two AI solutions to learn about AI scaling: growing the value created by both a core trained model and recontextualized adaptations of the model. This research has identified that scaling up happens when an AI solution moves from core model development to pilot to production, with increasing value creation. Further, scaling out happens when an AI model is trained using new data and new expertise, which are required for a new related application. This briefing describes both AI scaling dimensions within the context of an AI project journey at Pegasystems.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Data liquidity, the ease of data asset reuse and recombination accelerates the pursuit of new data monetization opportunities. This briefing introduces the concept of digital data asset, or DDA, as a pathway to building high data liquidity. A DDA is defined as a digital resource with three structural elements: value, modularity, and a programmatic interface. The unique structure of DDAs enables reuse and recombination of an organization’s data assets at an unprecedented scale. Open Banking efforts at Santander UK provide an excellent example of how data assets can be configured as DDAs and exposed to third parties at scale.</itunes:summary>

This briefing introduces the concept of data liquidity, defined as the ease of data asset reuse and recombination. While data is inherently reusable and recombinable, an organization must activate these characteristics by creating strategic data assets and building out its data monetization capabilities. As the company’s strategic data assets become more highly liquid and their number grows, data is made increasingly available for conversion to value, and the company’s data monetization accelerates. Fidelity is an excellent example of a company that is actively creating highly liquid strategic data assets for use enterprise wide.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Companies today are starting to walk the talk when it comes to treating data like a strategic firm asset—they are hiring chief data officers, and rolling out data literacy programs. This briefing describes what else is required for employees to believe that data can create value in new ways, that it can do so over and over and over again, and that everyone in the company can play a role. MIT CISR research indicates that leaders should build capabilities, optimize data monetization initiatives, and motivate pervasive data use, all of which can and should be measured.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: Companies can create new types of value in the digital era. In our research, we identified three types of value from digital business: value from operations, value from customers, and value from ecosystems. All three types of value were significant predictors of company performance, although their relative impacts varied. In this briefing, we describe the three types of value and show how they are captured in company performance. We then illustrate how two companies, Kaiser Permanente and Maersk, designed digital initiatives to create value from ecosystems—a new type of value for many large, traditional companies.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: In 2017 we first observed how almost every big old company was on a digital transformation journey, many without a playbook. We described the goal of business transformation—to become Future Ready—and four pathways we identified in our research that companies can follow to outperform their industry. In understanding how companies successfully get to Future Ready, we pinpointed four significant, disruptive changes common to all of the pathways, which we call “explosions.” In this briefing we update the research and highlight what we have learned over the last four years.</itunes:summary>

Abstract: For decades, companies have thought of themselves as operating in industries such as banking, retail, and energy. In contrast, most customers seek to fulfill specific needs—business customers might aim to manage their energy consumption, and consumers might navigate getting an education. We call these different customer problems and opportunities domains. Digital technologies, and new business models such as ecosystems, provide an opportunity to rethink how to solve your customers’ needs in each of their important domains. In this briefing, we share our first efforts at identifying the key domains, scope the size of the opportunity, and provide examples.</itunes:summary>

But few established companies are designed for digital. This book offers an essential guide for retooling organizations for digital success.

As a result, the authors explain, business design has become a critical management responsibility. Effective business design enables a company to quickly pivot in response to new competitive threats and opportunities.

      <itunes:summary>Most established companies have deployed such digital technologies as the cloud, mobile apps, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. But few established companies are designed for digital. This book offers an essential guide for retooling organizations for digital success. In the digital economy, rapid pace of change in technology capabilities and customer desires means that business strategy must be fluid. As a result, the authors explain, business design has become a critical management responsibility. Effective business design enables a company to quickly pivot in response to new competitive threats and opportunities. Most leaders today, however, rely on organizational structure to implement strategy, unaware that structure inhibits, rather than enables, agility. In companies that are designed for digital, people, processes, data, and technology are synchronized to identify and deliver innovative customer solutions―and redefine strategy. Digital design, not strategy, is what separates winners from losers in the digital economy.</itunes:summary>

In the rapidly changing digital economy, you can't succeed by merely tweaking management practices that led to past success. And yet, while many leaders and managers recognize the threat from digital—and the potential opportunity—they lack a common language and compelling framework to help them assess it and guide them in responding. They don't know how to think about their digital business model.

In their book What's Your Digital Business Model?: Six Questions to Help You Build the Next-Generation Enterprise, MIT digital research leaders Peter Weill and Stephanie Woerner provide a powerful yet straightforward framework to help managers and executives clarify where they are currently in an increasingly digital business landscape and highlight what's needed to move toward a higher-value digital business model.</itunes:summary>
