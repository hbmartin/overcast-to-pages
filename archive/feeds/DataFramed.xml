But as data sources multiply, so do the complexities around data privacy, customization, and ownership. How can companies capture and leverage the right data to create meaningful customer experiences while respecting privacy? And as data drives more personalized interactions, what steps can businesses take to protect sensitive information and navigate the increasingly complex regulatory picture?&nbsp;</p><p>Jonathan Bloch is CEO at Exchange Data International (EDI) and a seasoned businessman with 40 years experience in information provision. He started work in the newsletter industry and ran the US subsidiary of a UK public company before joining its main board as head of its publishing division. He has been a director and/or chair of several companies and is currently a non executive director of an FCA registered investment bank. In 1994 he founded Exchange Data International (EDI) a London based financial data provider. EDI now has over 450 clients across three continents and is based in the UK, USA, India and Morocco employing 500 people.</p><p>Scott Voigt is CEO and co-founder at Fullstory. Scott has enjoyed helping early-stage software businesses grow since the mid 90s, when he helped launch and take public nFront—one of the world's first Internet banking service providers. Prior to co-founding Fullstory, Voigt led marketing at Silverpop before the company was acquired by IBM.

These are known as AI agents or AI assistants. Since they’re small and narrow in scope, you probably want to create and use lots of them, which means you need to be able to create them cheaply and easily. I’m curious as to how you go about doing this from an organizational point of view. Who needs to be involved?

This helps teams building the software create better rituals and processes, while also ensuring quality and usability are key aspects to evaluate as the software is being built. We know this works in software development, but what happens when these practices are used when building AI tools?</p><p>Saurabh Gupta is a seasoned technology executive and is currently Chief Strategy &amp; Revenue Officer The Modern Data Company. With over 25 years of experience in tech, data and strategy, he has led many strategy and modernization initiatives across industries and disciplines. Through his career, he has worked with various Internation Organizations and NGOs, Public sector and Private sector organizations. Before joining TMDC, he was the Head of Data Strategy &amp; Governance at ThoughtWorks &amp; CDO/Director for Washington DC Gov., where he developed the digital/data modernization strategy for education data. Prior to DCGov he played leadership and strategic roles at organizations including IMF and World Bank where he was responsible for their Data strategy and led the OpenData initiatives.

This helps teams building the software create better rituals and processes, while also ensuring quality and usability are key aspects to evaluate as the software is being built. We know this works in software development, but what happens when these practices are used when building AI tools?</p><p>Saurabh Gupta is a seasoned technology executive and is currently Chief Strategy &amp; Revenue Officer The Modern Data Company.

Most of the work already completed in the AI space has been industry-led, with large organizations pushing AI forward to improve their efficiency as businesses and to create new avenues for revenue. This focus on industry and revenue can potentially create more inequality in the world, with companies not interested in the negative effects of AI being driven by profit, towards profit. To combat this, the UN has set up an AI Advisory Board, with members from different nationalities, backgrounds and expertises to ensure that AI is for all, and not just for profit. In this episode, we speak to two members of the board.&nbsp;</p><p>Ian Bremmer is a political scientist who helps business leaders, policy makers, and the general public make sense of the world around them. He is president and founder of Eurasia Group, the world's leading political risk research and consulting firm, and GZERO Media, a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs.</p><p>Ian is credited with bringing the craft of political risk to financial markets, creating Wall Street's first global political risk index (GPRI), and for establishing political risk as an academic discipline. His definition of emerging markets— "those countries where politics matters at least as much as economics for market outcomes”—has become an industry standard. “G-Zero,” his term for a global power vacuum in which no country is willing and able to set the international agenda, is widely used by policymakers and thought leaders.</p><p>A prolific writer, Ian is the author of eleven books, including two New York Times bestsellers, “Us vs Them: The Failure of Globalism” which examines the rise of populism across the world, and his latest book “The Power of Crisis: How Three Threats—and Our Response—Will Change the World” which details a trio of looming global crises (health emergencies, climate change, and technological revolution) and outlines how governments, corporations, and concerned citizens can use these crises to create global prosperity and opportunity.</p><p>Jimena Viveros currently serves as the Chief of Staff and Head Legal Advisor to Justice Loretta Ortiz at the Mexican Supreme Court.

Most of the work already completed in the AI space has been industry-led, with large organizations pushing AI forward to improve their efficiency as businesses and to create new avenues for revenue. This focus on industry and revenue can potentially create more inequality in the world, with companies not interested in the negative effects of AI being driven by profit, towards profit. To combat this, the UN has set up an AI Advisory Board, with members from different nationalities, backgrounds and expertises to ensure that AI is for all, and not just for profit. In this episode, we speak to two members of the board.&nbsp;</p><p>Ian Bremmer is a political scientist who helps business leaders, policy makers, and the general public make sense of the world around them. He is president and founder of Eurasia Group, the world's leading political risk research and consulting firm, and GZERO Media, a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs.</p><p>Ian is credited with bringing the craft of political risk to financial markets, creating Wall Street's first global political risk index (GPRI), and for establishing political risk as an academic discipline. His definition of emerging markets— "those countries where politics matters at least as much as economics for market outcomes”—has become an industry standard. “G-Zero,” his term for a global power vacuum in which no country is willing and able to set the international agenda, is widely used by policymakers and thought leaders.</p><p>A prolific writer, Ian is the author of eleven books, including two New York Times bestsellers, “Us vs Them: The Failure of Globalism” which examines the rise of populism across the world, and his latest book “The Power of Crisis: How Three Threats—and Our Response—Will Change the World” which details a trio of looming global crises (health emergencies, climate change, and technological revolution) and outlines how governments, corporations, and concerned citizens can use these crises to create global prosperity and opportunity.</p><p>Jimena Viveros currently serves as the Chief of Staff and Head Legal Advisor to Justice Loretta Ortiz at the Mexican Supreme Court. Her prior roles include national leadership positions at the Federal Judicial Council, the Ministry of Security, and the Ministry of Finance, where she held the position of Director General. Jimena is a lawyer and AI expert, and possesses a broad and diverse international background. She is in the final stages of completing her Doctoral thesis, which focuses on the impact of AI and autonomous weapons on international peace and security law and policy, providing concrete propositions to achieve global governance from diverse legal perspectives. Her extensive work in AI and other legal domains has been widely published and recognized.</p><p>In the episode, Richie, Ian and Jimena cover what the UN's AI Advisory Body was set up for, the opportunities and risks of AI, how AI impacts global inequality, key principles of AI governance, the implementation of that governance, the future of AI in politics and global society, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Links Mentioned in the Show:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/ai-advisory-body" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UN Interim Report: Governing AI for Humanity</a></li><li><a href="https://globalgoals.withgoogle.com/globalgoals/globalgoals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AI for Sustainable Development Goals</a></li><li><a href="https://g.co/kgs/ijsFv6G" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Power of Crisis: How Three Threats – and Our Response – Will Change the World by Ian Bremmer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/davos-2024-sam-altman-on-the-future-of-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WEF Davos 2024: Sam Altman on the future of AI</a></li><li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/artificial-intelligence-ai-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Course] Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy</a></li><li>Related Episode: <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/podcast/what-to-expect-from-ai-in-2024-with-craig-s-smith" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What to Expect from AI in 2024 with Craig S.

With Trond Arne Undheim, Research Scholar in Global Systemic Risk at Stanford University</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's been almost a year since ChatGPT was released, mainstreaming AI into the collective consciousness in the process. Since that moment, we've seen a really spirited debate emerge within the data &amp; AI communities, and really public discourse at large. The focal point of this debate is whether AI is or will lead to existential risk for the human species at large.</p><p>We've seen thinkers such as Elizier Yudkowski, Yuval Noah Harari, and others sound the alarm bell on how AI is as dangerous, if not more dangerous than nuclear weapons. We've also seen AI researchers and business leaders sign petitions and lobby government for strict regulation on AI.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, we've also seen luminaries within the field such as Andrew Ng and Yan Lecun, calling for, and not against, the proliferation of open-source AI. So how do we maneuver this debate, and where does the risk spectrum actually lie with AI? More importantly, how can we contextualize the risk of AI with other systemic risks humankind faces? Such as climate change, risk of nuclear war, and so on and so forth? How can we regulate AI without falling into the trap of regulatory capture—where a select and mighty few benefit from regulation, drowning out the competition in the meantime?</p><p>Trond Arne Undheim is a Research scholar in Global Systemic Risk, Innovation, and Policy at Stanford University, Venture Partner at Antler, and CEO and co-founder of Yegii, an insight network with experts and knowledge assets on disruption.

Since that moment, we've seen a really spirited debate emerge within the data &amp; AI communities, and really public discourse at large. The focal point of this debate is whether AI is or will lead to existential risk for the human species at large.</p><p>We've seen thinkers such as Elizier Yudkowski, Yuval Noah Harari, and others sound the alarm bell on how AI is as dangerous, if not more dangerous than nuclear weapons. We've also seen AI researchers and business leaders sign petitions and lobby government for strict regulation on AI.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, we've also seen luminaries within the field such as Andrew Ng and Yan Lecun, calling for, and not against, the proliferation of open-source AI. So how do we maneuver this debate, and where does the risk spectrum actually lie with AI? More importantly, how can we contextualize the risk of AI with other systemic risks humankind faces? Such as climate change, risk of nuclear war, and so on and so forth? How can we regulate AI without falling into the trap of regulatory capture—where a select and mighty few benefit from regulation, drowning out the competition in the meantime?</p><p>Trond Arne Undheim is a Research scholar in Global Systemic Risk, Innovation, and Policy at Stanford University, Venture Partner at Antler, and CEO and co-founder of Yegii, an insight network with experts and knowledge assets on disruption.

Over the past year hosting the DataFramed podcast, we've had the incredible privilege of having biweekly conversations with data leaders at the forefront of the data revolution. This has led to fascinating conversations on the future of the modern data stack, the future of data skills, and how to build organizational data literacy. </p>
<p>However, as the DataFramed podcast grows, we want to be able to provide the data science community across the spectrum from practitioners to leaders, with distilled insights that will help them manoeuvre their careers effectively. And we want to do that more often. </p>
<p>This is why we’re excited to announce the launch of a four-day DataFramed Careers Series. Throughout next week, we will interview four different thought leaders and experts about what it takes to break into data science in 2022, best practices to stand out from the crowd, building a brand in data science, and more. Moreover, this episode series will mark DataFramed’s transition from biweekly to weekly.</p>
<p>Starting Monday the 30th of May, DataFramed will become a weekly podcast.</p>
<p>For next week’s DataFramed Careers Series, we’ll be covering the ins and outs of building a career in data, and the different aspects of standing out from the crowd during the job hunt. We’ll be hearing from Sadie St Lawrence, CEO and Founder of Women in Data on what it takes to launch a data career in 2022. Nick Singh, Co-author of Ace the Data Science Interview and 2nd time guest of DataFramed will join us to discuss what makes a great data science portfolio project. Khuyen Tran, Developer Advocate at Prefect on will outline how writing can accelerate a data career, and Jay Feng, CEO of Interview Query will join us to provide tips and frameworks on acing the data science interview.</p>
<p>For future DataFramed episodes, we’ll definitely still cover the different aspects of building a data-driven organization, cover the latest advancements in data science, building data careers, and more. So expect more varied guests, topics, and more specials series like this one in the future.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing the DataFramed Careers Series.

In the age of COVID-19, these issues are far more acute. We also know that governments and businesses exploit crises to consolidate and rearrange power, claiming that citizens need to give up privacy for the sake of security. But is this tradeoff a false dichotomy? And what type of tools are being developed to help us through this crisis?

In the age of COVID-19, these issues are far more acute. We also know that governments and businesses exploit crises to consolidate and rearrange power, claiming that citizens need to give up privacy for the sake of security. But is this tradeoff a false dichotomy? And what type of tools are being developed to help us through this crisis? In this episode, Katharine Jarmul, Head of Product at Cape Privacy, a company building systems to leverage secure, privacy-preserving machine learning and collaborative data science, will discuss all this and more, in conversation with Dr. Hugo Bowne-Anderson, data scientist and educator at DataCamp.<b>Links from the show</b></p>

Sean’s work on the Exploration team uses cutting edge theories and tools to build proofs of concept. At TD Ameritrade they think about a wide array of questions from conversational agents that can help customers quickly get to information that they need and going beyond chatbots. They use modern time series analysis and more advanced techniques like recurrent neural networks to predict the next time a customer might call and what they might be calling about, as well as helping investors leverage alternative data sets and make more informed decisions.</p>

<p>They’re going to be talking about how data science is facing a credibility crisis that is manifesting itself in different ways in different industries, how and why expectations aren’t met and many stakeholders are disillusioned. You’ll see that if the crisis isn’t prevented, the data science labor market may cease to be a seller’s market and we’ll have big missed opportunities. But this isn’t an episode of Black Mirror so they’ll also discuss how to avoid the crisis, taking detours through the role of randomized control trials in data science, the rise of methods borrowed from econometrics and how to set realistic expectations around what data science can and can’t do.<b>LINKS FROM THE SHOW</b></p>

Marco and Hugo will talk about the role of data science in large-scale bets and bookmaking, how Marco is training an army of data scientists and much more. At Pinnacle, Marco uses tight risk-management built on cutting-edge models to provide bets not only on sports but on questions such as who will be the next pope? Who will be the world hot dog eating champion, who will land on mars first and who will be on the iron throne at the end of game of thrones. They’ll discuss the relations between risk management and uncertainty, how great forecasters are necessarily good at updating their predictions in the light of new data and evidence, how you can model this using Bayesian inference and the future of biometric sensing in sports betting. And, as always, much, much more.<b>LINKS FROM THE SHOW</b></p>

Marco and Hugo will talk about the role of data science in large-scale bets and bookmaking, how Marco is training an army of data scientists and much more. At Pinnacle, Marco uses tight risk-management built on cutting-edge models to provide bets not only on sports but on questions such as who will be the next pope? Who will be the world hot dog eating champion, who will land on mars first and who will be on the iron throne at the end of game of thrones. They’ll discuss the relations between risk management and uncertainty, how great forecasters are necessarily good at updating their predictions in the light of new data and evidence, how you can model this using Bayesian inference and the future of biometric sensing in sports betting. And, as always, much, much more.<b>LINKS FROM THE SHOW</b></p>

Angela will talk about how to get into data science management, the most important strategies to ensure that your data science team delivers value to the organization, how to hire data scientists and key points to consider as your data science team grows over time, in addition to the types of trade-offs you need to make as a data science manager and how you make the right ones.

Tanya started her career in bioinformatics and has applied her experience to other industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, and sports. We’ll be talking about what it means to be a data consultant, the wide range of industries that Tanya works in, the impact of data products in her work and the importance of rapid prototyping and getting MVPs or minimum viable products out the door. How does Tanya balance the trade-off between rapid prototyping and building fully mature data products? How does this play out in particular cases in the healthcare and telecommunications spaces? How has her ability to do this evolved as a function of open source software development?
