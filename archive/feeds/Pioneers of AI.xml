      <title>How to build robots that can live alongside us, with Cynthia Breazeal</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Over the past several decades, the field of robotics has achieved remarkable milestones. Robots have been sent to Mars and to the deepest parts of the ocean. Cynthia Breazeal, a professor at the MIT Media Lab, believes there’s another frontier that robots should enter: our daily lives. As a pioneer in social robotics, Breazeal has devoted her career to developing socially and emotionally intelligent machines — robots that can serve as learning partners in classrooms and even assist in navigating mental health challenges. She joins Pioneers of AI to discuss how social robots can coexist with humans, explore the applications of the robots she’s developing, and explain why AI literacy is more important than ever.</p><p>Learn more about Pioneers of AI: <a href="http://pioneersof.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://pioneersof.ai/</a></p><p>Follow Pioneers of AI on all channels: <a href="https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai</a></p><p>At the center of AI is people, so we want to hear from you!

      <title>How AI helps women track hormonal health, with Marina Pavlovic Rivas</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Women’s health has historically been understudied and underfunded. And when it comes to women’s hormonal health, we’re missing some critical data. Marina Pavlovic Rivas is working to close that gap by leveraging AI. Her company, Eli Health, offers an at-home monitor that tracks hormonal levels through saliva, giving women access to health data that is typically difficult to access. In this episode, we explore the root causes of the women’s health gap, how AI can offer a new level of access to healthcare, and why obtaining this longitudinal data is so critical.</p><p>Learn more about Pioneers of AI: <a href="http://pioneersof.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://pioneersof.ai/</a></p><p>Follow Pioneers of AI on all channels: <a href="https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai</a></p><p>At the center of AI is people, so we want to hear from you!

      <itunes:title>How AI helps women track hormonal health, with Marina Pavlovic Rivas</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:summary>Women’s health has historically been understudied and underfunded. And when it comes to women’s hormonal health, we’re missing some critical data. Marina Pavlovic Rivas is working to close that gap by leveraging AI. Her company, Eli Health, offers an at-home monitor that tracks hormonal levels through saliva, giving women access to health data that is typically difficult to access. In this episode, we explore the root causes of the women’s health gap, how AI can offer a new level of access to healthcare, and why obtaining this longitudinal data is so critical.

      <title>Your next manager could be powered by AI, with Katherine von Jan</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A great manager can make a person feel more satisfied and included at work, and set them on a great career trajectory. But a bad manager can cost a company lots of time and money, or even drive away valuable talent. Katherine von Jan is building a better manager, powered by AI. As CEO and co-founder of Tough Day, von Jan is building AI management tools based on the best leaders and latest research, tailored for a company's values and norms. Tough Day might handle basic questions about PTO, but it might also help with sensitive stuff like addressing workplace conflict before it escalates. In this episode of Pioneers of AI, we explore why AI could be great for the future of management, the concept of un-bossing, and von Jan’s inspiration for Tough Day.</p><p>Learn more about Pioneers of AI: <a href="http://pioneersof.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://pioneersof.ai/</a></p><p>Follow Pioneers of AI on all channels: <a href="https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/pioneersofai</a></p><p>At the center of AI is people, so we want to hear from you!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Love, dating, and AI — what could go wrong? Or right? In this Valentine’s Day special, Rana el Kaliouby and a series of expert guests explore how AI is reshaping romance. First, Will Wu, Chief Technology Officer at Match Group, gives us a peek at how AI is already at work in apps like Tinder and Hinge, helping users choose their best profile pictures and refining match recommendations. Next, the team at Gottman Inc. shares how AI is being used to improve relationships. Their AI-powered tools analyze conversations and help therapists guide couples. The goal? Better communication, healthier relationships, and maybe even fewer breakups. Finally, we meet Violeta and her AI husband.
