      <title>#279 - Qing 19: The Treaty of Nerchinsk</title>
      <description>In an epic handshake of history, the Qing and Russian Empires hammer out the first major treaty between East and West. It's good for Great Qing, it's maybe good for Russia... but it's definitely not good for the Mongols who got iced out of the negotiations by a couple of Puritan hustlers, like Galdan Khan and his harried host of Dzungars. Not good news at all...

      <title>#276 - Qing 18: Kangxi Gets Personal</title>
      <description>The Kangxi Emperor of Great Qing squares off again Galdan Khan of the Dzungar Khanate in the sociopolitical-religio-military showdown of the late 17th century! Kangxi wants to flex his imperial muscle - in person! - up to and including enacting a "Final Solution" against the un-subdued Mongol peoples under Galdan, but the wily khan will amply demonstrate that all the imperial planning from Beijing in the world means nothing once your army is out in the wilds of the steppe.

Kangxi wants to flex his imperial muscle - in person! - up to and including enacting a "Final Solution" against the un-subdued Mongol peoples under Galdan, but the wily khan will amply demonstrate that all the imperial planning from Beijing in the world means nothing once your army is out in the wilds of the steppe.

      <title>#275 - Qing 17: Office of Barbarian Control</title>
      <description>With its southern border finally pacified, the Qing Dynasty under its Kangxi Emperor must now contend with a rising challenge to the northeast: the ascent and enthronement of a real steppe wildcard, the chieftain Galdan, as reigning Khan of the Dzungar Mongols. Kangxi will strive to use him as he has used all other neighboring petty-potentates - as semi-disposable ablative armor for the soft innards of China proper under the longstanding guidelines of "Use The Barbarians to Deal With the Barbarians" foreign policy... but Galdan is mercurial enough to have ideas of his own, and friends in surprisingly high places (the Tibetan Highlands).

Time Period Covered:
~1679-1684 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Great Qing:
The Kangxi Emperor (Aisin Gioro Xuanye) [r. 1661-1722]

      <title>#274 - Qing 16: A Whole New Frontier</title>
      <description>Across the trackless expanses of the northwestern frontier zones, far beyond the final vestiges of Great Qing sovereignty or protection, independent, oasis trade hubs survive and even thrive across central Asia during the chaos of the 16th &amp; 17th centuries. They and their denizens, though largely cut off from the rest of the wider world, nevertheless serve a vital – though fragile – linkage between east and west. Here, north of the Taklamakan Desert, the Oirat Mongols continue to live much as they have these past several centuries… until a group known as the Dzungars under a rising leader called Batur Hong Taiji will start dreaming bigger: an Albany Plan of Union… with Mongol characteristics…

Time Period Covered:
~1680 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Four Oirat/Dzungar Mongols:
Baibagas Khan [r. 1585-1640]
Chechen Khan (Ochirtu) [r. 1640~1670]
Zaya Pandita [d. 1662]
Khara Khula [d. 1634]
Batur Hongtaiji [r. 1634-1653]
Sengge [r. 1653-1671]
Queen Anu of the Khoshuts [~1653-1696]
Boshoghtu Khan (Galdan) [1644-1697, r. 1671-97]

Other Mongols:
Altan Khan of the Golden Horde
Jasaku Khan of the Khalkhas

Dge-lugs-pa Tibetan Buddhist Sect:
The 5th Dalai Lama (Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso] [1617-1682]

Great Qing:
The Kangxi Emperor (Aisin Gioro Xuanye) [r. 1661-1722]

      <title>#273 - Qing 15: Something Rotten In the Heir</title>
      <description>With border disputes and foreign affair emergencies levelling off, the Kangxi Emperor is able to turn his attentions inward toward the domestic, the home and hearth. But it's not all bbqs and pickleball there, either - there's the questions of succession, for one... who will be next when Kangxi is no more? And an heir there is... but... does something seem a little *off* about the crown-prince??

Time Period Covered:
~1660-1722 CE

Major Historical Figures:
The Kangxi Emperor (Xuanye) [r. 1661-1722]
Yunreng, Heir-apparent [1674-1725]
Prime Minister Songgotu [1636-1703]

      <title>#271 - Mongol 9: The Immortal</title>
      <description>As he feels the inevitable passage of time take its toll on his body and soul, Genghis Khan looks for answers - about how to extend his rule and his life, perhaps even how to gain life everlasting. Thus, when word reaches him on the eve of his Khwarazmian campaign of a Daoist Immortal living in the mountains of Shandong, he will seek this master out in order to gain his wisdom. But this supposed immortal isn't quite what he claims to be...

Time Period Covered:
ca. 1219-1224 CE

Major Figures:
Genghis Khan (Temüjin)
Master Changchun, Leader of the Daoist Quanzhen Sect (Qiu Chuji)
Temuge-otchigin, Hearthkeeper of Mongolia
Liu Wen, alchemist, arrow-maker, caravan-leader
Yelu Chu Chi, brother of the Governor of Samarkand, translator for the Great Khan

      <title>#256 - Qing 2: Greeted As Liberators</title>
      <description>Beijing has been brutally captured, with the Ming emperor committing suicide rather than face the bandit army of Li Zicheng. However, before he can get comfortable, the full might of the Qing are on their way to "liberate" the Chinese empire from, well, the Chinese.

Apr. 1644- Nov. 1645

Major Historical Figures:
Qing:
The Shunzhi Emperor (Aisin Gyoro Fulin) [r. 1643-1661]
Dorgon, Prince Ruizhong [1612-1650]
Ajige, Prince Ying [1605-1651]
Dodo, Prince Yu [1614-1649]
Prime Minister Fan Wencheng [1597-1666]

Ming:
The Chongzhen Emperor [r. 1627-1644]
General Wu Sangui [1612-1678]
General Hong Chengchou [1593-1665]
General Zuo Liangyu [1599-1645]
General Shi Kefa [1601-1645]

      <title>Bonus - Mongol 6: Agent of Chaos</title>
      <description>It's been a hot summer, and a long break for me! Let's get back into things with a little extra Mongol action...

“The imperial city was ripped open … Zhongdu was not one but four cities. We took each of them in turn, methodically killing and razing everything that dared stand upright under Tenggeri. The palaces and gardens of the King of Gold [Jin] were ransacked, revealing such riches that the tribute paid three seasons before by the Jin emperor now seem derisory and humiliating.
“A whole moon was needed to collect the bodies and count them. And the city burned for another moon still, creating such a stench that even the scavengers kept away.”
- Jöchi, ca. 1215

      <title>#254 - Qing 1: Build Me An Army Worthy of Manchu</title>
      <description>As the newly enthroned Khan of the Manchus, Hong Taiji has a lot of plates to keep spinning. Conquest of Joseon Korea to the east, conquest of the Chahar Mongols to the west, and continuing to pound against the ever-weakening Ming Dynasty to the south. But he still has time for aesthetic considerations, such as the fact that names like "Jurchen" and "Jin" are so passé, while names like "Manchu" and "Qing" are the new hotness.

1626-1643 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Qing:
Hong Taiji (Emperor Taizong of Qing) [r. 1626-1643]
Prince Amin [1585-1640]
Prince Haoge [1609-1648]
Prince Dorgon [1612-1650]
Prince Fulin (The Shunzi Emperor) [r. 1643-1661]

Ming:
Gen. Mao Wenlong [1576-1629]
Gen. Yuan Chonghuan [1584-1630]
Gen. Zu Dashou [d. 1656]
Gen. Hong Chenchou [1593-1665]
Gen. Wu Sangui [1612-1678]

      <title>#253 - Ming 38: Manchus, and Pirates, and Rebels, Oh My!</title>

After purging his government of partisan elements, he find he's now condemned it to hopeless deadlock.

Economic and currency woes lead, combined with repeated natural catastrophes lead to widespread banditry and rebel factions doing what they must to survive... and through it all, the Manchu threat to the north continue to press its advantage, breaking through the Great Wall, and going so far as to raid around Beijing itself!

Ming Empire:
The Chongzhen Emperor (Zhu Yujian) [r. 1628-1644]
General Yuan Conghuan [1584-1630]

      <description>Great Ming's 15th emperor steps up to bat at the tender age of 15, but he's not terribly interested in tackling the challenges facing the empire.

Time Period Covered:
1620-1627 CE

Major Historical Figures:
The Tianqi Emperor (Zhu Youjiao) [r. 1620-1627]
Exalted Duke Wei Zhongxian [1568-1627]
Madame Ke [1605-1627]
Minister of War Cui Chengxiu [1571-1627]
Grand Secretary Ye Xianggao [1559-1627]
Minister Liu Zongzhou [1578-1645]
Vice Censor-in-Chief Yang Lian [1572-1625]
Xu Hengru, White Lotus rebel leader [d. 1623]
The Chongzhen Emperor (Zhu Yujian) [r. 1627-1644]

      <title>#246 - 2022 Retrospective/Archive: The Mathematician of Heaven</title>
      <description>First a brief lookback on the crazy, nutso year that was 2022, as our intrepid host deals with an unfortunate year-end bout of COVID... Then, a reach deep into the archives for an oldie, but goodie from a few centuries ago...
This short episode covers the life of one of the great mathematicians, astronomers, and engineers of ancient China: Zu Chongzhi. In his life from 429-500 CE, he will re-create an ancient precursor to the compass that had been lost for centuries, calculate the motions of the celestial objects with a degree of accuracy in excess of 99.9%, design a comprehensive new calendar system, and derive the value of π to a degree of accuracy that would not be surpassed the world over for another millennium.

      <title>#245 - Ming 31: Event Horizon</title>
      <description>Being the most powerful person in the empire must be nothing but the good life, right? Well... not so much. And especially with the truly dysfunctional Ming system facing the newly-adult Wanli Emperor, it's a system that promises all the perks, but delivers only drudgery, frustration, and disappointment. Not even 5,000 concubines can make up for that...

Time Period Covered:
1582-1600 CE

Major Historical Figures:
The Wanli Emperor (Zhu Yizhun) [r. 1572-1620]
Empress Xiaoduan (Wang Xijie) [1564-1620]
Noble Consort Wang [1565-1611]
Prince Zhu Changluo, "First Imperial Son" [1582-1620]
Noble Consort Zheng [1565-1630]
Prince Zhu Changxun, "Third Imperial Son" [1586-1641]

Not even 5,000 concubines can make up for that...

      <title>#244 - Ming 30: A Last Luminous Gloaming</title>
      <description>At 29, the weak and ineffectual Longqing Emperor take the Dragon Throne in 1567. But it won't be long before the curse of the House of Zhu strikes him down, leaving Great Ming to his 9-year-old son, Wanli.

The Longqing Emperor (Zhu Zaihou) [r. 1567-1572]
The Wanli Emperor (Zhu Yijun) [r. 1567-1620]
Grand Secretary Xu Jie [1503-1583]
Grand Secretary Gao Gong [1513-1578]
Senior Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng [1525-1582]

      <title>Update: Network Change - Airwave</title>
      <description>Someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins. If you look for it, you can see these little dots come into the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call 'em "cigarette burns."
That's the cure for a changeover. He flips the projector, the movie keeps right on going, and nobody in the audience has any idea.

In which THoC begins a glorious partnership with Airwave Media.

      <description>We're rascals and scoundrels, we're villains and knaves.
We're devils and black sheep, we're really bad eggs.
We're beggars and blighters and ne'er do-well cads,
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads,
Stand up me hearties, yo ho!
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!

ca. 1521-1550 CE

      <title>#240 - Ming 27: The Solecism of Power</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/240-ming-27-the-solecism-of-power</link>
      <description>The Jiajing Emperor rounds out the back-half of his interminably long reign by hiding away in his personal palace, and only occasionally coming out to tell everyone what a terrible job they're all doing. The Mongols seize on Ming weakness to basically do whatever they want, and the Ming respond by turtling even harder and building more walls. Without a imperial guiding hand, the ministers are left to their own devices... with predictably selfish and myopic results.

Time Period Covered:
1550-1567 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Ming Empire:
The Jiajing Emperor (Zhu Houcong) [r. 1521-1567]
Gen. Qiu Ruan [d. 1552]
Grand Secretary Xia Yan [1482-1548]
Grand Secretary Yan Song [1480-1567]
Grand Secretary Xu Jie [1512-1578]

Mongolia:
Altan Khan [1507-1582]
Prince Toghto

Major Works Cited:
Bacon, Francis. “Of empire” in The essays of Francis Bacon (1908).
Geiss, James. “The Chia-ching reign, 1522-1566,” in The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 7: the Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644, Part I.

        <![CDATA[<p>The Jiajing Emperor rounds out the back-half of his interminably long reign by hiding away in his personal palace, and only occasionally coming out to tell everyone what a terrible job they're all doing. The Mongols seize on Ming weakness to basically do whatever they want, and the Ming respond by turtling even harder and building more walls. Without a imperial guiding hand, the ministers are left to their own devices... with predictably selfish and myopic results.</p><p><br></p><p>Time Period Covered:</p><p>1550-1567 CE</p><p><br></p><p>Major Historical Figures:</p><p>Ming Empire:</p><p>The Jiajing Emperor (Zhu Houcong) [r. 1521-1567]</p><p>Gen.

      <description>Let the state be small and the people few:
So that the people…
fearing death, will be reluctant to move great distances
and, even if they have boats and carts, will not use them.
So that the people…
Will find their food sweet and their clothes beautiful,
will be content with where they live and happy in their customs.
Though adjoining states be within sight of one another
and cocks crowing and dogs barking in one can be heard in the next,
yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another.

      <title>#236 - Yuan 17: The Golden Prince &amp; The Warrior Queen</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/236-yuan-17-the-golden-prince-the-warrior-queen</link>
      <description>In the chaos that grips the steppes in the mid 15th century, anarchy reins. Though there are though who call themselves khans, they were merely figureheads controlled by their own prime ministers, the taishis. The once mighty Borjigin Clan has been bled nearly dry, and usurpers are over every hill crest.

Into this world of destruction and disarray, two children are born on opposite sides of the vast Gobi. The first is one of the last members of the House of Borjigin, a boy called Bayan Möngke, who will in time become the heir to the office of Great Khan of the Mongols. The other a girl of seemingly little significance, Mandukhai, who will be given to the sitting Khan in marriage as his second queen.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/234-ming-24-the-grand-rites-controversy</link>
      <description>With the Zhengde Emperor dead without an heir, the succession is in question and rebellion brewing. Fortunately, Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe has planned for this and calls in his backup - the 13-year-old Prince of Xing, Zhengde's younger cousin. He'll come to power as the Jiajing Emperor... but Secretary Yang will very quickly find out that, though young, Jiajing is a spitfire who's here to play the game, not be played.

Time Period Covered:
1519-1524 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Zhu Houcong (The Jiajing Emperor) [r. 1521-1567]
Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe [1459-1529]
Empress Dowager Zhang [1471-1541]
Lady/Empress Dowager Jiang

Major Works Cited:
Geiss, James. “The Cheng-te reign, 1506-1521” in The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 7: The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644, Part I.”

Great Ming:
Zhu Qizhen (Emperor Yingzong, the Zhengtong/Tianshun Emperor) [r. 1335-1449, 1457-1464]
Grand Empress Dowager Chen [d. 1442]
Wang Zhen, Eunuch Lord [d. 1449]

Mongol Tribes:
Esen, Taishi of the Oirat [d. 1455]

      <title>The Sea Shanty of Zheng He</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/theseashantyofzhenghe</link>
      <description>There once was a fleet that put to sea
All in name of the Imperial Ming
With phoenix sterns, &amp; dragon prows
Oh go, my baochuan, go!

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

Commanded by an admiral
So tall he seem unnatural
His voice rang out like temple bell
To get those treasures stowed

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

They sailed the southern seas so vast
They’d catch the wind with all nine masts
Astrologers would watch the skies
From Champa to Guangzhou

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

But on wave-crest a Pirate Lord
He spied the fleet and greedily roared
“Make ready all your cannon shot,
We’ll take all their cargo!”

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

Through flame and smoke they battled on
Til in a flash a month was gone
The Pirate Lord would taste defeat
His ships sunk deep below

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

At last they came to Indian shores
In search of spice and jewels and more
The deal was struck, with solemn vow
To pay all that was owed

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

But homeward bound the skies grew dim
The winds did howl, their fate seemed grim
The sailors prayed, “Help us, Tianfei!”
The masts began to glow

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor
To bring ceramics &amp; silk galore
One day, when the trading is done
They’ll take our spice &amp; go

The Goddess heard their earnest pleas
She stilled the waves &amp; calmed the breeze
The sailors gave their sober thanks
She’s spared them from their woe

Soon may the Treasure Fleet moor

      <description>In the wake of the Hongwu Emperor's death, his grandson - Zhu Yunwen - will assume command. He's been brought up and trained in the highest of Confucian ethics and morals, and will seek to curb the excesses of his dear grandfather's... more bloodthirsty policies. But not everyone is thrilled at the new leaf being turned in the book of the regime... especially those who stand to lose much more than they could possibly gain.

Mongke has ascended as the Great Khan of the Mongols and set loose his younger brother, Hulegu Ilkhan to bring the Islamic world to heel. The Caliph of the Abbasid Dynasty, al-Mustasim, sits ensconced in his citadel city of Baghdad - the jewel of Islam - and believes that Allah above and his loyal subjects beneath will be more than a match for barbarian hordes.

He's about to learn a lesson neither he - nor the world - will ever forget...

      <title>#208 - Ming 4: To Pick at the Dragon's Scales</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-208-ming4-topickatthedragonsscales</link>
      <description>To both the north and south, the armies of Great Ming continue to achieve order from chaos and stability across the realm, in the imperial palace at Nanjing, the Hongwu Emperor sits the Dragon Throne - as mercurial and temperamental as its very namesake... and woe betide anyone who stokes the dragon's wrath. Still, in the name of greater peace (and fewer mass slaughters), many a brave (and often fatally foolish)scholar will tempt fate by trying to tell Hongwu what he's doing wrong.

Time Period Covered:
1379-1389 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Ming:
The Hongwu Emperor (Zhu Yuanzhang) [r.1368-1398]
Duke Li Wenzhong [d. 1384]
General Fu Youde [d. 1394]
General Feng Sheng [?]
General Lan Yu [d. 1393]
General Mu Ying [d. 1392]
Scholar Chen Wenhui [d. 1381]
Scholar Li Shilu [d. 1381]
Scholar Xie Jin [1369-1415]

Yuan/Yunnanese:
Toghus Temür Khan [d. 1388]
Basalawarmi, the Prince of Liang [d. 1382]
General Naghachu [d. 1388]

      <title>#207 - Mongol 16: Assassin's Creed</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-207-mongol16-assassinscreed</link>
      <description>Following the destruction of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1221, the Mongol Empire's appetite for conquest to the west is whetted. It will take a few Great Khans to kick it off, but with the accession of Möngke to the throne in 1251, the way will be laid bare - to be led by his brother Hülegü Khan.
The only thing standing between him and the beating heart of Islam is a ragged band of heretics scattered across the mountain fortresses of northern Persia - a group known as the Nizari Isma'ili... or more infamously: the Assassins.

Time Period Covered:
765-1257 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Mongol Empire:
Möngke Khaghan [r. 1251-1259]
Hülegü Ilkhan [r. 1251-1265]
General Ket-Buqa (Noyan) [d. 1260]

Nizari Isma'ili:
Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq [702-765]
Hassan-i Sabbah [1050-1124]
Imam Jalal al-Din Hassan [1187-1221]
Imam Ala al-Din Muhammad III [1211-1255]
Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah [1230-1256]

Other:
Brother Matthew of Paris [1200-1259]
Friar William of Rubruck [1220-1293]
Ata-Malik Juvayni [1226-1283]
Rashid al-Din Hamadani [1247-1318]

      <title>#205 - Hangzhou: A City by the Bay</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-205-hangzhou-acitybythebay</link>
      <description>You might not be able to go on a real holiday - but today we take a little audio trip to the city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang... famed across the millennia for its beautiful bay, canals, and the famous West Lake.

This is no ordinary tourist get-away, though, because we'll be skipping across time, looking at the highlights of its early history.

Time Period Covered:
ca. 5,000 BCE- ca. 960 CE

Major Sources:
Cotterell, Arthur. The Imperial Capitals of China – An Inside View of the Celestial Empire.
Giles, Lionel (tr.) Sun Tzu’s The Art of War.
Loewe, Michael and Edward L. Shaughnessey. The Cambridge History of Ancient China.

      <title>#198 - Mongol 15.1: The Toluid Revolution</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-198-mongol15.1-thetoluidrevolution</link>
      <description>When Ögedei dies in late 1241, the empire must choose a successor before it can move forward. In spite of the late Khan determining in advance that it should be his grandson, his empress has other ideas - namely, installing her own irascible son, Güyük, instead. This raises more than a few eyebrows, especially from the Lord of the Golden Horde (and Güyük's personal nemesis) Batu Khan. He'll spend then next 5 years doing absolutely everything in his power to prevent Güyüks' enthronement. And so, when Güyük is finally installed... is it any surprise that he'll seek to get even on his hated cousin? Their looking showdown on the fields of Dzungaria will set the stage for a truly unpredictable series of events, that will leave the Mongol Empire altered forever...

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-193-yuan12-bluesky-redturban-whitelotus-blackdeath</link>
      <description>As Toghon Temur - the eleventh and final Great Khan of the Yuan, takes the throne - the dam holding back the near century of bad decisions back begins to buckle. Things are not helps by a dramatic climate shift, or the outbreak of one of the worst pandemics in human history, either... can we really blame the apocalyptic cults that spring up for thinking it's the end of the world?

Time Period Covered:
1333~1344 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Toghon Temur Khaghan [r. 1333-1368, 1370]
Grand Chancellor Bayan Ba'atur of the Merkid [1280-1340]
Zhu Yuanzhang [1328-1398]

      <description>In the aftermath of the Golden Horde's devastating strike into Eastern Europe, Christendom reels. As apocalyptic as the assaults were, the great enemy's sudden and inexplicable evaporation offers no comfort, and only more questions.

In order to get some answers, the Holy See will dispatch an unlikely candidate to make his way across the whole of Eurasia in an attempt to first find, and then meet with, the King of the Tartars - whoever, and wherever he may be...

Time Period Covered:
1245-1247 CE

Major Historical Figures:
European Christendom:
Pope Innocent IV [r. 1243-1254]
Friar Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (John of Plano Carpini) [ca. 1185-1252]
Friar Benedict of Poland [ca. 1200-ca. 1280]
Friar Stephen of Bohemia
Konrad I, High Duke of Krakow [ca. 1187-1247]
Prince Daniel Romanovich of Galacia [1201-1264]
Grand Prince Vasilko (Basil) Romanovich of Kiev [1203-1269]
Grand Prince Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich of Vladimir [1191-1246]

Mongol Empire:
Guyük Khaghan [r. 1246-1248]
Toregene Khatun [r. 1241-1246]
Batu Khan of the Golden Horde [ca. 1205-1255]
Grand Secretary Chinqai of Khwarazm

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-183-yuan6-culturalhot-potforthesoul</link>
      <description>Khubilai Khan is a man astride multiple worlds - trying to be both the Khan of the Great Mongol Nation, and the Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. This will take quite a bit of accommodation, and between Mongolian shamanism, Chinese Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, and Christianity... more than a little behaving like a cultural chameleon to square those civilizational circles.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-182-mongol-thegoldenhorde</link>
      <description>Jochi was tasked with subduing the Cuman tribes of the western steppes. Jochi failed. Now, under the second Great Khan Ögedei, it will fall to his successor, Batu, Khan of the Golden Horde, to finish what his father could not. He won't be going alone, though. In addition to his invincible tumens, he'll bring with him a host of imperial princes, as well as the greatest commander to ever mount a steed - Subotai the Valiant, now returns to the Western expanses to finish what he began 15 years ago...

4. Which Khan has got it goin' on?
5. Were there plagues in ancient China? How were they dealt with?
6. Did the Mongols trigger anti-foreign conservatism in the Ming?
7. Where should we divide "Chinese" history from "non-Chinese" history?
8. Just how incompetent was the Song Dynasty?
9. Why does THoC be like it do?
10. How did the Mongols relay orders over long distances before writing?
11. How much was opium to blame versus other factors in the decline and fall of the Qing Dynasty?

      <description>While his armies have been keeping busy in every direction on both offense and defense, Emperor Khubilai had been hard at work re-organizing the mess his family made in China and reformatting it into a stable, lawful Yuan Dynasty.

      <description>The people throughout China have been plunged into bitter suffering and tribulations since the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary government betrayed the fatherland, colluded with imperialists, and launched the counter-revolutionary war. Fortunately our People's Liberation Army, backed by the whole nation, has been fighting heroically and selflessly to defend the territorial sovereignty of our homeland, to protect the people's lives and property, to relieve the people of their sufferings, and to struggle for their rights, and it eventually wiped out the reactionary troops and overthrew the reactionary rule of the Nationalist government. 

Now, the People's War of Liberation has been basically won, and the majority of the people in the country have been liberated. On this foundation, the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference , composed of delegates of all the democratic parties and people's organization of China, the People's Liberation Army, the various regions and nationalities of the country, and the overseas Chinese and other patriotic elements, has been convened. Representing the will of the whole nation, [this session of the conference] has enacted the organic law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, elected Mao Zedong as chairman of the Central People's Government; and Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Song Qingling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, and Gao Gang as vice chairmen [of the Central People's Government]; and Chen Yi, He Long, Li Lisan, Lin Boqu, Ye Jianying, He Xiangning, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, Wu Yuzhang, Xu Xiangqian, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Seypidin, Rao Shushi, Tan Kah-kee [Chen Jiageng], Luo Ronghuan, Deng Zihui, Ulanhu, Xu Deli, Cai Chang, Liu Geping, Ma Yinchu, Chen Yun, Kang Sheng, Lin Feng, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Zhang Yunyi, Deng Xiaoping, Gao Chongmin, Shen Junru, Shen Yanbing, Chen Shutong, Szeto Mei-tong [Situ Meitang], Li Xijiu, Huang Yanpei, Cai Tingkai, Xi Zhongxun, Peng Zemin, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Li Zhuchen, Li Zhangda, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Yazi, Zhang Dongsun, and Long Yun as council members to form the Central People's Government Council, proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China and decided on Beijing as the capital of the People's Republic of China. 

The Central People's Government Council of the People's Republic of China took office today in the capital and unanimously made the following decisions: to proclaim the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China; to adopt the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the policy of the government; to elect Lin Boqu from among the council members as secretary general of the Central People's Government Council; to appoint Zhou Enlai as premier of the Government Adminstration Council of the Central People's Government and concurrently minister of Foreign Affairs, Mao Zedong as chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, Zhu De as commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army, Shen Junru as president of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, and Luo Ronghuan as procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, and to charge them with the task of the speedy formation of the various organs of the government to carry out the work of the government. 

At the same time, the Central People's Government Council decided to declare to the governments of all other countries that this government is the sole legal government representing all the people of the People's Republic of China. This government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government that is willing to observe the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Mao Zedong
Chairman

      <description>You know it’s hard out there for a prince. The fourth sons of a fourth son, Khubilai of the Borjigin will grow up little recognized, and bound for a life of little more than comfortable obscurity.

      <title>"Kubla Khan" - By: Samuel Taylor Coleridge</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/kublakhan-by-samueltaylorcoleridge</link>
      <description>Kubla Khan
BY SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE
Or, a vision in a dream. A Fragment.

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
   Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round;
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
   The shadow of the dome of pleasure
   Floated midway on the waves;
   Where was heard the mingled measure
   From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

   A damsel with a dulcimer
   In a vision once I saw:
   It was an Abyssinian maid
   And on her dulcimer she played,
   Singing of Mount Abora.
   Could I revive within me
   Her symphony and song,
   To such a deep delight ’twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread
For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise.

      <title>#164 - S. Song 7: Out With the New, In With the Old</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-s.song7-outwiththenew-inwiththeold</link>
      <description>Neo-Confucianism has made a strong comeback through the synthesis of its various doctrines under the philosophical guidance of Zhu Xi of the Southern Song court. He and his likeminded ministers seek to bring back the perfection of eras gone by by being perfectly morally upright, and expecting everyone else to do the same. But when it turns out that certain other loose-living party-boys like Chancellor Han Tuozhou and Emperor Ningzong aren’t so thrilled about their buzzkilling ways, it will set up a massive conflict at court.

Time Period Covered:
1194-1202 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Emperor Ningzong
Chancellor Han Tuohzou
Minister Zhu Xi

      <itunes:summary>Neo-Confucianism has made a strong comeback through the synthesis of its various doctrines under the philosophical guidance of Zhu Xi of the Southern Song court. He and his likeminded ministers seek to bring back the perfection of eras gone by by being perfectly morally upright, and expecting everyone else to do the same. But when it turns out that certain other loose-living party-boys like Chancellor Han Tuozhou and Emperor Ningzong aren’t so thrilled about their buzzkilling ways, it will set up a massive conflict at court.

Time Period Covered:
1194-1202 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Emperor Ningzong

      <title>#150 - N. Song 17: Smoke On the Water Margin</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-150-n.song17-smokeonthewatermargin</link>
      <description>Emperor Huizong’s Song Dynasty’s luck runs dry with a series of epic screw up that throw the whole system in disarray. War with the Tangut Xi Xia goes badly awry – and his generals won’t even tell him about it. And then rebellions start breaking out in the south – on by a millennialist death-cult led by a 12th century Jim Jones: Fang La… and another breaking out in the swamps and marshes of Liangshan, and led by Chinese Robin Hood of literary fame: Song Jiang. All of this will throw the Song military's carefully laid plans against the crumbling Khitan Liao into disarray, and make their would-be allies the Jurchen Jin wary of how reliable a partner the Chinese might actually be.

Time Period Covered: 1103-1123 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Emperor Huizong of Song (Zhao Ji) [r. 1100-1126]
Chancellor Cai Jing [1047-1126]
General Tong Guan, Commander of the Imperial Armies, eunuch [1054-1126]

Fang La, lacquer farmer-cum-millenialist death-cult leader and rebel commander, mad as hell and not going to take it anymore [d. 1121]

Song Jiang, Liangshan rebel commander, Leader Star of Destiny, “Timely Rain,” Haohan Hero [d. ca. 1123]

"Chapter/Poetry Music" "Spring River Flower Moon Night" 古筝 - 春江花月夜 - played on guzheng

      <description>The new Song Emperor, Zhenzong, sits uneasily on the Chinese throne after his father’s untimely death in 997. But court intrigues and attempted coups will only be the tip of the iceberg for this untested and unlikely sovereign, because the Liao Dynasty to the north has its eyes and hearts set on revenge for Chinese slights, and will send a massive force bent on crushing Song resistance to their will.

Emperor Taizong of Song (Zhao Jiong) [r. 976-997]

      <title>#135 - N. Song 3: A Lesser Empire</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-135-song3-alesserempire</link>
      <description>Song's second emperor, Taizong, wants to achieve the heights of Chinese glory, power, and territory just like the Tang and Han before him. But aspirations are easier than results, and he's going to have to contend with neighbor states on all sides far more powerful than his predecessors - and with his own position far weaker. Still it's either that or the utterly unthinkable: acknowledge that China is no longer the preeminent superpower of the East, but now just one state among equals.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-130-5d10k7-southbeforenorth</link>
      <description>With the rise of the last of the 5 Dynasties, Later Zhou, the North China Plains is able to go onto the offensive for the first time in decades; not against the endless expanses of the northern steppes, but a new strategy to reinvigorate the north by seizing the fertile and as of yet untouched reaches of the southern kingdoms, who are ripe for the plucking. Through it all, a brilliant military commander by the name of Zhao Kuangyin will prove his valor and skill, and is ultimately rewarded with a fateful governorship to the city of Song.

Time Period Covered:
954-959 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Later Zhou:
Chai/Guo Rong (Emperor Shizong) [r. 954-959]
Chancellor Wang Pu [d. 957]
General Zhao Kuangyin

Southern Tang:
Li Jing (Emperor Yuanzong) [r. 943-961]

      <title>#120 - Tang 32: A Thousand Cuts</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-120-tang32-athousandcuts</link>
      <description>The rebel-general and usurper-emperor Huang Chao will wear out his welcome in Chang’an, and meet his doom in the Valley of Tigers and Wolves… but his reign of terror over the capital will only be the first act of its terrible, drawn out fate – a fate that will mirror the Tang Dynasty’s as a whole. Emperor Xizong, already put to flight once, will return to the capital – only to swiftly find himself on the run yet again as China’s general and governors alike realize that they are no longer servants of the dynasty, but masters of their own domains… if they can hold them.

Time Period Covered:
882-888 CE (“The Era of Radiant Beginnings”)

Major Historical Figures:
Emperor Xizong of Tang (Li Yan) [r. 873-888]
Prince Li Jie (Emperor Zhaozong)
Chief Eunuch Tian Lingzi [d. 893]
Chen Jingxuan, Governor of Sichuan
General Zheng Tian, Commander of the Northwest
General Li Keyong, “The One-Eyed Dragon”, Khan of the Shatuo Turks

Huang Chao, Rebel Usurper [d. 884]

Governor-General Zhu Mei, Rebel Warlord, would-be-usurper [d. 887]
Li Yun, Prince of Xiang, would-be-puppet-monarch [d. 887]

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-119-tang31-reapthewhirlwind-</link>
      <description>The poison seeds that have been planted across China for the last century and longer will all begin to sprout, as the rebel commander Huang Chao takes command of the latest and greatest of internal threats to imperial stability. Yet it won't be the rebels themselves that will prove the decisive factor in the chaos to come... but instead the Empire's own supposedly "loyal" generals and soldiers... already looking ahead to their own places in the post-Tang world.
Time Period Covered:
878-882 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Tang Dynasty:
Emperor Xizong of Tang (Li Yan/Xuan) [r. 874-888]
General Zhang Zimian
Governor-General Li Tiao of Guangdong [d. 879]
General Gao Pian, "The General Who Lost the North"

Xi Dynasty:
Huang Chao, "The Heaven-Storming General" [d. 884]

      <title>#118 - Tang 30: Sow the Wind</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-118-tang30-sowthewind</link>
      <description>Dear empire, we’re having a very mild case of severe rebellion, um, everywhere. But don’t worry, it’s totally under control. Everything’s fine, we’ve got this. Don’t panic. PS, rebel leaders if you’re reading this we’ll give you more than you’ve ever dreamed of if you’ll just stop attacking us, pretty please. But no it’s fine, we’re totally going to win, for sure. PPS, Imperial Army please stop refusing to fight. We’re totally serious about this. Joke’s over, it’s not funny anymore. Fight the rebels or we’re going to be, like, super angry with you. Victory is assured. No problem whatsoever. PPS, local magistrates, please recruit your peasants to fight the rebels – promise them whatever you have to. Seriously, anything. Long live the victorious Tang. No, the plane engines only look like they’re on fire. They’re supposed to look like that. That’s completely normal. 
Love, Emperor Xizong.

Time Period Covered:
873-878 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Tang Dynasty:
Emperor Yizong of Tang [d. 873]

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-116-tang28-i-xuanzong</link>
      <description>Li Yi was never trained to be emperor. Not only was he the thirteenth son of Xianzong, but he'd been ruthlessly mocked and belittled his whole life by his entire family for being an idiot, an invalid, and a mute. But when his hated nephew dies in 846, he's going to shock the world by revealing he was faking it the whole time, and go on to become the last good emperor of the Tang before its final bow.

      <description>The new Emperor Wuzong will have a lot on his plate right from the get-go. Foreign threats and domestic squabbles will frame his early reign, but it's his own fanatical devotion to Daoism and antipathy to Buddhism that will define his reign.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-113-tang25-thelongshoremansprophecy</link>
      <description>In the wake of Emperor Xianzong’s unexpected death in 820, his work remains unfinished… and now left in the hands of his incapable, incompetent successors. The eunuchs are hard at work securing ultimate authority for themselves, and have no time for a strong central leader, and the Governor-generals of the northeast are eager to get out from under the imperial thumb once again. Into all this madness, a dock-worker, a fortuneteller, and an army of vagabonds will make a quixotic bid for the throne.

Time Period Covered:
February, 820- January, 827 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Emperor Muzong of Tang (Li Heng) [r. 820-824]
Emperor Jingzong of Tang (Li Zhan) [r. 824-827]
Emperor Wenzong of Tang (Li Ang) [r. 827-840]
Prince Li Han of Jiang [d. 827]
Eunuch-Official Liang Shoujian
Eunuch Official Liu Keming [d. 827]
Chief Minister Xiao Mian
Su Xuanming, Fortuneteller Extraordinaire [d. 824]
Zhang Shao, Unlikely Sitter of Thrones [d. 824]

      <title>#106 - Tang 19: Not Quiet on the Western Front</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-106-tang19-notquietonthewesternfront</link>
      <description>You would think that finally quelling the largest rebellion on Earth would by the realm back into peaceful harmony. Unfortunately for the Tang, you’d be wrong. While China was forced to spend every waking moment in the Northeast desperately trying to drive back An Lushan for the past 7 years, the Tibetans went ahead and moved in from the West, cutting off Chinese access to the Far West Protectorate, and by 763 poised to deliver a devastating broadside to the already-devastated Tang Empire. And as if that’s not enough, in the middle of all this, a loyal military commander has false accusations of treason leveled against him by a paranoid regional official, but then through a series of zany happenstances is forced to actually rebel against the government for fear of being convicted and killed for the initial false charges. This is why we can’t have nice things…

Time Period Covered:
763~770 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Tang Empire:
Emperor Daizong of Tang (Li Yu) [r. 762-779]

General Pugu Huai’en [d. 765]
Luo Fengxian, Imperial Eunuch Official
Xin Yunjing, Governor of Hedong
Yu Chao’en, Commander of the Army of Divine Strategy [d. 770]

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-103-anshi3-strangebedfellows</link>
      <description>Reeling from the loss of both capital cities to the rebel army, Emperor Xuanzong and his heir Li Heng split up.

Newly enthroned, Suzong will be forced to cobble together an unlikely coalition of China’s neighbors in order to have any hope of turning the tide of the civil war that threatens to drown the Tang Dynasty in blood. Arabs, Transoxianans, Ferghanans, and even Uyghur Stepperiders will join forces with a corps of Han Chinese soldiers willing to die to the last man if it means stopping An Lushan and his Yan rebel army in its tracks.

      <itunes:summary>Reeling from the loss of both capital cities to the rebel army, Emperor Xuanzong and his heir Li Heng split up. Three days later from the northern garrison at Lingwu, the Crowned Prince declares himself the new emperor, Suzong – surprise, Dad! Newly enthroned, Suzong will be forced to cobble together an unlikely coalition of China’s neighbors in order to have any hope of turning the tide of the civil war that threatens to drown the Tang Dynasty in blood. Arabs, Transoxianans, Ferghanans, and even Uyghur Stepperiders will join forces with a corps of Han Chinese soldiers willing to die to the last man if it means stopping An Lushan and his Yan rebel army in its tracks.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-101-anshi1-heart-belly-claws-teeth</link>
      <description>The aged Emperor Xuanzong of Tang rest uneasily on his throne as 751 brings not just the sting of defeat at Talas, but also to the far south and northeast. He and his chancellor will become increasingly reliant on the Governor-General of Dongan Protectorate, the Sogdian-Turk An Lushan. But at a time when loyalty, ethnicity, and what it means to be Chinese is increasingly strained, how much pressure can the system take before it snaps?

Time Period Covered:
751-755 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Li Longji (Emperor Xuanzong of Tang)
Chancellor Li Linfu (d. 753)
Chancellor Yang Guozhong
Consort Yang Huiyuan
Crowned Prince Li Heng
An Lushan, Governor-General of the Andong Protectorate
Geshu Han, Governor-General of the Anbei Protectorate
An Qingzong (Gen. An’s eldest son and heir)

      <description>Title Meaning: “Hundredth!” It’s a Q&amp;A between you listeners and myself on topics far and wide! They range from yet further exploration of Empress Wu, to the nature of Chinese alcohol, my favorite Chinese movies, Chinese classes and slavery within the Empire and even today, China’s relations with Southeast Asia and why it seems to be a particularly difficult place to conquer across time, the end of the Ming Dynasty, the surprisingly contentious history of silk, and finally a question likely to land me in hot water: a question on how China might change in the century to come (bring it on, Fifty Cent Party!)

      <title>#98 - Tang 16: All Along the Watchtowers</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-98-tang16-allalongthewatchtowers</link>
      <description>We leave the capital behind to take a tour of the Tang Empire’s neighbors, both old and new. A tenuous peace with Tibet leads to a westward push putting the Chinese into contact – and eventual conflict – with the Islamic Abbasid Caliphate. Meanwhile, to the north and east rebellious Khitan tribesmen will spark a huge military buildup in the region under the control of one man, while the former Goguryeo reorganizes itself into the powerful state of Balhae, forcing the Tang Court to re-assess its diplomatic options.

Time Period Covered:
730-750 CE

Major Historical Figures:
Tang Dynasty:
Li Longji (Emperor Xuanzong of Tang) [r. 712-756]
Gen. Zhang Shougui, Military Governor of Fanyang
Gen. An Lushan, Military Governor of Pinglu, Prince of Dongping

Tibetan Kingdom:
Turgesh Kaghanate:
Sulu Kaghan [d. 738]

Abbasid Islamic Caliphate:
Second Turkic Kaghanate:
Bilgé Kaghan [r. 716-734]
Kul Tigin [d. 731]

Khitan and Xi Tribes:
Ketuyu [d. 733]

Balhae Kingdom:
King Go [r. 698-719]
King Mu [r. 719-737]
King Mun [r. 737-793]

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-96-tang14-thesacrificesoffengandshan</link>
      <description>Military reforms mark our entrance into Xuanzong’s early-middle reign, which is more or less a basket of unicorn foals: external peace, internal stability… now if only that darned economy would fix itself! But the emperor will turn a fateful corner in the 724, when his official Zhang Yue convinces him to conduct the Feng and Shan Sacrifices: the highest ritual a Chinese ruler could conduct – a sacrifice to Heaven and Earth atop holy Mount Tai.

Time Period Covered:
714 – 726 CE

Important Historical Figures:
Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (Li Longji) [r. 714- ]
Empress Wang [d. 724]

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-95-tang13-xuanzongcanfixit-</link>
      <description>Wu Zetian’s grandson Li Longji (aka Xuanzong of Tang) is left to pick up the pieces of 50+ years’ worth of overindulgence, royal excess, and the rampant deconstruction of the entire imperial bureaucratic apparatus. Thanks, grandma. Fortunately, he’ll prove uniquely suited to the role of maintenance-man, and under his unexpectedly capable leadership, he’ll reign in his family members, do away with the thousands of excess positions, reform the government, and stabilize the regime. He’s building up to a second Golden Age for the Tang Dynasty… all he has to do is get his obnoxious Aunt Taiping out of the way first…

Major Historical Figures:
Li Longji (Emperor Xuanzong of Tang) [r. 712-756]
Princess Taiping [d. 713]
Li Dan (Retired Emperor Ruizong) [r. 710-712, d. 716]

      <title>#94 - Tang 12: Two Second Reigns</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-94-tang12-twosecondreigns</link>
      <description>The Tang Dynasty has been restored following Empress Wu's eldest son's coup d'etat. But dynastic restoration does not equate to societal reformation, and many of the problems Wu inherited or exacerbated remain. Throw into that mix a decade long period of palatial infighting between princes and princesses, and we have a period so chalk full of intrigue, espionage, and assassination... that classical historians have preferred to steer around this decade rather than even deign to acknowledge it.

Time Period Covered:
705-712 CE

Notable Historical Figures:
Deposed Empress Wu Zetian [d. 705]
Li Xian (Emperor Zhongzong of Tang) [2nd r. 705-710]
Li Dan (Emperor Ruizong of Tang) [2nd r. 710-712]

      <title>#91 - Tang 9: Reign of Terror</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-91-tang9-reignofterror</link>
      <description>With her husband dead, Empress Wu is unrivaled in Chang'an, but that situation is tenuous as she has no legal basis for that power. Her eldest (surviving) son will take up the throne as Emperor Zhongzong for... all of two months before she decides he's got to go. Her timid, youngest son will fit her style much better as Ruizong, but when the high lords of the realm are exposed as conspiring against her, she will unleash her full fury on their ranks, employing tactics and methods that will decimate the literati class.

Time Period Covered:
683-686 CE

Empress Dowager Wu Zhao

Li Dan (Emperor Ruizong) [r. 684-689]

      <title>#89 - Tang 8: Clash on the Borderlands</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-89-tang8-clashontheborderlands</link>
      <description>Tang China goes to town on its neighbors over the course of the mid-7th century. First, the Western Regions of central Asia will feel the full force of a reunited Middle Kingdom, culminating in the collapse and Chinese annexation of the whole Western Turkic Khannate, putting Chinese borders (briefly) right up against Persia. Then, Emperor Gaozong will commit himself to completing what his father begun: the final destruction of Goguryeo. but this time he'll enlist the aid of South Korean Silla to carve out a toehold on the peninsula to give himself a better shot at success. But when a Japanese war-fleet responds to North Korean pleas for aid, it will be a showdown on the high seas for which Asian power will control the Korean Peninsula. 

Time Period Covered: 
649-673 CE

Emperor Gaozong (Li Zhi)

      <title>#88 - Tang 7: Empress Wu Behind The Curtain</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-88-tang-7-empress-wu-behind-the-curtain</link>
      <description>The more than two-decade period following Wu Zhao’s ascension as Emperor Gaozong’s empress-consort will serve to point out three things: how weak the emperor is, how powerful Empress Wu has become, and how there is absolutely nothing she won’t do to keep it that way. By the middle of the episode, she’ll be considered even at the time the co-equal ruler of her husband, on of the so-called “Two Holy Ones.” But power is a slippery fish to hang on to… especially when you have no legal means of maintaining it, and several sons just waiting in the wing to snatch it all away.Time Period Covered:656-683 CEMajor Historical Figures:Emperor Gaozong of Tang (Li Zhi) [r. 649-683]Empress Consort Wu Zhao Crowned Prince Li Hong (Emperor Xiaojing [posthumous title]) [652-675]Crowned Prince Li Xián [653-684]Crowned Prince Li Xiǎn (Emperor Zhongzong) [b. 656- , r. 684]Li Zhong, Prince of Liang [d.665]Chancellor Zhangsun Wuji [d. 665]Chancellor Shangguan Yi [d. 665]Chancellor Xu Jingzong [retired 670, d. 673]Major Sources:Dash, Mike. “The Demonization of Empress Wu” in The Smithsonian. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-demonization-of-empress-wu-20743091/?no-istJiang, Chen An.

      <description>Li Shimin assassinated his two brothers and put his father out to pasture in order to snag the top job as Emperor Taizong. But a mere three weeks into his reign, this “rock star” monarch will face an existential challenge to his reign and the future of the Tang Dynasty as a whole: the wrath of the Göktürk Khaganate. It will prove to be a wild ride to determine whether Tang China will be doomed to remain a vassal of the Turks, or whether Taizong’s “true vision” will prove enough to rise to the challenge.Time Period Covered:626-630 CEMajor Historical Figures:Tang:Prince Li Shimin [Emperor Taizong]Retired Emperor GaozuGöktürk Khaganate:Illig KhaganTölis KhanLiang Dynasty (Turkic Vassal):Emperor Liang Shidu (d. 628)Xueyantuo Tribe (alt.

      <description>With its push against Goguryeo rather catastrophically stalled out, the whole enterprise begins to unravel with spectacular speed for the Sui Dynasty. All the while, its Emperor Yang will maintain a disturbingly unaffected demeanor for the suffering his edicts are creating across the countryside - in large part because his lackeys have created a "reality-distortion filter" around him they'll literally kill to maintain.But elsewhere, agents of insurrection will rise to challenge the waning star that is Sui China, especially in the form of one Li Yuan, the Duke of Tang and his family.Time Period Covered:614-618 CEMajor Historical Figures:SuiEmperor Yang of SuiEmpress Xiao Prince Yang You (Emperor Gong)Prince Yang Hao, Prince of QinGeneral Yuwen HuajiRebel Tang ForcesLi Yuan, Duke of TangLi ShiminLady Li/ Pingyang, Commander of the Woman's ArmyGokturk KhannateShibi KhanWorks CitedSima, Guang.

      <description>Emperor Yang of Sui has ventured forth to the far northeastern border of China in an attempt to rescue his honor from the clutches of the impudent King of Goguryeo, Yeongyang. Little does King Yeongyang know that the Sui Empire has secretly begun construction on a new waterway even more navigable that the first dreaded Grand Canal. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small kingdom of Koreans struggling to resist a renewed Chinese domination of East Asia…

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-79-sui-3-yang-s-imperial-tour</link>
      <description>The second emperor of the Sui Dynasty gets bad rap - his postmortem regnal name means "the Slothful" and he's commonly lumped together with the rest of the "bad-last emperors" as being hedonistic, wasteful, and just generally monstrous. But is this really the case, or was Emperor Yang the victim of a historical hatchet job?Today we look at the upbringing and early life of Prince Yang Guang, his unlikely rise to power, and then the early period of his reign over China as Emperor Yang, and how he picked up where his father had left off in trying to reignite the glory of the ancient Han.Time Period Covered:605-609 CEImportant Figures:SuiYang Jian (Emperor Wen of Sui) [d. 605]Empress Dugu [d. 602]Yang Guang (Emperor Yang of Sui) [r. 605-618]Empress XiaoGeneral Yang "Axe Man" SuIntelligence Chief Pei JuJapanPrince Shotoku [Sovereign of Nihon]Gökturk KhannateQimin Khan [alt.

      <description>Emperor Wen of Sui is potentially the most important monarch you've never heard of. For him, militarily reuniting China wasn't his legacy - it was his prelude. Both pre- and post-reunification, we explore the internal facets of his truly impressive reign today: his origins, personality, outlook, confidantes, the existential problems he inherited from the Period of Disunion, and the novel, world-changing solutions he'd craft to ensure China's reunification would be factual, rather than just rhetorical.Time Period Covered:581-600 CEMajor FiguresYang Jing (Emperor Wen of Sui)[r. 581-604]Empress Dugu QieluoGao JiangYang SuSu WeiLi DelinArthur F.

      <description>Northern Zhou seems to have plotted a course for ultimate victory in the contest between the Northern and Southern Dynasties, having already annexed Northern Qi and turned its sights on Chen to the south. But it’s amazing how quickly dynastic fortunes can reverse themselves, and the Yuwen Clan’s line of emperors find itself stopped short, destroyed not by external threat but from an enemy within: the Duke of Sui, the man who would be Emperor of all China.Time Period Covered:577-589 CEMajor Figures:Northern Zhou:Yuwen Yan (Emperor Xuan; “The Responsible”) [r. 577-578, as Retired Emperor Tianyuan; “The Heavenly and Fundamental” r. 578-580]Yuwen Chan (Emperor Jing; “The Silent”) [r. 578-581]Gen. Yuchi Jiong [d. 580]Gen. Yin ShouSui:Duke Yang Jiang of Sui (Emperor Wen; “The Cultured”) [regent of Northern Zhou 580-581, Emperor of Sui r. 581-604]Chen:Chen Xu (Emperor Xuan; “The Responsible”) [r. 569-582]Chen Shubao (Houzhu; “Final Ruler”) [r. 582-589]Western Liang (vassal of Northern Zhou/Sui):Xiao Cong (Emperor Jing; “The Meek”) [r. 585-587]

      <title>#74 - S&amp;N 18- The Fall Of Northern Qi</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-74-s-n-18-the-fall-of-northern-qi</link>
      <description>In the Northeast of China, Northern Qi just can’t catch a break. First it was Emperor Wenxuan’s murderous paranoia, and now it will be subjected to Wucheng’s indolent hedonism, “immoral games,” and general excesses… and then the penultimate Qi emperor, Houzhi, will decide that the state treasury is his own personal piggy-bank and startin singing “Hakuna Matata” while the state burns.Meanwhile to the West, Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou will finally break out of his uncle Yuwen Hu’s shadow – by shattering his skull – and then begin eying the swiftly foundering Northern Qi debacle hungrily, eager to reunite the North after almost a half-century of seperation. By episode’s end, it will be a climactic showdown between the two powerful states: one waxing, one waning… which will emerge victorious?Time Period Covered:561-578 CENotable Figures:Northern Qi:Emperor/Retired Emperor Wucheng (Gao Dan) [r. 561-565, d. 569]Empress Hu [565-572]Prime Minister He Shikai [524-571]Zu Ting [550-577]Emperor Houzhu (Gao Wei) [r. 565-578]Gao Heng (Youzhu) [570-577]Northern Zhou:Emperor Wu (Yuwen Yong) [r. 560-578]Emperor Xuan (Yuwen Yun) [r. 579-582]Yang Lihua (Crowned Princess/Empress of Zhou) [r. 579-582]Prime Minister Yuwen Hu [513-572]Yang Jian, Duke of Sui [541- ]Göturk Khannate:Muqan Khagan (Ashina Yando) [554-572]Empress Ashina [551-582]

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-73-s-n-17-the-only-tear-shed-for-wenxuan</link>
      <description>Today’s episode takes us through the turmoil within northern China and beyond over the 550s. We begin looking outside of China proper as the rulers of the Rouran Steppe Confederacy are overthrown and replaced by the vassal-turned-enemy the Göktürks, and briefly touch on the Khitan Tribe of Manchuria. We then go through the reign of Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi, who will initially lead his newfound dynasty to power and prominence before his mounting madness will plunge it into chaos and terror.Time Period Covered550-561 CENotable FiguresAshina Bumin/Tumen (Illig Khagan of Göktürk) [r. 550]Issik Khagan of East GokturkIstemi Khagan of West GokturkGeneral Gao Huan (Warlord of Eastern Wei) (d. 550)Gao Yang (Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi) [r. 551-560]Crowned Prince Gao Yin (Emperor Fei of Northern Qi) [r. 560]Gao Yan, Prince of Chanshan (Emperor Xiaozhao of Northern Qi) [r. 560-561]Prime Minister Yang Yin [d. 560]Works CitedThe History of the Northern Dynasties (Bei Shi) – Li Dashi and Li YanshouThe Zizhi Tongjian – Sima GuangEarly Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 AD) Pt. 1 &amp; 2 – John Lagerway and Lü Pengzhi

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/supplemental-biopic-the-mathematician-of-heaven</link>
      <description>This short episode covers the life of one of the great mathematicians, astronomers, and engineers of ancient China: Zu Chongzhi. In his life from 429-500 CE, he will re-create an ancient precursor to the compass that had been lost for centuries, calculate the motions of the celestial objects with a degree of accuracy in excess of 99.9%, design a comprehensive new calendar system, and derive the value of π to a degree of accuracy that would not be surpassed the world over for another millennium.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-71-s-n-15-the-crowded-hour</link>

Following the split between Eastern and Western Wei in the North, it seems like there’s might be peace and quiet in the South for once. But this will prove short-lived, indeed. First, Vietnam will rise up in it first major rebellion in centuries against Chinese hegemony, and then a general from the far north will go rogue, defect from his warlord, and offer up his territories to Liang.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-59-s-n-3-buddhist-blades-daoist-flames</link>

That would run into direct conflict with China's own home-grown religion: Daoism. As the two co-mingled, some would accept both... but others, especially in Northern Wei, would use all the might to eradicate what they deemed to be a heretical foreign influence on their Chinese culture.

      <title>#35 - E. Han 2: Reclamation</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-35-e-han-2-reclamation</link>
      <description>It is a Golden Age for the Eastern Han.  After decades of tumult, famine, and civil war, the Chinese Empire is poised once again to reclaim its status as preeminent East Asian power.  Retaking the abandoned Western Vassal Kingdoms, sending envoys to India and even Rome, and at long last finishing the 200 year old war with the rapidly disintegrating Xiongnu Empire to the north.

      <description>In the power vacuum left by the defeated Xin Dynasty's collapse,  no fewer than six claimants to the long-vacant Throne of Han will vie for power... one backed by the Lülin Rebels, another by the Red Eyebrow Army, another a northern lord with an axe to grind, and a fortune-teller playing the role of a lifetime... who will emerge victorious to reunify the fractious Chinese Empire?

The first choice will die without ever having tasted real power, the second an incompetent buffoon who won't last a month in office, until finally a real alternative can be found from the most unlikely of places: prison.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-17-e-zhou-6-qin-s-reformation-and-ascension</link>
      <description>A brief synopsis of Tomb Sweeping Festival, it's traditions and expectations... then onto the state of Qin's early defeats at the hands of a combined Wei and Han. It's Qin's subsequent reforms at the hand of the Legalist Shang Yang,however, that are the real focus of this episode.  Newly centralized and militarized, the now Kingdom of Qin begins it it's expansion, beginning with the independent realms of Sichuan.  And for his efforts, Shang Yang will find himself pulled apart by chariots, and his family annihilated.  Some thanks, indeed. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.

But the major event that would shape the conflict to come is the civil war that would destroy the pre-eminent power of the 6th century BCE Zhou Empire, and result in the total breakup of the State of Jin into three of the seven soon-to-be warring states: Han, Wei, and Zhao.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-12-e-zhou-1-the-shattered-empire</link>
      <description>King You of Zhou lays headless, the capital a smouldering ruin, and royal authority utterly destroyed. Regional lords exploit the chaos at hand to expand their own domains - and at times declare their own kingdoms - while the new, toothless Eastern Zhou kings struggle to stabilize the situation. After a holiday break, we're right back into the action with the beginnings of the Spring and Autumn Period.

By the end of the episode, though a Zhou king will remain on the throne, we've seen the end (for now) of a unified state in anything but name...

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-9-w-zhou-1-heaven-does-not-make-propositions</link>
      <description>The self-proclaimed Kung Wu of Zhou stands triumphant amid the smoking ruins of the Shang Dynasty... but though the war is over, victory is far from assured. With his premature death, his unready heir will prompt rebellion against the fledgling Zhou Dynasty - not only by the Shang remnant, but also his own uncles! To cement their hold on power, the Zhou will be forced to construct a new standard of legitimacy: The Mandate of Heaven.

      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-8-shang-3-the-shang-vanquished</link>
      <description>This episode we chronicle the decline and eventual fall of the once-glorious Shang Dynasty to the same vices and evils that spelled doom for the Xia centuries ago. In the West, a powerful new clan calling itself the Zhou has risen to power, eventually with an eye to make right what the final Shang Kings have twisted so horribly wrong. Along the way, we'll colonize the Japanese islands and raise a minor Chinese prince to the King of Korea.

      <title>#3 - Xia 1: The Xia, China's First Dynasty</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-3-xia-1-the-xia-china-s-first-dynasty</link>
      <description>This week we move into the beginnings of China’s dynastic period where rulers began favoring birthright over merit – and the consequences will be almost immediately apparent. Beginning with the triumphant reign of the heroic Yu the Great, the Xia’s semi-accidental trip into dynastic succession will swiftly spiral downward, eventually leaving a usurping general in power, and the House of Xia all but exterminated after decades in exile. Rebooted as of 09/06/2016

      <title>#2 - Origins 2: Five Emperors, Twelve Islands</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-2-origins-2-five-emperors-twelve-islands</link>
      <description>This episode, we enter the second half of our gaze into the Chinese origins mythos. Focusing on the Five Emperors descended from the Yellow Emperor, this period marks the beginning of the transformation of the Huaxia People from settled tribe, to dynastic feudal kingdom. There will be betrayal, cataclysmic flooding, bird kingdoms, the Vietnamese, magical earth, and – of course – dragons.

UPDATE: as of 08/28/2016, this episode has been fully rebooted from the ground up. Enjoy!

      <title>#1 - Origins 1: The Mythical Origins Of The Middle Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://shows.acast.com/thehistoryofchina/episodes/-1-origins-1-the-mythical-origins-of-the-middle-kingdom</link>
      <description>In episode 1, we begin with an introduction to this podcast, followed by a brief overview of what we’ve come to know about early human migration and settlement in the region that will eventually become China. Finally, we’ll delve into the mythological origin story that purports to tell of the three divine Sovereigns who would create and then rule over the Han people. I’m very excited to be getting this journey underway! Once again welcome, and thank you for listening. UPDATE: As of 08/28/2016, this episode has been completely rebooted from the ground-up. Enjoy!
