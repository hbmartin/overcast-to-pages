    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conversation this week is with <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/gian-marco-iodice-3183a9a1/'>Gian Marco</a>. Gian is a tech lead in the machine learning group at ARM and the author of the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Cookbook-artificial-intelligence-ultra-low-power/dp/180181497X'>TinyML Cookbook</a> published in April of 2022. At <a href='https://www.arm.com/'>ARM</a> Gian looks after the ML performance optimizations for the arm compute library, which he co-created in 2017 to get the best performance on ARM Cortex-A CPUs. ARM Compute Library is currently the most performant library for machine learning on ARM. And it&apos;s deployed on billions of devices worldwide from servers to smartphones. Gian holds an MSC with honors in Electronic Engineering from the University of Pisa in Italy and has several years of experience developing machine learning and computer vision algorithms on edge devices.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/schneiderjoseph/'>Joe Schnieder</a> for taking the time to chat with me on his history of applying AI using Embedded Systems. As a fellow entrepreneur, educator to the community, <a href='https://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a> enthusiast, and someone looking at how to apply AI at the edge, this was an awesome conversation.<br/><br/>From his early times at <a href='https://www.deere.com/en/index.html'>John Deere</a> to his current role as the founder of <a href='https://dojofive.com/'>Dojo5</a>, Joe brings passion, inspiration, and in some ways a much-needed levelheadedness ( is that a word? ) to the industry.<br/><br/>By giving back with his presentations and learnings are well worth attending. I hope that through this podcast you are able to learn about some of the new areas in which AI is being pushed to the edge with smarter devices being able to <b>interact</b> and then <b>react</b> using data from sensors in real-time.<br/><br/>Finally, if you are interested in learning about applying AI, be sure to join us at a future Applied AI Monthly meetup and help support us so we can make future Emerging Technologies North non-profit events!<br/><br/></p><ul><li><a href='https://www.emtechnorth.org/'>Emerging Technologies North</a></li><li><a href='https://www.meetup.com/applied_ai/'>AppliedAI Meetup</a></li></ul><p>Here&apos;s just a few of the many fun and interesting topics discussed during this podcast:<br/><br/></p><ul><li><a href='https://www.meetup.com/applied_ai/'>Applied AI Meetup</a></li><li><a href='https://www.radioshack.com/collections/electronics-kits-projects'>Radio Shack Kits</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B'>Turbo C++</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture'>Precision Agriculture</a></li><li><a href='https://www.imbio.com/'>Imbio</a></li><li><a href='https://www.agfuse.io/'>AgFuse</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)'>Skynet</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience'>Semtience</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface'>Brain-computer Interface</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs'>Devs</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg'>Borg</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL'>Cobol</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system'>Embedded Systems</a></li><li><a href='https://www.particle.io/solutions/iot-asset-tracking/'>Particle Asset Tracker</a></li><li><a href='https://embedded.fm/'>EmbeddedFM</a></li><li><a href='https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Learning-TensorFlow-Ultra-Low-Power-Microcontrollers/dp/1492052043'>TinyML</a></li><li><a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/topher_white_what_can_save_the_rainforest_your_used_cell_phone?language=en'>Topher White</a></li><li><a href='https://rfcx.org/'>Rainforest Connection</a></li><li><a href='https://www.boonlogic.com/'>Boon Logic</a></li><li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utuz7wBGjKM'>OpenAI Model Generates Python Code</a></li><li><a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/lite'>Tensorflow Lite</a></li><li><a href='https://www.eventbrite.com/o/dojo-five-30172525502'>Dojo5 Learnings</a></li></ul><p>Enjoy!<br/>Your host,<br/><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/justingrammens/'>Justin Grammens<br/></a><br/></p>]]></content:encoded>
