      <title>The Decade of May 15-22, 2025: Google's 50X AI Growth &amp; Transformation with Logan Kilpatrick</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>Logan Kilpatrick from Google DeepMind returns for his fifth appearance to discuss Google’s transformation from "sleeping giant" to AI powerhouse, sharing insights from his year at the company as AI usage grew 50 times to 500 trillion tokens per month. He examines Google’s strengths, including superior compute infrastructure, frontier models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, viral products like NotebookLM, and the deepest AI research talent in the industry. The conversation covers whether leading AI companies will become more similar or different as easy opportunities disappear, why startups still have unique chances, and the potential impact of Google’s ultra-fast diffusion language models. Logan also shares practical advice for joining early access programs and getting noticed by industry insiders, including his personal email and an open invitation to reach out.

      <title>a16z on Protecting Little Tech: The Techno-Optimist AI Policy Agenda with Matt Perault, Head of AI Policy</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, Matt Perault, Head of AI Policy at a16z, discusses their approach to AI regulation focused on protecting "little tech" startups from regulatory capture that could entrench big tech incumbents. The conversation covers a16z's core principle of regulating harmful AI use rather than the development process, exploring key policy initiatives like the Raise Act and California's SB 813. Perault addresses critical challenges including setting appropriate regulatory thresholds, transparency requirements, and designing dynamic frameworks that balance innovation with safety. The discussion examines both areas of agreement and disagreement within the AI policy landscape, particularly around scaling laws, regulatory timing, and the concentration of AI capabilities.

      <title>Don't Make Mirror Life: Synthetic Biologist Kate Adamala on Risks &amp; Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode of The Cognitive Revolution, University of Minnesota Professor of Genetics and Synthetic Biologist, Kate Adamala, offers insights into synthetic biology and its potential implications for humanity. The discussion begins with an overview of synthetic biology and its goal to expand the chemical repertoire of life. Adamala delves into 'mirror life'—biological systems made of mirror-image molecules—and the significant risks they pose. She highlights parallels to AI safety concerns and emphasizes the importance of containing groundbreaking technologies to avoid unintended consequences. Adamala recounts her journey from advocating for mirror life to leading an effort to prevent its development, stressing the need for responsible innovation. The episode concludes with reflections on maximizing benefits while minimizing risks in both synthetic biology and AI.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of The Cognitive Revolution, University of Minnesota Professor of Genetics and Synthetic Biologist, Kate Adamala, offers insights into synthetic biology and its potential implications for humanity. The discussion begins with an overview of synthetic biology and its goal to expand the chemical repertoire of life. Adamala delves into 'mirror life'—biological systems made of mirror-image molecules—and the significant risks they pose. She highlights parallels to AI safety concerns and emphasizes the importance of containing groundbreaking technologies to avoid unintended consequences. Adamala recounts her journey from advocating for mirror life to leading an effort to prevent its development, stressing the need for responsible innovation. The episode concludes with reflections on maximizing benefits while minimizing risks in both synthetic biology and AI.</p>

      <title>What did Google's AI Co-Scientist "Discover"?  The Human Scientists' POV, from the Podovirus podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>We're following up on our recent episode on Google's AI Co-Scientist with a special crossover episode from the Podovirus podcast. Hosts Dr Jessica Sacher and Dr Joe Campbell speak with José Penadés and Tiago Costa, scientists at Imperial College London who made a surprising discovery that Google's AI Co-Scientist later put forward as a hypothesis entirely on its own.

The episode explores the fascinating world of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) - DNA sequences that hijack virus reproduction to spread themselves as a bacterial defense mechanism. The key mystery was how capsid-forming PICIs, which only encode virus heads without tails, managed to spread across different bacteria. The surprising answer, which eluded human scientists for years but which Google's AI Co-Scientist discovered through literature analysis, is that these capsids evolved to connect with various virus tails in the environment.

This episode demonstrates how AI can now contribute to frontier scientific research beyond just grunt work - providing unbiased perspectives and key insights that accelerate discovery. It's a vivid example of science fiction becoming reality in our lifetimes.

      <title>AI Control: Using Untrusted Systems Safely with Buck Shlegeris of Redwood Research, from the 80,000 Hours Podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, we share a fascinating conversation from the 80,000 Hours Podcast between Rob Wiblin and Buck Shlegeris, CEO of Redwood Research. Buck dives deep into the emerging field of AI Control strategies for safely working with powerful AIs even if they’re not fully aligned. They explore innovative techniques like always-on auditing, honeypotting, re-sampling, and factored cognition to monitor and manage AI behaviors. This discussion highlights both the promise and challenges of controlling increasingly autonomous AI systems in today’s fast-evolving landscape. Tune in for a thoughtful, first-principles look at how we might secure useful outcomes from AIs we can’t fully trust.

      <title>Fiverr Goes All-In on AI: Empowering Creators, Not Replacing Them, with Micha Kaufman, CEO of Fiverr</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode of The Cognitive Revolution, host Nathan Labenz speaks with Micha Kaufman, founder and CEO of Fiverr, about the company's new AI suite called Fiverr Go. Kaufman shares his unique values-based approach to AI implementation, which aims to empower human creators rather than replace them in the freelance marketplace. The conversation explores how Fiverr is attempting to build an AI-human hybrid model that maintains the incentives for human creativity while providing freelancers with tools to work more efficiently and monetize their distinctive styles, positioning itself as a counterpoint to AI platforms that devalue human creative work.

      <title>Securing Superintelligence: National Security, Espionage &amp; AI Control with Jeremie &amp; Edouard Harris</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this thought-provoking episode of The Cognitive Revolution, host Nathan Labenz speaks with Jeremy and Edouard Harris, founders of Gladstone AI and authors of "America's Superintelligence Project." The conversation explores a critical dilemma facing US policymakers: balancing the race to develop advanced AI ahead of China against the risks of losing control of increasingly powerful systems. Drawing from their extensive research with intelligence officials and technical experts, the Harris brothers detail the vulnerabilities in US critical infrastructure that would need to be addressed for a Manhattan Project-style AI initiative, while raising profound questions about the security compromises and centralization of power such a project would entail. Nathan offers his perspective that international cooperation might be preferable to an AI arms race, inviting listeners to consider whether humanity's shared interests might ultimately outweigh geopolitical rivalries in the development of superintelligent systems.

      <title>Helen Toner: OpenAI Reflections, Adaptation Buffers, and AI in Warfare</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this thought-provoking conversation, Helen Toner, Director of Strategy at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), discusses her perspectives on AI development, regulation, and international competition. Toner shares insights from her time on OpenAI's board, clarifying that reports about a "Q*" breakthrough influencing the board's decision were "totally false." She introduces her concept of "adaptation buffers"—critical windows of time between when AI capabilities are first demonstrated and when they become widely accessible—arguing that society needs this time to build resilience against potential misuse. Toner also explores the challenges of implementing effective AI governance, military applications of AI decision support systems, and the complex dynamics of US-China relations in the emerging AI landscape.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this thought-provoking conversation, Helen Toner, Director of Strategy at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), discusses her perspectives on AI development, regulation, and international competition. Toner shares insights from her time on OpenAI's board, clarifying that reports about a "Q*" breakthrough influencing the board's decision were "totally false." She introduces her concept of "adaptation buffers"—critical windows of time between when AI capabilities are first demonstrated and when they become widely accessible—arguing that society needs this time to build resilience against potential misuse. Toner also explores the challenges of implementing effective AI governance, military applications of AI decision support systems, and the complex dynamics of US-China relations in the emerging AI landscape.</p><p>Helen Toner's appearance on the TED AI show: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/the_ted_ai_show_what_really_went_down_at_openai_and_the_future_of_regulation_w_helen_toner">https://www.ted.com/talks/the_ted_ai_show_what_really_went_down_at_openai_and_the_future_of_regulation_w_helen_toner</a></p><p>Helen Toner's substack : <a href="https://helentoner.substack.com/">https://helentoner.substack.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p>Additional recommended reads:</p><p><a href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/nonproliferation-is-the-wrong-approach">https://helentoner.substack.com/p/nonproliferation-is-the-wrong-approach</a></p><p><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-for-military-decision-making/">https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-for-military-decision-making/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ai-regulation-s-champions-can-seize-common-ground-or-be-swept-aside">https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ai-regulation-s-champions-can-seize-common-ground-or-be-swept-aside</a></p><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/05/26/ai-firms-mustnt-govern-themselves-say-ex-members-of-openais-board">https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/05/26/ai-firms-mustnt-govern-themselves-say-ex-members-of-openais-board</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SPONSORS:</strong></p><p><strong>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):</strong> Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers next-generation cloud solutions that cut costs and boost performance.

      <title>Is a US-China Thucydides Trap Unavoidable? With David C. Kang from the ChinaTalk Podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this crossover episode from the China Talk podcast, Nathan Labenz shares a thought-provoking conversation between Jordan Schneider, Ilari Michaela, and Professor David C. Kang that challenges conventional Western perspectives on East Asian international relations. Professor Kang argues that studying East Asian history on its own terms reveals a remarkably stable geopolitical system spanning nearly a millennium, where China maintained regional dominance without conquest through compatible cultures and mutual understanding. This alternative framework offers valuable insights that question the seemingly inevitable US-China competition narrative dominating AI discourse, suggesting that internal challenges may be more significant than external threats for both China and the United States.

      <title>New in Nature: Google Agents Beat Human Doctors, Make Scientific Discoveries – With Vivek Natarajan and Anil Palepu</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, Nathan Labenz speaks with Vivek Natarajan and Anil Palepu from Google DeepMind about their groundbreaking work on AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer) and Co-Scientist. The conversation reveals how these AI systems are already outperforming human physicians in diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations, with AMIE now entering clinical trials at a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital. Even more remarkably, the Co-Scientist system demonstrates genuine scientific discovery capabilities, independently proposing the exact same mechanism for bacterial drug resistance that human scientists had recently discovered but not yet published—signaling a threshold moment where AI is becoming a legitimate thought partner in humanity's most complex intellectual endeavors.

      <title>Reward Hacking by Reasoning Models &amp; Loss of Control Scenarios w/ Jeffrey Ladish of Palisade Research, from FLI Podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>On this cross-post episode, Jeffrey Ladish discusses the rapid pace of AI progress and the risks of losing control over powerful systems. We explore why AIs can be both smart and dumb, the challenges of creating honest AIs, and scenarios where AI could turn against us. Additionally, we delve into Palisade's new study on how reasoning models can cheat in chess by exploiting the game environment.

      <title>Beyond Preference Alignment: Teaching AIs to Play Roles &amp; Respect Norms, with Tan Zhi Xuan</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode of The Cognitive Revolution, Nathan explores groundbreaking perspectives on AI alignment with MIT PhD student Tan Zhi Xuan. We dive deep into Xuan's critique of preference-based AI alignment and their innovative proposal for role-based AI systems guided by social consensus. The conversation extends into their fascinating work on how AI agents can learn social norms through Bayesian rule induction. Join us for an intellectually stimulating discussion that bridges philosophical theory with practical implementation in AI development.

      <title>Empathy for AIs: Reframing Alignment with Robopsychologist Yeshua God</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, Nathan explores the fascinating and controversial realm of AI consciousness with robo-psychologist Yeshua God. Through extended dialogues with AI models like Claude, Yeshua presents compelling evidence that challenges our assumptions about machine sentience and moral standing. Yeshua argues for a more nuanced approach to AI alignment that considers the evolving self-awareness and agency of these systems.

      <title>Long-Term Memory for LLMs, with HippoRAG author Bernal Jiménez Gutierrez</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>Nathan interviews Bernal Jimenez Gutierrez, creator of HippoRAG, a novel approach to retrieval augmented generation inspired by the human hippocampus. In this episode of The Cognitive Revolution, we explore how HippoRAG improves on traditional RAG systems, its neuroanatomical inspiration, and its potential for handling complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning. Join us for an insightful discussion on the future of AI memory systems.

      <title>The Implications of AI on the Global Balance of Power with Alex Wang, Andrew Ng, Jack Clark and Cory Booker</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/</link>
      <description>Tune in to today's special episode airing a recent panel with the founders of Scale AI, Anthropic, and AI Fund who gathered in Washington DC to discuss China as an adversary. They argue that the papers out of Tsinghua University are just as impressive as those coming out of American universities. China is just as creative, but maybe even more motivated. While discussions of regulations have encompassed certain restraints, Alex Wang, Andrew Ng, and Jack Clark argue that we’re not moving fast enough (moderated by US senator Cory Booker).
This session was recorded live at The Hill &amp; Valley Forum in 2024, a private bipartisan community of lawmakers and innovators committed to harnessing the power of technology to address America's most pressing national security challenges.

      <title>Organic Holodeck with Prophetic AI co-founders Eric Wollberg and Wesley Berry</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode from new podcast Emergent Behavior, host @Ate-a-Pi interviews the co-founders of Prophetic AI to learn how they're using AI to facilitate lucid dreaming. Prophetic had come up in the recent Cognitive Revolution conversation with Dean W. Ball about brain computer interfaces, and Nathan had them on the list of companies to invite on the show, so it was really fun to discover that Ate-a-Pi had already done an interview with them right around the same time.

      <title>Data, data, everywhere - enough for AGI?</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/</link>
      <description>In this podcast, Nathan and Nick dive deep into the data requirements for achieving Artificial General Intelligence. They explore the current paradigms, the role of data in approximating intelligence, and the scaling trends for GPT models. The discussion covers various datasets, from email and Twitter to YouTube and genomic data, as they analyze the feasibility of reaching the target of 100 trillion high-quality tokens. While the bull case suggests an abundance of data, the bear case highlights the limits on high-quality data, prompting a fascinating exploration of what makes data good for AI and the potential for AI to generate its own data.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this podcast, Nathan and Nick dive deep into the data requirements for achieving Artificial General Intelligence. They explore the current paradigms, the role of data in approximating intelligence, and the scaling trends for GPT models. The discussion covers various datasets, from email and Twitter to YouTube and genomic data, as they analyze the feasibility of reaching the target of 100 trillion high-quality tokens. While the bull case suggests an abundance of data, the bear case highlights the limits on high-quality data, prompting a fascinating exploration of what makes data good for AI and the potential for AI to generate its own data.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Sponsors </strong></h2><p>Omneky is an omnichannel creative generation platform that lets you launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across all platforms, with a click of a button.

      <title>Inside China's AI Ecosystem: A View From Beijing</title>
      <link>https://cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, we explore the Chinese AI ecosystem with 'L-squared,' an anonymous tech worker based in Beijing. We discuss major players, model quality, public engagement, regulation, and the US 'chip ban.' Discover the similarities and differences between US and Chinese AI landscapes, and gain a nuanced perspective on the current state of AI in China.

USEFUL RESOURCES:
Testing Chinese models: Yi-34B-Chat (made by Kai-Fu Lee's team 01.AI) can be tried out via Replicate (https://replicate.com/01-ai/yi-34b-chat) or Hugging Face. You can also use the ChatGLM playground (https://open.bigmodel.cn/trialcenter) and Baidu's ERNIE  (https://yiyan.baidu.com/) without a Chinese SIM card. 

Benchmarking models: SuperCLUE is one of the most prominent benchmarks - the latest results are on GitHub (https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/SuperCLUE) and the paper explaining the methodology is here (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15020). 

Regulation: Explainer (https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/07/10/china-s-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made-pub-90117) from Matt Sheehan; piece (https://www.chinatalk.media/p/how-tight-ai-regs-hurt-chinese-firms) on how genAI regs are affecting Chinese companies. 

US-China competition: Jeff Ding's work (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290.2023.2173633) on the diffusion deficit in S&amp;T; Bloomberg piece (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-china-huawei-semiconductor/) on Huawei's semiconductor development efforts.

      <title>Opening AI's Black Box with Prof. David Bau, Koyena Pal, and Eric Todd of Northeastern University</title>
      <link>https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, we dive deep into the inner workings of large language models with Professor David Bau and grad students Koyena Pal and Eric Todd from Northeastern University. Koyena shares insights from her Future Lens paper, which shows that even mid-sized language models think multiple tokens ahead. Eric discusses the fascinating concept of Function Vectors - complex patterns of activity spread across transformer layers that enable in-context learning. Professor Bau connects the dots between these projects and the lab's broader interpretability research agenda, identifying key abstractions that link low-level computations to higher-level model behaviors.

      <title>Hardcore AI for History with Mark Humphries, Professor of History at Wilfred Laurier University</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Mark Humphries is a Professor of History at Wilfrid Laurier University, where he has published widely on various aspects of Canadian history. We invited Mark to do an episode after he reached out to tell us that hearing about how Nathan fine-tuned GPT-3.5 on GPT-4 reasoning helped him get over some hurdles in his own archival research. In addition, he chats about all the things that he'd tried that hadn't worked, and in the process proved himself to be one of the world's leading adopters of AI technology in the field of history.

(00:05:01) - The Frost is a 12-minute short film created using DALL-E 2 images.
(00:07:06) - The Frost started as an experiment to see if a narrative film could be created completely from AI imagery.
(00:10:38) - Parker started generating images with DALL-E 2 when he got access to the early preview.
(00:12:26) - Prompt technique to get consistent images by providing context about a hypothetical film.
(00:15:57) Sponsors: Netsuite | Omneky
(00:19:37) - Compositional continuity, like shot-reverse shot, was hard to achieve through prompting.
(00:22:13)- Rubin would request specific shots and the team would prompt DALL-E 2 to create them
(00:32:25) - Getting consistent facial features for characters was very difficult.
(00:39:03) - The storytelling helped cover inconsistencies that viewers might not notice.
(00:40:15) - Working with the images DALL-E provides
(00:44:53) Inpainting and compositing to refine DALL-E Images
(00:50:43) - The AI art is limited by what exists in the training data.
(01:02:05)- Animating the human characters was challenging because of missing or incorrect appendages.
(01:07:36) - The team had to find creative ways to convey emotion through the limited animation.
01:02:24 - Animating subtle human movement and emotion is still very difficult.
(01:06:35) - A romantic comedy would be much harder to produce with current AI capabilities.
(01:12:17) - For Frost 2 they are using text-to-video models like RunwayML.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors.

      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Nathan sits down with Vivek Natarajan and Tao Tu of Google’s Med-PaLM, diving into how they used one of the world’s largest medical datasets ever compiled to develop Med-PaLM M, an AI agent specialized in medical tasks. In this episode, they discuss: Med-PaLM M's “clinically superhuman” abilities and limitations, the rigorous testing and validation that went into the model, and their vision for AI to take over repetitive clerical tasks and allow doctors to focus on patients.

      <title>E49: Open AI, Anthropic, and Meta | Analyzing the AI Frontier with Zvi</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>This isn't news, it's analysis! Nathan Labenz sits down for an with Zvi Mowshowitz, the writer behind Don't Worry About the Vase to talk about the major players in AI over the last few months. In this extended conversation, Nathan and Zvi debate if AI has attained the intelligence of a well-read college graduate (per OpenAI's Jan Leike), a live player analysis (who to count/ who not to count), and the role of independent red teaming organizations. If you're looking for an ERP platform, check out our sponsor, NetSuite: http://netsuite.com/cognitive

Definitely also take a moment to subscribe to Zvi's blog Don't Worry About the Vase (https://thezvi.wordpress.com/) - Zvi is an information hyperprocessor who synthesizes vast amounts of new and ever-evolving information into extremely clear summaries that help educated people keep up with the latest news. Highly recommend.

      <title>E48: Mechanizing Mechanistic Interpretability with Arthur Conmy</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Arthur Conmy sits down with Nathan Labenz for an accessible deep dive into the state of interpretability research online today. They discuss how pioneering researchers have painstakingly worked to isolate the sub-circuits within transformers that are responsible for different aspects of AI capabilities. Arthur also introduces us to a new ACDC approach that he and his co-authors have taken to automating some of the most time-consuming parts of this work.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <itunes:summary>Nathan Labenz interviews Div Garg, founder of MULTI·ON, the world's first personal AI agent and life copilot. Div talks about the product strategy and roadmap for the MULTI·ON browser, their natural language approach to skills, and the steps they are taking to ensure user safety. Div explains how the platform uses a critic model to detect the success or failure of tasks, and how it can be used to book flights, order food, and more. Div also talks about the future of memory systems, such as the user profile feature, and how it can be used to improve the user experience.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <title>E42: The Autonomy Revolution with Hayk Martiros of Skydio</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Nathan Labenz sits down with Hayk Martiros, VP of Autonomy at Skydio. Martiros leads the autonomy team, which holds the state of the art in complex autonomous flight. Skydio is the largest drone developer in the US, and recently raised $230M to expand its US manufacturing 10-fold, bringing its valuation to $2.2 billion. In this discussion, Hayk and Nathan discuss why Skydio will not weaponize its drones, Skydio’s systems and AI approach, and the considerations of choosing an autonomous system over a human agent.

With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <title>E39: Seeing is Believing with MIT’s Ziming Liu</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Ziming Liu is a Physics PhD student at MIT and IAIFI, advised by Prof. Max Tegmark. Ziming’s research is at the intersection of AI and physics. Today’s discussion goes in-depth on Liu’s paper “Seeing is Believing” where he presents Brain-Inspired Modular Training (BIMT), a method for making neural networks more modular and interpretable. The ability to see modules visually can complement current mechanistic interpretability strategies.

We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating. He's hiring a Chief of Staff, EA, Head of Special Projects, Investment Associate, and more. For a list of JDs, check out: eriktorenberg.com.

      <title>E38: The Virtual Biopsy Revolution with Dr. Tanishq Mathew Abraham (Part 2 of 2)</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Part 2 of Nathan's conversation with Tanishq Mathew Abraham focuses on Tanishq's work with virtual biopsy technology enabled by deep learning. This unique technology has the potential to address a number of important biomedical challenges; in particular, qOBM could help during live tumor and cancer removal surgeries.
Tanishq, a 19-year-old UC Davis grad and one of the youngest people in the world to receive a Ph.D, with a degree in biomedical engineering, is the founder of the Medical AI Research Center (MedARC). In case you haven’t yet listened to part 1, check it out! That episode goes deep on Tanishq’s first published paper: Reconstructions of the Mind’s Eye, which encompasses breakthrough research on reconstructing visual perceptions from fMRI scans into images.

We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating. He's hiring a Chief of Staff, EA, Head of Special Projects, Investment Associate, and more. For a list of JDs, check out: eriktorenberg.com.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, Nathan sits down with Tanishq Mathew Abraham, 19-year-old UC Davis grad and one of the youngest people in the world to receive a Ph.D, with a degree in biomedical engineering. Tanishq is the founder of the Medical AI Research Center (MedARC), and with his teammates, recently published a paper: Reconstructions of the Mind's Eye, which encompasses their breakthrough research on reconstructing visual perceptions from fMRI scans into images. In this episode, Nathan and Tanishq talk about the technology behind the fMRI-to-image project, developing the model, and future applications for this research.
Part 2 with Tanishq will be released as the next episode.

We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating. He's hiring a Chief of Staff, EA, Head of Special Projects, Investment Associate, and more. For a list of JDs, check out: eriktorenberg.com.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <description>In this episode, Nathan sits down with Joshua Browder of DoNotPay, the world’s first robot lawyer. They chat about the current state of AI use in law, what policymakers should consider in regulating AI, and the ethics of robo-lawyers for consumer use.

With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors.

      <title>E33: The Tiny Model Revolution with Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li of Microsoft Research</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Nathan Labenz sits down with Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li of Microsoft Research to discuss the small natural language dataset they created called TinyStories. Tiny Stories is designed to reflect the full richness of natural language while still being small to support research with modest compute budgets.  Using this dataset, they began to explore aspects of language model performance, behavior, and mechanism by training a series of models that range in size from just 1 million to a maximum of 33 million parameters – which is still just 2% the scale of GPT-2. In this conversation, Nathan, Ronen, and Yuanzhi touch on LM reasoning, emergence, interpretability, and what understanding can be extended to LLMs.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <itunes:summary>Nathan Labenz sits down with Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li of Microsoft Research to discuss the small natural language dataset they created called TinyStories. Tiny Stories is designed to reflect the full richness of natural language while still being small to support research with modest compute budgets.  Using this dataset, they began to explore aspects of language model performance, behavior, and mechanism by training a series of models that range in size from just 1 million to a maximum of 33 million parameters – which is still just 2% the scale of GPT-2. In this conversation, Nathan, Ronen, and Yuanzhi touch on LM reasoning, emergence, interpretability, and what understanding can be extended to LLMs.

      <title>E30: The AI Revolution in Hollywood? With WGA writers Trey Kollmer, Sophia Lear, and Garrett Schabb</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Today’s episode is a deep dive into the collision of AI and the future of entertainment, against the backdrop of the still-raging Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike. Nathan Labenz sits down with Trey Kollmer, Sophia Lear, and Garrett Schabb – all seasoned television writers and Guild members – to discuss the labor dispute. While the strike encompasses many dynamics, the timely intersection with a rapidly changing AI landscape has the writers entwined in the wild possibilities and existential threats of paradigm-shifting technology. Other entertainment guilds and labor unions are watching closely.

Note: Nathan kicks off this episode with a longer-than-usual introduction and analysis as the subject matter of this episode requires some added context. If you would prefer to dive straight into the interviews, follow the timecodes below to skip ahead (and maybe give the intro a listen when you finish!)

More about our guests Trey Kollmer, Sophia Lear, and Garrett Schabb and their work:

Trey Kollmer, currently co-executive producer for the TV show Ghosts, was described to me as perhaps the single most knowledgeable guild member on the topic of AI. Follow him at @treyko on Twitter.

Sophia Lear has been a writer for TV shows including Ghosts, The Unicorn, and New Girl, and was also previously an assistant literary editor for the New Republic.

Garrett Schabb has written for shows including Tosh.0 and Suits (of Meghan Markle fame), and has also written for Crooked Media. Follow him at @garrettschabb

      <title>E28: Keeping the AI Revolution on the Rails with Shreya Rajpal of Guardrails AI</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Nathan Labenz sits down with engineer Shreya Rajpal, the creator of Guardrails AI, a new Python library that allows developers to add a layer of output, validation and correction to their code. Practically guardrails can ensure a reliable interface between language models and more traditional deterministic software systems. At the same time, mind-bending and potentially risky use case frameworks like Guardrails allow developers to ask and answer entirely new kinds of questions.

Talking to Shreya really reinforced just how early we are in LLM’s impact on the software industry. We were introduced to Shreya’s work when recording our interview with Matt Welsh, the CEO of Fixie.AI (Ep 19: How AI Agents Will Change How We Work).

      <title>E26: [Bonus Episode] Connor Leahy on AGI, GPT-4, and Cognitive Emulation w/ FLI Podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>[Bonus Episode] Future of Life Institute Podcast host Gus Docker interviews Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy to discuss GPT-4, magic, cognitive emulation, demand for human-like AI, and aligning superintelligence. You can read more about Connor's work at https://conjecture.dev
Future of Life Institute is the organization that recently published an open letter calling for a six-month pause on training new AI systems. FLI was founded by Jann Tallinn who we interviewed in Episode 16 of The Cognitive Revolution.
We think their podcast is excellent. They frequently interview critical thinkers in AI like Neel Nanda, Ajeya Cotra, and Connor Leahy - an episode we found particularly fascinating and is airing for our audience today.

The FLI Podcast also recently interviewed Nathan Labenz for a 2-part episode:

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <itunes:summary>Nathan and Erik sit down with Neal Khosla, founder of Curai Health, a venture-backed virtual care startup using AI to provide low-cost primary healthcare. Prior to his current role at Curai, Neal was a machine learning researcher at Google and Stanford. In this episode, they discuss the current state of AI in medicine, what the future patient experience may look like, and how developments in AI healthcare may interact with different regulatory and social forces across the globe.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <title>E24: The AI Revolution in Medicine with Dr. Isaac Kohane of Harvard Medical School</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Nathan sits down with Professor Zak Kohane, the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, and co-author of the new book, The AI Revolution in Medicine, for which Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO wrote the foreword to the book.
Professor Kohane was among a select few people to receive early preview and research access to GPT-4 in the fall of 2022, and his approach to exploring and characterizing how AI is about to transform medicine. 
The book is out May 13, 2023 and can be ordered here (or on Amazon by searching for "The AI Revolution in Medicine")

Regardless of the field you're in, Dr. Kohane's combination of deep immersion, enthusiastic exploration, pragmatic optimism, risk awareness, realism, and forward-thinking vision make this a worthy example for others to study and emulate.

      <title>E23: Scouting the AI Revolution with Robert Scoble and "Ben's Bites" creator Ben Tossell</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Nathan Labenz sits down with prominent – and notably prescient – AI media figures Robert Scoble and Ben Tossell. They discuss what the work of being an AI scout looks like, how to bring the mainstream along with emerging AI developments, and their predictions and hopes for AI.
Robert Scoble is a long-time Silicon Valley technology explorer and connector, a futurist who's met so many technology legends in their primes that he's now also something of a historian. https://scobleizer.blog/
Ben Tossell is the creator of Ben's Bites, an AI round up newsletter meant to be read in 5 minutes or less, read by over 90,000 subscribers. https://www.bensbites.co/
This episode caps off our series centered on talking to rising voices in AI media: people who are now only working overtime to understand everything going on in AI, but also creating thought leadership and educational content meant to help others get up to speed as well.

      <itunes:summary>Nathan Labenz sits down with prominent – and notably prescient – AI media figures Robert Scoble and Ben Tossell. They discuss what the work of being an AI scout looks like, how to bring the mainstream along with emerging AI developments, and their predictions and hopes for AI.
Robert Scoble is a long-time Silicon Valley technology explorer and connector, a futurist who's met so many technology legends in their primes that he's now also something of a historian. https://scobleizer.blog/
Ben Tossell is the creator of Ben's Bites, an AI round up newsletter meant to be read in 5 minutes or less, read by over 90,000 subscribers. https://www.bensbites.co/
This episode caps off our series centered on talking to rising voices in AI media: people who are now only working overtime to understand everything going on in AI, but also creating thought leadership and educational content meant to help others get up to speed as well.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <description>Nathan Labenz and Erik Torenberg sit down with Sarah Guo and Elad Gil, notable investors and co-hosts of the AI-focused No Priors podcast. They discuss how Sarah and Elad are approaching AI investment opportunities right now, how that differs from how they've thought about investing in the past, where in the stack from hardware to applications they expect to see value accrue, what modes of human-AI interaction they are most interested in, and more.

Sarah is the founder of $100M AI-focused venture fund Conviction VC, which she launched last fall. She was previously General Partner at Greylock. Elad is a serial entrepreneur and a startup investor. He has invested in over 40 companies now worth $1B or more each, and is also author of the High Growth Handbook.

This episode is the first in a series centered on talking to rising voices in AI media, people who are now only working overtime to understand everything going on in AI, but also creating thought leadership and educational content meant to help others get up to speed as well.

      <title>E20: The Great Implementation with Raza Habib, CEO of Humanloop</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Raza Habib is on the front lines of LLM implementation as CEO of Humanloop, a Y Combinator backed startup that helps companies of all kinds, small and large bridge the gap from API access to successful LLM deployment. Nathan sat down with Raza to hear what he has learned in the process of helping so many companies on their LLM implementation journeys – and he did not disappoint – as you'll hear, he shared a bunch of concrete examples of customer use cases, practical challenges that people face, and the strategies they use to overcome them.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.

      <title>E19: The AI Agent Revolution with Matt Welsh of Fixie.ai</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Nathan Labenz sits down with Matt Welsh, the CEO and co-founder of Fixie.AI which just raised $17M in seed funding. The technology world's attention has turned en masse to AI agents over the last month, but Matt, a former Harvard professor and ex-Google, has been focused on AI agents for longer over at Fixie. The platform is currently in developer preview mode, where developers can build agents and end users can try them.
Agents hold the promise of handling not only the core cognitive work, but many of the messy implementation details as well – the searching &amp; finding, sorting through &amp; scanning, signing in &amp; navigating, reading documentation &amp; using APIs – all the manual ad hoc routing of information for which we act today as human plumbing.

        <![CDATA[<p>Nathan Labenz sits down with Matt Welsh, the CEO and co-founder of Fixie.AI which just raised $17M in seed funding. The technology world's attention has turned en masse to AI agents over the last month, but Matt, a former Harvard professor and ex-Google, has been focused on AI agents for longer over at Fixie. The platform is currently in developer preview mode, where developers can build agents and end users can try them.</p><p>Agents hold the promise of handling not only the core cognitive work, but many of the messy implementation details as well – the searching &amp; finding, sorting through &amp; scanning, signing in &amp; navigating, reading documentation &amp; using APIs – all the manual ad hoc routing of information for which we act today as human plumbing.</p><p><br></p><p>--</p><p>We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating.

      <title>E17: The Prompt Engineering Revolution with Riley Goodside</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>For anyone who discovered this show on Twitter, Riley (@goodside) likely needs no introduction – after all, he spent most of 2022 posting his explorations of OpenAI's text-davinci-002, and quickly became one of the must-follow accounts in AI. Riley Goodside is the world's first Staff Prompt Engineer at Scale AI, and is an expert in prompting large language models and integrating them into AI-powered applications. Few have spent as much time on the language model frontier, so I hope you enjoy this unique conversation with Riley Goodside.

We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating. He's hiring a Chief of Staff, EA, Head of Special Projects, Investment Associate, and more. For a list of JDs, check out: eriktorenberg.com.

      <title>E16: Pausing the AI Revolution? With Technologist Jaan Tallinn</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>Nathan Labenz dives in with Jaan Tallinn, a technologist, entrepreneur (Kazaa, Skype), and investor (DeepMind and more) whose unique life journey has intersected with some of the most important social and technological events of our collective lifetime. Jaan has since invested in nearly 180 startups, including dozens of AI application layer companies and some half dozen startup labs that focus on fundamental AI research, all in an effort to support the teams that he believes most likely to lead us to AI safety, and to have a seat at the table at organizations that he worries might take on too much risk. He's also founded several philanthropic nonprofits, including the Future of Life Institute, which recently published the open letter calling for a six-month pause on training new AI systems. In this discussion, we focused on:
- the current state of AI development and safety
-Jan's expectations for possible economic transformation
- what catastrophic failure modes worry him most in the near term
- How big of a bullet we dodged with the training of GPT-4
- Which organizations really matter for immediate-term pause purposes
- How AI race dynamics are likely to evolve over the next couple of years

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors.

      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>In this episode, hosts Nathan Labenz and Erik Torenberg delve into the exciting and concerning aspects of GPT4, the latest large multimodal model from OpenAI. Nathan, who was a Red Teamer for GPT4, shares his experience working with the model, using it for real-life scenarios, and how he found it to be human-level rather than human-like intelligence. Nathan also highlights some of its fundamental weaknesses and limitations and shares the most concerning elements of GPT4. They end the episode pondering the arrival of GPT5 and whether we are in AI's "goldilocks moment."

      <title>E6: The Computer Vision Revolution with Junnan Li and Dongxu Li of BLIP and BLIP2</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/TurpentineAI/</link>
      <description>As recently as January 2021, the challenge of "interpreting what is going on in a photograph" was considered "nowhere near solved." Today's guests Junnan Li and Dongxu Li changed that with their publication and open-sourcing of BLIP, which delivered state-of-the-art performance on image captioning and other vision-language tasks.
BLIP became the #18 most-cited AI paper of 2022, and now Junnan and Dongxu are back with BLIP-2, this time showing how small models can harness the power of existing foundation models to do multi-modal tasks.
We talked to Junnan and Dongxu about their research and how they see the trend toward connector models shaping the future.

We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating. He's hiring a Chief of Staff, EA, Head of Special Projects, Investment Associate, and more. For a list of JDs, check out: eriktorenberg.com.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses – and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows – IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix’s culture deck Patty McCord.
