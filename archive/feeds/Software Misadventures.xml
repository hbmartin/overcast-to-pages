He joins the show to talk about his journey in tech - from teaching himself how to code at a young age, building, maintaining and reverse engineering software as a teenager, building ISPs in the early part of his career (there are some fun stories that involve sleeping in the data center) to leading the SRE org at LinkedIn over the last decade. He talks about the early days at LinkedIn that involved a lot of firefighting to keep the site up, how the team built technical stability and scaled the platform. We also dive into how he grew the SRE org globally and overcame challenges that came with the growth. Throughout the conversation, he shares various nuggets of wisdom - like how to stay calm under pressure and how to make people feel at ease - as he describes his leadership style, people who have influenced him and what he thinks is a positive way to collaborate with people.</div> <div> </div> <div> <p>Website link: <a href= "https://softwaremisadventures.com/julia" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://softwaremisadventures.com/bruno</a></p> <div> <div> </div> <div>Music Credits:</div> <div>Vlad Gluschenko <span class="color_15">— Forest</span></div> <div><span class="color_15">License: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0</span></div> <div><span class="color_15">Unported: <a href= "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en" target= "_blank" rel= "nofollow noopener">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en</a></span></div> </div> </div> </div>]]></description>
