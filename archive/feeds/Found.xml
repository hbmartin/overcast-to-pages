(6:15) Enterprise applications for AI language models
(12:12) Building multilingual models
(14:58) Fundraising and the AI bubble

03:03 - Early days and initial ideas for Motorway
05:50 - Pivot to its current model
08:08 - Working with dealerships

25:39 - The co-founding team and their long-term collaboration

      <description> There is a whole marketplace for used tech, it isn’t just a good deal for the customer, but it also helps curb waste that can lead to soil contamination, non-pot able water, and dangerous living conditions.  On this week’s episode of Found, we’re talking to Thibaud Hug de Larauze from BackMarket, a global marketplace for refurbished devices.
In this conversation they cover:

How BackMarket has such a successful fundraise.

Building customer trust as a refurbished marketplace

      <title>Navy Seal to maritime founder with Joe Wolfel from Terradepth</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/navy-seal-to-maritime-founder-with-joe-wolfel-from-terradepth-ugpoeEBn</link>
      <description>Despite the fact that water covers 71% of the Earth, there is still so much we don’t know about the ocean floor and  today’s founder is looking to change that. Joe Wolfel is the co-founder and CEO of Terradepth, the company that is working towards increasing ocean knowledge through autonomous, high resolution, scalable data collection in the deep ocean. On this week’s episode of Found, Becca is joined by guest co-host, Tim De Chant to discuss why mapping geological features at the bottom of the ocean isn’t just something worth doing for curiosity’s sake, it’s important to a variety of players from companies looking to install offshore wind farms to the Navy. They also get into who is buying this kind of data, how Wolfel’s experience as a Navy Seal prepared him for entrepreneurship, and the trend of deeptech founders needing to find revenue streams early on as they’re developing their technology.

      <title>Making DTC western wear work with Paul Hedrick from Tecovas</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/making-dtc-western-wear-work-with-paul-hedrick-from-tecovas-ljp9zHqO</link>
      <description>It probably doesn’t come as too big of a surprise that cowboy boots aren’t typically sold online. So where is the modern cowboy supposed to shop? This week we’re talking to a founder who carved out a DTC market for western wear.  Paul Hedrick, the founder of Tecovas,  joins Dom and Becca to discuss the marketing strategy they came up with to change the perception of shopping for cowboy boots online and how the company has expanded to brick and mortar stores. 
In this conversation they cover:

How social media played a big role in the early days of tecovas

The challenges of modernizing such an old-school industry

Fundraising when DTC was almost a dirty word.

      <title>Policy is crucial to spread the AI wealth with Steve Case from AOL and Revolution Ventures</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/policy-is-crucial-to-spread-the-ai-wealth-with-steve-case-from-revolution-tQlVcoEz</link>
      <description>This week on Found, we have an interview from TechCrunch's Strictly VC event in DC. Becca sat down with Steve Case, the founder of AOL to discuss policy, innovation, and AI. Case, now the founder of Revolution Ventures, told the live audience that open access not only helped his company back in the 90s but is also why the internet was able to progress in the way that it did. Regulators should aim for the same goal with AI policy despite the potential risks. He  argues that opening  up access to horizontal AI players like OpenAI and Google would also help expand AI away from being concentrated on the coasts.
 
(0:00) Introduction
(1:29) AI regulation compared to the internet’s early days
(6:20) Supporting AI startups outside the traditional hugs
(11:49) AI Policy and the innovation economy
(16:40) Entrepreneurship and job creation in the US

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/creating-cookware-that-wont-poison-you-with-jordan-nathan-WWg7eanm</link>
      <description>Many pots and pans on the market are coated in teflon, a poisonous chemical that can be harmful when it gets too hot. Luckily, there is an answer on the market — Caraway, a home goods brand that touts itself as being non-toxic but still high quality. Jordan Nathan founded the company after his own experience with Teflon poisoning that left him searching for a better — and healthier option. On this week’s episode of Found, Dom and Becca are joined by Nathan to discuss how he built a brand around aesthetically pleasing non-toxic home goods as we continue to dive into DTC companies. 
In this conversation they discussed:

Why being the last brand to fundraise can be a benefit to the company

Sticking to the plan to bring Caraway to retail

The product launch failure that almost killed the company before it started

(13:05) Caraway Brand Strategy
(16:44) Expanding to new categories

      <description>There is estimated to be 40 million acres of lawn or turf grass in the U.S., making the grass in people's backyards one of the largest crops in the U.S. and yet lawn care products are full of harmful chemicals. So Coulter Lewis decided to start a sustainable lawn care company that will help people learn how to care for their grass in a way that’s good for the planet. Sunday is a DTC that allows consumers to sign up and send in a sample of the dirt from their lawn that is used to pick out what products someone needs and tell them how much and when they need them.
In this conversation they cover:

How Coulters previous experience starting Quinn Snacks with his wife informed how he leads at Sunday

The challenges and perks of building with family members

Evolving the products from bespoke DTC offerings to general consumer in-store goods

(0:00) Introduction
(4:28) Creating personalize law care plans
(9:34) Launching DTC in this climate
(14:55) Expanding into new categories
(20:50) using data to improve products

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/ai-that-actually-makes-your-job-easier-arvind-jain-from-glean-NFwse7EI</link>
      <description>When someone starts two incredibly successful enterprise companies, they must really understand the issues enterprises face and how to solve them. This week on Found, Becca and Dom talk with Arvind Jain, the CEO and co-founder of Glean, an AI-powered work assistant that connects and understands enterprise knowledge. The idea for Glean was born out of Jain’s experience at his previous startup Rubrik.In this conversation they cover: 

How Jain knew it was time to start a new company and why it didn’t make sense to build Glean inside of Rubrik

The importance of building a self-sufficient leadership team and the downside of micromanaging

Why cybersecurity is top of mind when working with enterprise data at an AI company

Why the overturning of Roe V. Wade has led to increased interest in ADAM by men in the US

The future of Contraline and other innovations that use hydrogels

(0:00) Introduction
(2:26) The challenges to male birth control
(6:53) Why hydrogel works
(9:35) Developing ADAM
(15:08) Cultural reaction to ADAM

(28:09) What’s next for Contraline
(34:23) Host conversation

      <title>Building EV charging infrastructure that lasts with Louis Tremblay from FLO</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/louis-tremblay-from-flo-KA9dbnnb</link>
      <description>In order to get drivers to convert from gas-powered cars to electric, there needs to be reliable charging infrastructure. Today on Found, Dom and Becca are joined by Louis Tremblay, the CEO and founder of FLO, a company that manufactures electric vehicle charging stations and has been creating charging infrastructure in the US and Canada for the last 15 years. Tremblay also talked about how he intentionally built this company to be a rewarding and fun place to work and what advice he has for new founders trying to do the same. 
In this conversation they cover:

The components that go into creating superchargers for public use and why these isn’t just one kind of EV plug

The process of working with cities to design charging stations that reflect the character of the city

The importance of developing the hardware alongside the software to create the best customer experience possible

      <title>Giving old wood new life with Ben Christensen from Cambium</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/giving-old-wood-new-life-with-ben-christensen-from-cambium-er1fH_Dx</link>
      <description>If you’re not in construction or in the middle of a renovation, you might not think much about wood waste but in 2018 alone landfills in the US received 12.2 million tons of wood. Most of this is useful material that could be reused, but the lack of infrastructure means the wasted wood can't always reach the developers, woodworkers, and creators who need it. This week on Found, we're talking to a founder who has a SaaS solution for this broken supply chain. Ben Christensen is the founder and CEO of Cambium, a company that is reimagining the wood supply chain and reallocating previously wasted wood to be used in new building projects. 
In this conversation they cover:

Learning to navigate the logistics of sourcing, selling, and shipping wood to customers

Building a team culture based on the individual and avoiding a one size fits all approach

Onboarding customers who may be adverse to technological solutions

How AI can help create a more efficient lumber supply chain

(0:00) Introduction
(1:42) What Cambium is all about
(5:01) Climate change and wood recycling
(11:36) Developing the software
(15:54) Sourcing sustainable wood
(18:41) Going from grad school to founder
(20:01) Fundraising journey
(23:59) AI and supply chains
(25:49) Building the team
(30:15) Learning from logistics mistakes
(32:30) Staying grounded while building climate solutions
(36:40) Host conversation

      <title>Training AI-powered recycling robots with Rebecca Hu from Glacier</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/training-ai-powered-recycling-robots-with-rebecca-hu-from-glacier-3_UmhVkH</link>
      <description>Recycling is one facet to solving the climate crisis, but most of us are doing it wrong. Today on Found, Becca and Dom are talking with Rebeca Hu, the CEO and cofounder of Glacier, an AI robotics company that is building robots to accurately sort recycling. They talk about how many of us are wish-cylers who hopefully throw non-recyclables into the bin and how Glacier’s robots are sorting the recycling and making sure all of our recycling mistakes are corrected.
They also talked about:

What it takes to train an AI-powered sorting robot

What the reception has been like in recycling facilities

How the robots are tracking the kind of waste we’re creating as they sort

How Rebecca told this story to fundraisers who have very likely never stepped foot in a recycling center.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/taking-a-dtc-brand-to-irl-stores-with-gabi-lewis-from-magic-spoon-g0rOfSqt</link>
      <description>Grab your spoon and a carton of milk because today on Found we’re talking to Magic Spoon co-founder and CEO Gabi Lewis. Magic Spoon creates cereal flavors that play on our nostalgia for Fruit Loops and Cocoa Puffs with a grown-up high-protein twist. Dom and Becca talk with Gabi about how he and his co-founder prioritized product-market fit and found investors who didn’t think cereal was dead. They also talked about:

What Gabi learned from his previous startup Exo which made cricket-protein bars and how he’s changing his leadership style at Magic Spoon

Transitioning from being a solely DTC brand to in-store retailer and how he’s learned to manage buyer relationships and store-to-store drama.

How meticulously they develop new cereals and how they’ve incorporated customer feedback.

(1:45)  Magic Spoon TLDR
(3:38) Innovating in the food industry
(11:40) Managing DTC and IRL retail
(24:00) Acquisitions and competition

      <title>Lessons from 20 years in the language learning business with Markus Witte from Babbel</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/babbel-on-found-PHyi7zm_</link>
      <description>On today’s episode of Found, Dom and Becca talk to Markus Witte, co-founder of Babbel, a language learning app that had been operating since 2007. Babbel has become one of the most prominent language-learning apps but their first product was essentially just a vocab game and they quickly discovered that a multi-modal way of learning will always be more effective. Markus also talked about why he decided to step down as CEO and take on the role of chairman and how all four co-founders have worked together to stick to the original mission of Babbel even after nearly 20 years. 
They also talked about:

Being a very early adopter of a subscription business model

The struggles of fundraising in Berlin in 2008 and how to operate intentionally lean

How the company has implemented AI tools back when AI was still machine learning.

Building a team that is deeply rooted to the original mission and how Markus developed the skills of an empathetic leader

      <description>Medicaid is in its regulatory moment. Today we’re joined by Neil Batlivala from Pair Team, which is building the infrastructure that will help the most vulnerable populations get the clinical and social care they need through the Medicaid expansion. Dom and Becca talked to Neil about how his previous health tech experience lead him to start a company solely focused on connecting care facilities like food pantries and shelters to clinical training and care through Medicaid funding. They also talked about: 

Why there is a gap in health tech to serve our most vulnerable communities

The regulatory issues that dictate the businesses growth and expansion to new states

How he thinks about doing well financially and doing good in the world

      <title>Can sustainable FashionTech save the world?</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/can-sustainable-fashiontech-save-the-world-_ZuEc3e8</link>
      <description>Today on Found, we have something a little different and extra special for you. We’re bringing you two bonus conversations all about sustainability in fashion from TechCrunch Disrupt 2023. First up you’ll hear our very own Harri Weber sit down with three guests, Jim Ajioka from Colorifix, Beth Esponnette from unspun and Julie Willoughby from Circ. They are all powerhouses in sustainable fashion and they all happened to join Harri on the Sustainability Stage. Watch their full conversation here. 
In part two, we have a great conversation between TechCrunch’s Morgan Sung and Jemima Bunbury from BLEND, which is a curated fashion app that is changing the way we shop online. They focus on impulse purchases, how to help customers develop their own style and, of course, how we can make it possible to stay trendy and shop sustainably.
Some topics they covered include:

Fixing the fashion supply chain so all the materials are created in a sustainable way

Helping consumers find products that will last

Enticing larger brands to shift to sustainable practices

Why a holistic approach to sustainable fashion is crucial when trying to eliminate waste in the industry

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/bringing-digital-infrastructure-for-developing-countries-with-nasrat-khalid-from-aseel-sKUl4G8f</link>
      <description>On today’s episode, host Becca Szkutak is joined by our old friend Darrell Etherington to talk with Nasrat Khalid of Aseel. Aseel started as an ecommerce company making it possible for local artisans in Afghanistan to sell to customers across the world and has evolved into working in humanitarian aid delivering emergency food supplies to people in need in Afghanistan and Turkey.
They talk about:

How Aseel built a digital infrastructure that made it possible for artisans to sell to customers all over the world

How the company shifted from ecommerce to humanitarian aid when Afghanistan went into crisis

The struggle to get investment when the company is considered so high-risk

The ethical concerns that arise when your business focuses on the world’s most vulnerable populations

      <title>What not to do when getting your grocery startup off the ground with Abhi Ramesh from Misfits Market</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/what-not-to-do-when-getting-your-grocery-startup-off-the-ground-with-abhi-ramesh-from-misfits-market-4KjPj5b_</link>
      <description>Launching an e-commerce startup in the grocery space is no small task. On today’s episode Becca and Dom are joined by Abhi Ramesh, the CEO and founder of Misfits Market, a grocery startup that sells surplus and unwanted produce directly to consumers who don’t mind funny-looking foods. They talk about how he started the company in his apartment handling every aspect from personally buying the unwanted produce from the farms, to storing the food, to packaging and shipping, all while running the website and trying to fundraise. He racked up six-figure credit card debt to fund the logistics-heavy startup before raising his first seed round — and that was just the first three months of the company.They also talked about:

The systemic issues that have created a massive amount of produce waste

Changing consumer behavior when shopping for food and how COVID helped their business

The lessons Ramesh learned after Misfits Markets acquired Imperfect Foods and what the next steps are for the company

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/solar-powered-everything-with-giovanni-fili-of-exeger-lyhJ1KaV</link>
      <description>This week’s episode features a conversation with Giovanni Fili, the founder and CEO of Exeger, a startup that creates flexible solar cells that can create electric energy off of any light condition. Fili talked about what it has been like devoting the last 15 years of his career to a company based on tech that hadn’t previously been proven to work. He talked about running a deep tech company as a non-technical founder and how he’s built a capital-intensive startup off of relatively little funding.

      <title>Making wearable medical devices more patient-friendly with Professor Esther Rodriguez-Villegas from Acurable</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/making-wearable-medical-devices-more-patient-friendly-with-professor-esther-rodriguez-villegas-from-0Cpc7O66</link>
      <description>This week, our old friend Darrell Etherington joins Becca Szkutak to talk with Professor Esther Rodriguez-Villegas from Acurable. Acurable is a medical device company that makes patient-friendly wearable devices that accurately diagnose and manage respiratory conditions at home. As a career-long academic,  Rodriguez-Villegas never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices made it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy. On this episode they talk about balancing academic research and running a company, how to scale a medical device startup, and how Acurable has spread to hospitals throughout the UK by just word of mouth.

      <title>Live from TechCrunch Disrupt with cybersecurity trailblazer Window Snyder from Thistle Technologies</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/live-from-techcrunch-disrupt-with-cybersecurity-trailblazer-window-snyder-from-thistle-technologies-s1DVDL7P</link>
      <description>The Found team recorded this episode live from TechCrunch Disrupt. Dom and Becca sat down with Window Snyder, a trailblazer in the cybersecurity industry who has dedicated her decades-long career to ensuring the internet and our devices are secure.  Snyder talked about why after years of working at companies like Apple, Microsoft, Fastly, and Square now was the right time to launch her startup, Thistle, which looks to build the security infrastructure needed to keep internet-connected smart devices safe.
They also covered:

The way her mother’s career as a programmer inspired her to learn how to code has a teenager

Why a core value of Thistle is making cyber security easy for developers

Her biggest challenge in fundraising was demonstrating that this is a problem that the rest of the industry recognizes that they're going to want to leverage these capabilities in order to improve the security of their products.

Check out the UpFlip  Podcast  where you get to unravel how great businesses are built, how they are run behind the scenes and how their success can be replicated. We think you'll love episode 79 where they featured this guest who transformed his passion for gardening into a $7.3 million-a-year venture. You can find the podcast on Youtube or where ever you listen to podcasts.

      <title>A social platform to map the way we think with Ida Josefiina from Sane</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/the-social-network-that-aims-to-save-us-from-ourselves-with-ida-josefiina-from-sane-5AIBw4Ez</link>
      <description>Have you ever thought about all of the experiences, shows, books, people, places, and other pieces of media that have all been mixed together to make your unique personality and interests? Do you think you could build a multi-media map to visually show all of these elements? On today’s episode of Found, the co-founder and CEO  of Sane, Ida Josefiina is explains how they’re breaking social networking as we know it to find a solution for collective reasoning and even mitigate existential risk. 
In this episode you’ll learn:

How Josefiina accidentally became an entrepreneur in the tech industry

Why New York is the best place for a company like Sane and the argument for having an in-person work culture.

How spatial mapping can visually represent the way we think to better explain difficult concepts.

Today’s episode dives into the mind of Ida Josefiina, the co-founder and CEO of Sane, a social knowledge-sharing platform. Josefiina talked about how her foray into existentialist ideas and the power of collective intelligence put her on a journey to start this company. She spoke about how she thinks about hiring for the mission-driven company and how it could scale. Plus, she talked about why she doesn’t consider Sane to be a social media platform.

      <title>Educating VCs on your lived experience with Rebecca Rosenberg from ReBokeh</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/building-discrete-vision-assistance-with-rebecca-rosenberg-from-rebokeh-A_SpJlBM</link>
      <description>This episode focuses on ReBokeh, a startup that created an app that applies filters that allow people with low vision to see better. The founder and CEO Rebecca Rosenberg talked about how her own experience with having low vision inspired the product and what it was like building the startup as an undergrad when everything went remote in 2020. She also spoke about how the app will likely have multiple revenue streams and what it was like pitching the product to VCs who didn’t believe the disability Rebecca has even exists.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/what-companies-are-getting-wrong-about-dei-with-mandy-price-from-kanarys-1rjPEAXZ</link>
      <description>This week’s episode features a conversation with Mandy Price, the co-founder and CEO at Kanarys, a SaaS startup that helps companies tackle their diversity and inclusion problems with data. Mandy talked about why she started the company after a decade-long career as a lawyer. She also talked about why she didn’t want Kanarys to just be focused on hiring metrics, as many other DEI platforms are, and when the company decided to start building out its sales team after years of inbound interest.

      <title>Growing a startup banking alternative while the banking sky is falling with Immad Akhund from Mercury (Equity Interview)</title>

      <description>As a founder, you’ve got to be ready for anything, but nothing could have prepared Mercury CEO and founder Immad Akhund for the rapid growth his company experienced after the SVB bank crisis. We’re mixing it up this week and sharing an interview from our sister podcast, Equity. TechCrunch fintech reporter Mary Ann Azevedo talks with Akhund about how they onboarded a record number of startup customers and helped guide their current users through the SVB bank crash, how he thinks about fundraising and investing during this downturn, and how he thinks about standing out against competitors like Brex.
Becca and Dom will be back next week with an interview with Catherine Tabor from Sparkly.

      <title>Digital Nomads need insurance too with Sarah Sandnes from SafetyWing</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/digital-nomads-need-insurance-too-with-sarah-sandnes-from-safetywing-JrHjVWWl</link>
      <description>This week, Becca and Dom are joined by Sarah Sandnes, the co-founder and CTO of SafetyWing, which is creating a global safety net for remote workers. Sandnes is a digital nomad herself, so she understands the frustrations of frequently crossing borders and how difficult it can be to find affordable and high-quality health insurance as an employee. She also talked about how she and her co-founders have built a fully remote company that spans almost the entire globe -- because even digital nomads deal with time-zone frustrations.

      <description>Exciting news this week! Dominic-Madori Davis is joining Becca Szkutak as Found’s newest co-host. Say hi to her in a review or tweet us @found.
In this week’s episode, we are talking with the co-founders who are  reimagining boxed wine. Boxed wine hasn’t typically been thought of as aesthetically pleasing or particularly delicious, but Juliet co-founders Allison Luvera and Lauren De Niro Pipher, are on a mission to change that. According to the co-founders, glass bottles serve nothing but tradition and are a sustainability nightmare. So they dove into rebranding boxed wine with their elevated design and carefully selected profiles.

      <description>Getting diagnosed with a learning disability or attention disorder is crucial to getting students the support they need to be successful in the classroom, however, the assessments are extremely cost and time prohibitive. This week on Found Darrell and Becca are talking with Stefan Bauer about how Marker Learning is cutting the cost of learning disability assessments by conducting them remotely, how they’ve successfully worked with school districts to help them test their required amount of students, and the potential to take Marker Learning into the prison system to assess incarcerated people and provide them with tools to learn in a way that’s better suited to their abilities.
We also say goodbye to Darrell as a regular host of Found this week, but don’t worry you can still catch him every Friday on The TechCrunch Podcast!

      <title>Found is nominated for a Webby</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/found-is-nominated-for-a-webby-UmpLlqiq</link>
      <description>We’re thrilled to be nominated for a Webby award in the Best Technology Podcast category. You can help Found win by voting here. Voting closes April 20.
Building a startup is hard in any market and there is no right way to do it. You can rely on Found to get the real stories behind the startups and hear from entrepreneurs about how they’ve grown their companies and the choices they’ve made along the way.
Recently, we’ve had an awesome lineup of startups on the show, from Swedish fintech giant Klarna, to the company looking to bring the wooly mammoth back to life, to a woman-founded perfume company that just launched its first products — and everything in between.

      <title>Talking trash with Matt Roger from Mill</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/talking-trash-with-matt-roger-from-mill-w9EXINqX</link>
      <description>While working on developing the iPhone and then going on to co-found Nest, Matt Rogers became an expert in changing consumer behavior on a mass scale by creating products that seamlessly fit into everyday life. In his newest venture, he’s turned his sights to solving food waste starting in the kitchen. Mill sends customers a trash can that dries and shrinks kitchen scraps so they can be sent back to  be used for animal feed. In this episode, Matt, Darrell, and Becca talk about thinking through every part of the customer experience from packaging to sending back their food waste, why he prefers starting a company to investing in one, and what decisions he thinks defined his previous companies.

      <title>Augmenting creativity with Alice Albrecht from Re:collect (re-release)</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/augmenting-creativity-with-alice-albrecht-from-re-collect-s6oyujkd-q_v75oFp</link>
      <description>Last year when we talked to Alice Albrecht from Re:collect, the Found team couldn't stop thinking about the possibilities of a tool like Re:collect, so we're sharing this episode again. Re:collect is a software tool that augments creativity by helping people focus, recall, and connects their ideas. The conversation covered a lot of ground from how to hone your pitch when your product is so cerebral, how technology can help creativity but Alice argues will never replace it, and how developing AI requires building safeguards from the jump.

      <title>Modernizing 911 calls with Michael Chime from Found</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/modernizing-911-calls-with-michael-chime-from-found-dGenU0b6</link>
      <description>Michael Chime, the co-founder and CEO of Prepared, is leading the charge to modernize 911 calls by providing access to video and photos. Most people are calling in emergencies with their smartphones so the Prepared team is working to help dispatchers have all the data possible to relay to first responders. In today’s episode, they talk about implementing this new tech in an industry that’s slow to innovate, navigating privacy concerns when capturing and collecting videos of emergencies, and how he’s grown into the CEO role as the company has expanded.

      <itunes:subtitle>This week on Found, Darrell and Becca talk with  Alex Rappaport, the CEO and co-founder of ZwitterCo, which makes it practical for industries to recycle water and enhance product recovery with new filtration technology. Water scarcity is a looming issue that often gets overlooked in sustainability conversations. However, Alex has been heartened by his conversation with companies and investors by the nearly ubiquitous interest in investing in water-treatment solutions. In this episode, they get into how Alex has led with ESG messaging to investors and how his angel investors help set ZwitterCo up for successful rounds down the line. </itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Solving the looming lithium shortage with Sheeba Dawood from Minerva Lithium</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/solving-the-looming-lithium-shortage-with-sheeba-dawood-from-minerva-lithium-bwZH5STs</link>
      <description>This week we’re mixing it up on Found and welcoming special guest cohost, Neesha Tambe, the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield Editor. And we happen to be talking with Sheeba Dawood, the co-founder and CEO of Minerva Lithium—the 2022 Startup Battlefield winner. Minerva Lithium is a clean energy technology that has developed a Nano Mosaic membrane filter system for critical materials extraction from non-traditional water resources. In this conversation, Sheeba speaks candidly about the struggles she’s faced as a woman of color trying to innovate in the mineral manufacturing industry and what’s next for the company coming off of several pitch competition wins.

      <title>Two CEOs are better than one with Henrique Dubugras from Brex</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/two-ceos-is-better-than-one-with-henrique-dubugras-from-brex-bXjoGkmg</link>
      <description>This week Darrell and Becca are joined by Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras to chat about his corporate credit card and expense management startup. Henrique talked about what made him and his co-founder (Pedro Franceschi) decide to launch the company and why the friends, who met online as teenagers, decided to be co-CEOs. Henrique also talks about how Brex navigated changes at the startup this year, and how he personally handled layoffs, all while Darrell and Becca do a questionable job of hiding their disdain for Brex’s legacy competitor.

      <title>Checking back in with a few favorite founders (re-release)</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/checking-back-in-with-a-few-favorite-founders-re-release-oJb1WN4c</link>
      <description>Happy holidays! The found crew is taking a week off to relax so we are throwing it back to our anniversary episode. 
To celebrate our anniversary, we welcomed back four founders whose stories really stuck with us since we talked to them. In what Jordan called a “founder smoothie”, we talked with Brie Code from TRU LUV who was on our second episode, Earl Cole from SMART Tire Company who was on the following episode, as well as Aditi Shekar from Zeta, and Jelani Memory from A Kids Company About who joined us a few months later. They talk about perspective shifts they’ve experienced in the past year, their different takes on fundraising, and how they stay true to their respective core missions.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/augmenting-creativity-with-alice-albrecht-from-re-collect-wPqJNbJY</link>
      <description>Welcome back to found, the Stories behind the startups. This week co-hosts Darrell Etherington and Becca Szkutak talk with Alice Albrecht from Re:collect, a software tool that augments creativity by helping people focus, recall, and connect their ideas. The conversation covered a lot of ground from how to hone your pitch when your product is so cerebral, how technology can help creativity but Alice argues will never replace it, and how developing AI requires building safeguards from the jump.

      <title>Trusting your gut microbiome with Cheryl Sew Hoy from Tiny Health</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/found-tiny-health-bgSf80Pg</link>
      <description>Take our listener survey for a chance to win a free year of TC+ at bit.ly/tcpodsurvey.
When Ceryl Sew Hoy had her first child, she discovered the importance of the infant gut microbiome. As a research-driven entrepreneur, she learned everything she could about gut health and how to help infants avoid the chronic health issues that occur if they don’t receive the essential microbiomes from the mother. Tiny Health was started to fill a gap in OBGYN care and provide the first-ever gut health test for babies and toddlers along with educational materials needed to course correct and set up infants for optimal gut health.  Darrell, Becca, and Cheryl also talk about being a product-focused founder, building customer trust, and Darrell’s constant tummy aches.

      <title>Starting the tampon revolution with Valentina Milanova from Daye</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/starting-the-tampon-revolution-with-valentina-milanova-from-daye-v2arTn_q</link>
      <description>We’re so excited to be back with new episodes of Found and to introduce you to our brilliant new co-host Becca Szkutak! In this episode, we talk with Valentina Milanova, the founder and CEO of Daye, a gynecological health company that’s working to close the gender pain gap and raise industry standards when it comes to women’s health products.
While researching menstrual pain relief and tampon manufacturing, Valentina found there was a shocking lack of innovation, research, and health and safety standards in gynecological products. So she started Daye and created the most absorbent organic tampon on the market and the only one that uses CBD to relieve menstrual pain that was designed with women in mind. Within the company,  Valentina is infusing her values into every aspect of the business from implementing a 4-day work week to improve mental health to hiring survivors of human trafficking to work in their manufacturing centers. In this episode, we  also touch on the challenges of fundraising when your product requires you to say “vaginal canal” at least once in your pitch, why Valentina will not be a serial entrepreneur, and why they don’t keep any tampon trade secrets.

      <title>Tennis-star-turned-star-investor with Serena Williams from Serena Ventures</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/tennis-star-turned-star-investor-with-serena-williams-from-serena-vantures-71EifoER</link>
      <description>At last month’s TechCrunch Disrupt, Jordan sat down with Serena Williams and her co-founder Alison Rapaport Stillman to talk about their investment firm, Serena Ventures. The conversation was so interesting, we couldn’t help but share it on the Found feed. Serena, Allison, and Jordan talk about her approach to startup investing, how competitive she is both on and off the court, and how the French Open distracted her from the missed investment she regrets the most. And she shares how you can still expect to see her play tennis—if you’re able to snag an invite to come to her personal court.

      <title>Providing virtual gender-affirming care with Jerrica Kirkley and Matthew Wetschler of Plume</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/providing-virtual-gender-affirming-care-with-jerrica-kirkley-and-matthew-wetschler-of-plume-p_OezPWL</link>
      <description>Telehealth startups had a boom during the pandemic and for certain marginalized communities not having to physically go onto a traditional doctor’s office allows them to access specialized high-quality care. That’s where this week’s guests come in. Jerrica Kirkley and Matthew Wetschler are the co-founders of Plume, a telehealth company that focuses on transgender care. After Jerrica spent time working in the non-profit world she realized that to enact the change she wanted to see, a VC-backed startup could be a more direct route.  Along with providing great care, they’re also dedicated to combatting anti-trans legislation and gathering data on trans care that can help all physicians provide better holistic care. In this episode, they talk about their co-founder relationship, the importance of hiring a team that reflects the community they serve, and how they navigated fundraising in such a conservative environment.

That’s where this week’s guests come in. Jerrica Kirkley and Matthew Wetschler are the co-founders of Plume, a telehealth company that focuses on transgender care. After Jerrica spent time working in the non-profit world she realized that to enact the change she wanted to see, a VC-backed startup could be a more direct route.  Along with providing great care, they’re also dedicated to combatting anti-trans legislation and gathering data on trans care that can help all physicians provide better holistic care.

      <title>Making robots that make robots to take over the world with Scott Gravelle from Attatbotics</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/making-robots-that-make-robots-to-take-over-the-world-with-scott-gravelle-from-attatbotics-Exhz_k0F</link>
      <description>This week Darrell and Jordan talk with Scott Gravelle, the CEO and co-founder of Attabotics, a robotics company that specializes in distribution and supply chain. Scott talks about how he was inspired by the Cutter Ants to design a vertical warehouse and create an automated system that was not human-centric but instead functioned as a world that was great for robots. They also spoke about caring for mental health as a founder and developing new leadership skills for a virtual world.

      <title>Delivering remote abortion care with Kiki Freedman from Hey Jane (Re-Release)</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/delivering-remote-abortion-care-with-kiki-freedman-from-hey-jane-re-release-_M9EIram</link>
      <description>This time last year, we talked with Kiki Freedman the founder of Hey Jane, a virtual health care startup aimed at women with an initial focus on delivering remote abortion care. After the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe V. Wade, access to abortion is in a more precarious position than ever. Listen back to how Hey Jane provides access to consultations with doctors, available 24 hours a day, and home delivery for FDA-approved abortion pills. And Freedman tells us about how her experience at Uber informed her founder mentality at Hey Jane, and how the startup hopes to change the healthcare industry.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/building-the-great-pyramid-of-hybrid-work-with-phil-libin-from-mmhmm-_4pY2w0I</link>
      <description>When Phil Libin co-founded Evernote he spent tons of money making the perfect working environment with chic offices, a shuttle bus, and headphones to block out all of his employees' distracting co-workers. He’s since seen the work-from-home light and co-founded mmhmm to make working remotely more efficient and even more fun. In this episode, Phil breaks down his pyramid of communication, explains how embracing asynchronous videos changed everything about meetings at mmhmm, and why he will never go to work in the metaverse.

      <description>After graduating college, co-founders Amar Shah and Sonia Nigam were bored with at their first ”real jobs” so through trial and error they came up with the idea to develop an API that processes donations called Change. They talk with Darrell and Jordan about getting their first customers by literally knocking on shop doors, growing the company while maintaining the close-knit culture, and why incorporating crypto payments was a key part of their growth.

      <title>How do you build a company towards a $20B exit? with  Dylan Field from Figma</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/how-do-you-build-a-company-towards-a-20b-exit-with-dylan-field-from-figma-vX_h_p_P</link>
      <description>We spoke to Figma founder and CEO Dylan Field earlier this year, and while we didn’t know at the time that the startup would be entering into a deal to be acquired by Adobe for north of $20 billion, the lessons that Field shared around his journey building Figma and bringing on the right investors are definitely extra resonant now that the acquisition has been announced. Please enjoy this ‘greatest hit’ in light of the news!

      <title>Expanding the boundaries of health care with Kelsey Mellard from Sitka</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/expanding-the-boundaries-of-health-care-with-kelsey-mellard-from-sitka-mUn5ghos</link>
      <description>We talk to a lot of healthtech founders on this show because there are countless ways the healthcare system, particularly in the US, needs to be disrupted. This week, we talked to Kelsey Mellard who founded Sitka with the goal of implementing value-based care and helping primary care physicians make more thoughtful referrals to specialists. She talks with Darrell and Jordan about playing the long game to change how people receive care in the US and incentivize providers to give high-quality care instead of a high volume of care.

      <title>Remembering the doctor's orders with Shiv Rao from Abridge</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/remembering-the-doctors-orders-with-shiv-rao-from-abridge-XDFZw0t5</link>
      <description>This week’s guest Shiv Rao founded Abridge after experiencing how unnerving it can be to go through a medical emergency with a loved one—even for a practicing doctor like him. So he and the Abridge team created an app that doesn’t just transcribe a conversation between doctor and patient but can summarize the important parts, pull out the next steps, and even define any medical terms that were said so the patient walks away with all the information they need. The same technology helps doctors take better notes and alleviate the “pajama time” burnout by recording what happened in the appointment and synthesizing it in a format that is useful to a doctor. Darrell, Jordan, and Shiv talk about the importance of making an impact at scale in the medical field.

      <title>Building a revenge app with Jay Chandrasekhar from Vouch Vault</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/building-a-revenge-app-with-jay-jay-chandrasekhar-from-vouch-vault-VS4zxlzu</link>
      <description>Super Troopers premiered at Sundance to a receptive, giggling crowd but if you judged it based on its Rotten Tomato score and reviews, you’d think it flopped. Writer, director, comedian, and recent founder Jay Chandrasekhar never felt right about the critiques from random strangers online. So he set about creating  Vouch Vault, an app in which friends can recommend media, restaurants, and products to each other and users can trust those reviews because they’re coming from people with similar tastes. He talks with Darrell and Jordan about using a Hollywood approach to funding a tech company and how he is thinking about changing user behavior.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/making-the-creator-economy-comic-book-friendly-with-chris-giliberti-from-zestworld-LEAVLrCN</link>
      <description>Comics are the foundation for so many movies, TV shows, and video games however creators still struggle to be fairly compensated for their material. Chris Giliberti founded Zestworld, a creator-centered platform that offers solutions for the artist to publish their work, manage commissioned artwork, and own their IP and licensing. In this episode Chris and Darrell nerd out about upcoming projects, the best ways to monetize digital custom art, and building a community online that feels like walking through your local comic book store. Jordan is also there, just not nerding out because she has yet to find the comic book for her.

      <title>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress (Automattic)</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-automattic-ShTCsRiZ</link>
      <description>It’s rare we get to speak to someone who has been working at their company for 19 years so this conversation with Matt Mullenweg of Automattic and WordPress feels a little special. His journey to becoming a founder was grounded in a love for blogging and working on open source projects. Now WordPress is pretty much ubiquitous in the digital publishing world. He talks with Darrell and Jordan about how much different fundraising worked for him, how he has remained such an in-touch leader, and of course his thoughts on Web3.

      <description>Landed founder and CEO Vivian Wang is on a mission to connect blue-collar workers with high-quality job opportunities. Landed handles the hiring process from recruiting to vetting to setting up interviews and facilitating a feedback loop for the general managers to make their workplaces more desirable. They’re also improving employees' financial well-being by helping them upscale once they’ve landed the job. In the episode, Vivian talks about how COVID showed us all how essential blue-collar workers are and made apparent how underserved those workers are and how she plans to improve the experience in these jobs by helping them access pay quicker, build credit, and decrease turnover.

      <title>Anniversary Bonus: Founder Roundtable</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/anniversary-bonus-founder-roundtable-WXR1oAxx</link>
      <description>Happy one year of Found! To celebrate our anniversary, we welcomed back four founders whose stories really stuck with us since we talked to them. In what Jordan called a “founder smoothie”, we talked with Brie Code from TRU LUV who was on our second episode, Earl Cole from SMART Tire Company who was on the following episode, as well as Aditi Shekar from Zeta, and Jelani Memory from A Kids Company About who joined us a few months later. They talk about perspective shifts they’ve experienced in the past year, their different takes on fundraising, and how they stay true to their respective core missions. 
Take our listener survey and let us know a bit about yourself and what you think of FOUND.

The duo that an investor once compared to cockroaches for their ability to survive , talk to Jordan and Darrell about building such a trusting founder relationship, staying ahead of their competition by working closely with their customers – Web3 designers, and how they’ve managed to more or less leave their venture capital dollars in the bank.

      <title>Justin Intal, Forage</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/justin-intal-forage-czeV3ubo</link>
      <description>Justin Intal from Forage joined the Found crew live. He talks about how profound struggles in her personal life motivated him to create a way for online grocers to accept EBT and SNAP benefits. He also talked about the importance of vulnerability and transparency as a CEO. Each failure is learning, so he is not about hiding his past failed companies or ideas–in fact he has them written out on his Linkedin.

      <description>Sassie Duggleby is leading the team at Venus Aerospace to develop a spaceplane that could go from LA to Tokyo in an hour. As CEO, Sassie sets the tone that her team doesn’t have to adhere to the typical startup-up grind to solve some serious deeptech issues. She talks with Darrell and Jordan about honoring the company’s namesake–Venus, the goddess of love–and loving her customers and her employees well, all while working to bring the world closer together with greener, more efficient travel.

      <description>Thor Fridriksson is, as Jordan calls him, the kind of mobile gaming. With mega-viral games like Trivia Royale and QuizUp, he knows the secret sauce to making a popular game, but the code he hasn’t cracked is how to make a super lucrative game. Thor joined us on Found Live to talk about the pitfalls of ads on mobile games, why the experience of playing will always be his number one priority, and what he has cooking with his next company Rocky Road Inc.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/chriss-webb-chownow-oOWXUsOj</link>
      <description>ChowNow started as a way for founder and CEO, Chris Webb and his friends to easily order from smaller local restaurants but 8 years later when COVID hit ChowNow became known as a restaurant-friendly alternative to some of the larger players in the space. They began ranking in the app store organically and getting a boost in users and customers. Chris talks with Darrell and Jordan about the” fast and steady” approach to building a lasting company and how to seize a moment when growth occurs.

      <description>Help us Win a Webby by voting for us here: bit.ly/vote4found
Today on Found we talk to Anthony DiMare, the co-founder and CEO of Bedrock, a company which has developed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to survey and map the seafloor in a much more efficient and affordable way than the traditional “big ship with a big sonar” method.Darrell, Jordan, and Anthony get into why seafloor exploration could be the answer to many problems on land like finding space to build offshore wind farms and how there is an untapped blue-centered economy. Plus Anthony talks about his on-the-ground leadership style and how he's learned to love the salesmanship part of his job.

      <description>Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, started the company when he was 20 years old when he had no idea if anyone would see the value in making design a multiplayer game let alone that his company become the Google Docs of design. He chats with Darrell and Jordan about how his leadership style has evolved, how he handles the changing company culture as Figma grows, and how the nature of design has rapidly changed into the collaborative work it is now.

      <description>Everly Health founder and CEO Julia Cheek is taking steps to revolutionize healthcare by helping patients gain access to all kinds of medical testing and in doing so allowing providers to have the data they need to give the best care possible. Darrell and Jordan first met Julia at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2016 when she was a self-proclaimed “fish out of water”. On today’s episode, she talks about how she went from being a fresh first-time founder to a CEO and competent leader who has strategically acquired companies to create a holistic and vertically integrated home-testing company.

      <title>Matthew Wadiak, Cooks Venture</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/matthew-wadiak-cooks-venture-6rugpz98</link>
      <description>Most people don’t spend much time thinking about where their poultry comes from, much less what it was eating when it was alive but the feeding practices on large farms are harmful to the environment and have led to bland, unhealthy chickens. Today’s guest, Matthew Wadiak is a chef and founder and CEO of Cooks Venture which is on a mission to create a new breed of broiler chicken that is more active, able to eat a varied diet, and tastier. Through restorative agriculture and selective breeding, the Cooks Venture farm in Arkansas has bred chickens that are more heat resistant and can eat a variety of grains. As a chef and former co-founder of Blue Apron, Wadiak views it as his duty to try to change the food system for the better. 
Watch the Cooks Venture video about planting 20,000 Hazelnut trees in partnership with RAD.

      <title>Toyin Ajayi, Cityblock</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/toyin-ajayi-cityblock-iw_muRpj</link>
      <description>On Found Live Darrell and Jordan got to chat with Cityblock co-founder and president, Toyin Ajayi. CItyblock provides primary care,  behavioral health, and social care to folks who have been historically marginalized in the healthcare system, primarily people who are receiving their health insurance through Medicaid with the goal of providing high-quality holistic care at a lower cost. They do this through a network of physicians, community outreach teams, and by working with insurance providers. While Dr. Ajayi was working in a hospital system she became frustrated by the systemic issues that were sending the same patients back to the hospital time and time again. So she began experimenting with ways to extend her care like giving out her cell phone number, making house calls, being available to explain medications.

      <itunes:subtitle>On Found Live Darrell and Jordan got to chat with Cityblock co-founder and president, Toyin Ajayi. CItyblock provides primary care,  behavioral health, and social care to folks who have been historically marginalized in the healthcare system, primarily people who are receiving their health insurance through Medicaid with the goal of providing high-quality holistic care at a lower cost. They do this through a network of physicians, community outreach teams, and by working with insurance providers. While Dr. Ajayi was working in a hospital system she became frustrated by the systemic issues that were sending the same patients back to the hospital time and time again. So she began experimenting with ways to extend her care like giving out her cell phone number, making house calls, being available to explain medications. That idea grew into Cityblock where that level of personalized care is scaled. They talked about the healthcare system, how providers can improve care, Toyin’s spicy TechCrunch Disrupt panel, and answered a few audience questions.

      <description>Michelle You, co-founder and CEO of Supercritical, is on a mission to help companies get to net-zero but she refuses to sacrifice her personal life for the startup. Michelle talks with Darrell and Jordan about how motherhood has eased her imposter syndrome, the “scar tissue” she had from a tough exit of her first startup, why the planet needs more effective carbon removal methods now, and how she’s using those learnings as a second-time founder.

      <title>Sunil Paul, Spring Free EV</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/sunil-paul-spring-free-ev-_L5T6Aoa</link>
      <description>RSVP for Found Live. Don’t miss your chance to listen to episodes found early and interact with Darrell, Jordan, and their guests. On February 17th at 10am PT/ 1pm ET, Thor Fridriksson will be talking about his experience launching two viral games and founding his new company Rocky Road. 
When serial founder turned venture capitalist Sunil Paul decided to step back into startups, it was only after trying to give the idea behind his fintech company Spring Free EV away for over a decade. The idea is simple, bring down the initial cost of electric vehicles by charging owners a fee per mile. And after the wildfires in California lead to what he called the "orange sky day" he knew he had to figure out a way to do more to address the climate crisis by making EVs more accessible to the people who drive the most in the US. He joins Darrell and Jordan to talk about the end of the world, recruiting as a climate-focused fintech, fundraising, and of course Canada came up a few times too.

      <title>Elizabeth Ruzzo, adyn</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/elizabeth-ruzzo-adyn-umC__9el</link>
      <description>We’re in the business of talking to very impressive people who are working to solve incredibly tough problems— but Elizabeth Ruzzo, founder and CEO of adyn, may be one of the most impressive yet. Not only did she develop the only test for women to ensure they are prescribed the birth control that will be the least likely to have detrimental side effects, she also founded the company and fundraised as the sole employee of the company. She talks to Darrell and Jordan about the challenges she faced as a solo founder/employee raising money for a solution for birth control, why she decided to leave academia, and the complicated regulatory maze she had to navigate to get adyn off the ground.

      <title>Liz Young, Realm</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/liz-young-realm-q7eP_M9w</link>
      <description>Liz Young remembers when her family became homeowners, even at six years old she understood it was a big deal. That sparked a fascination with real estate and the home-owning experience. While working at Bloomberg, she discovered the importance of data-driven decisions in the housing market. She wanted to give the power of data to the average homeowner so she founded Realm which helps homeowners prioritize renovation projects to increase the value of the home and use their time and money wisely. Darrell, Jordan, and Liz talk about the tricky housing market, how powerful localized data is for homeowners, and how Darrell can renovate his basement dungeon gym for the greeted ROI.
Take our listener survey and let us know a bit about yourself and what you think of FOUND.

      <title>Ashley Sumner, Quilt (re-release)</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/ashley-sumner-quilt-re-release-PaR2uzsP</link>
      <description>As COVID-19 cases spike many people enter 2022 in some kind of quarantine,  a conversation about community and connecting across a digital space feels like just what the doctor ordered. Ashley Sumner's original concept for Quilt was all about meeting up in person — almost an Airbnb for conversations. But shortly after launch, the universe threw a wrench in the works, as a global pandemic shut down or severely limited in-person interaction almost everywhere, particularly among strangers connecting for the first time. Quilt made a pivot into the suddenly crowded social audio space, but Ashley explains how it kept its core focus and differentiation in the process.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/alexandra-bonetti-the-talent-hack-_isK6SNK</link>
      <description>While owning and operating studio gym spaces in New York, Alexandra Bonetti knew that it shouldn’t have to be this hard to establish processes for issues all gyms have like recruiting new members, hiring qualified talent, and getting substitutes for classes, to name a few. So she founded The Talent Hack which is a platform geared towards helping experts working in the fitness and wellness industry achieve tangible success. In this episode, she discusses her philosophy that everyone has superpowers and she is passionate about discovering those talents and making them work for the individual and how to be nimble as a new company in a complicated industry.

      <description>Yusuf Sherwani saw the value in remote mental healthcare long before COVID sent everyone into video therapy sessions. He is the CEO and one of three doctor/co-founders of Quit Genius, an app that uses CBT therapy and other proven methods to help patients tackle their addiction. He talks with Darrell and Jordan about starting a telehealth company before COVID and the regulatory hurdles they had to navigate and how they convinced investors that it was crucial to be research-led when it comes to building a patient-focused product.

      <description>The way COVID-19 has changed the way we work comes up a lot, founders have had to pivot and innovate to build companies during lockdown but the workplace restrictions seemed to spark inspiration for this week's guest, Larry Gadea, founder, and CEO of Envoy. Envoy started in 2013 as a guest sign-in platform to make offices safer and more efficient. Over the past 18 months, they've created new products to solve for many of the new issues offices have as they adapt to the new and frequently changing office safety protocols.  Larry talks about how remote work affected company culture, his work-life balance philosophy, and how his leadership style has grown with the company.

      <title>Megan O'Connor, Nth Cycle</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/megan-oconnor-nth-cycle-QpjcP06W</link>
      <description>This week we talk to the runner-up in Tech Crunch Disrupt's Startup Battlefield: Megan O'Connor from Nth Cycle. Megan first found out about the impending shortage of materials used in batteries, phones, electric vehicles, and many of the products needed for a more sustainable green economy while studying at Yale and immediately began working towards a solution. She co-founded Nth Cycle which has developed a technology to help mining and recycling companies recover every bit of critical minerals from their operations by more efficiently recycling the materials and working to fill the gaps in the supply chain.

      <description>After experiencing firsthand what Alzheimer’s does to patients and their families, Maria Shriver and Patrick Schwarzenegger, have launched MOSH, a nutrition company focusing on brain food. The mother and son duo combined her passion for advocacy with his experience in company building to create and a product and brand that will have people thinking about their brain health. They talk to Darrell and Jordan about how having a co-founder who is also your mother can have some additional stress, how they view health-food brands and the lofty promises of so many brands, and why we should all be thinking about our brain health no matter how old you are.

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/kiki-freedman-hey-jane-ArBKBEnc</link>
      <description>Kiki Freedman realized access to abortion care was already at risk long before Texas' SB8, and that was what inspired her to found Hey Jane, a virtual health care startup aimed at women with an initial focus on delivering remote abortion care. Hey Jane provides access to consultations with doctors, available 24 hours a day, and home delivery for FDA-approved abortion pills. Freedman tells us about how her experience at Uber informed her founder mentality at Hey Jane, and how the startup hopes to change the healthcare industry.

      <description>After a legal career that included litigation experience at a big NYC law firm, as well as stops in both the Washington and Alaska Attorney General offices, Jackie Schafer realized that one of the major challenges in litigation is accurate and thorough review and citation of the mass of documents and prior judgements involved in a case. That's why she founded Clearbrief, which could help level the playing field for small legal firms and unlock major efficiencies in the public justice system. Also, she's an amazing singer!

      <description>Tanya Van Court's professional career includes a lot of high-profile positions at Nickelodeon, ESPN, Discovery, and more.

      <description>Hilary Coles co-founded telehealth startup hims &amp; hers back in 2017, and the now-public company has expanded its focus considerably since then, including adding a full vertical dedicated to women's health. We talked to Hilary about building a healthcare brand focused on individual customer experience, with a brand designed to appeal to a new generation of healthcare recipients that haven't felt catered to by existing models.

      <title>Jenn Graham, Inclusivv</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/jenn-graham-inclusivv-d_HFrRRD</link>
      <description>Jenn Graham's startup Inclusivv looks very different from when it begins Civic Dinners in 2016. The idea back then was to take advantage of small group dynamics around in-person meetings — and dinners in particular — to foster important conversations around difficult topics, originally focusing on connecting government with the community. Inclusivv took that model, shifted it to digital in the wake of Covid, and expanded the mandate to help big brands and companies handle the topics their employees and users care most about, like sustainability, diversity and belonging.

        <![CDATA[<p>Jenn Graham's startup Inclusivv looks very different from when it begins Civic Dinners in 2016. The idea back then was to take advantage of small group dynamics around in-person meetings — and dinners in particular — to foster important conversations around difficult topics, originally focusing on connecting government with the community. Inclusivv took that model, shifted it to digital in the wake of Covid, and expanded the mandate to help big brands and companies handle the topics their employees and users care most about, like sustainability, diversity and belonging.</p><p>Links for this episode:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inclusivv.co">Inclusivv</a></li></ul><p>Connect with us:</p><ul>

      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/celine-halioua-cellular-longevity-yhCHhzGb</link>
      <description>Celine Halioua has spent much of her career focusing on life extension technology — but her own company started with a specific target of extending the lives of dogs, rather than humans. We hear from her why she wanted to start with canine companions, though her larger goals with her company Loyal include extending and improving our own lives, too.

      <title>Liya Shuster-Bier, Alula</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/liya-shuster-bier-alula-auUWs3_a</link>
      <description>Liya Shuster-Bier learned first-hand, twice over, that cancer care leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to everything beyond the basics, and it's incredibly hard to navigate not just for patients themselves, but also for their loved ones and care network. That inspired her creation of Alula, a platform designed to help consolidate the resources that cancer patients, survivors and their care networks need to face tough challenges together.

      <title>Clarisse Beurrier, Animal Alternative Technologies</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/clarisse-beurrier-animal-alternative-technologies-tKwaN_7W</link>
      <description>Clarisse Beurrier went right from school to a lab-grown meat startup called Higher Steaks, and both her experience during her education and that first job in the field left her feeling like more needed to be done at a fundamental level, linking the work happening in research labs and universities to the commercial meat industry. That was the genesis for Animal Alternative Technologies, a company she co-founded with the mission of providing a scalable, end-to-end cultured meat production system for food sellers large and small alike.

      <title>Amanda DoAmaral, Fiveable</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/amanda-doamaral-fiveable-Zhi5QTNs</link>
      <description>Amanda DoAmaral was an educator herself before she decided to found a tech company aimed at improving the education system. That's a surprisingly rare credential for a startup founder in this area to possess — despite the obvious benefits of real, first-hand experience. Her company, Fiveable, focuses on modernizing (including a remote-first approach) a key and often overlooked part of education for students: Building an active community of peers to share knowledge with. Hear how she took her dissatisfaction with an inadequate system and turned that into the motivation to build a venture-scale business outside of it.

      <description>Oleg Stavitsky and his founding team at Endel are not your conventional startup founders: This artists' collective has been working together for years across multiple projects, and it just so happens that their latest collaboration ended up being a venture scale technology company. Endel is all about creating personalized soundscapes to trigger desired emotional and mental states, and the story of how it came to be is hardly your typical consumer app origin tale.

      <title>Ashley Sumner, Quilt</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/ashley-sumner-quilt-LEhYYAxX</link>
      <description>Ashley Sumner's original concept for Quilt was all about meeting up in person — almost an Airbnb for conversations. But shortly after launch, the universe threw a wrench in the works, as a global pandemic shut down or severely limited in-person interaction almost everywhere, particularly among strangers connecting for the first time. Quilt made a pivot into the suddenly crowded social audio space, but Ashley explains how it kept its core focus and differentiation in the process.

      <description>Rob Schutz didn't expect to be working on a startup addressing the need for reliable, direct-to-consumer erectile dysfunction therapeutics, but that's where he ended up at Roman. The company has since pivoted to become 'Ro,' with a focus on digital health and telemedicine more broadly, as well as pharmacy services, but we talk to Schutz about how he went from Bark Box to human health, and what the experience of building his startup alongside his two cofounders was like.

      <title>Sara Spangelo, Swarm</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/sara-spangelo-swarm-98_J083E</link>
      <description>Sara Spangelo's startup Swarm now has nearly 100 of its satellites in orbit, but the journey to get here has had plenty of challenges. After a track record that included working at Google X, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and plenty more, Sara realized with her co-founder Ben that including low-bandwidth network capabilities on tiny satellites was not only possible, but offered massive cost-savings vs. the usual way of doing things. But our talk focuses on the challenges of being a first-time founder and CEO, and creating a whole new business model.

      <description>Cory Siskind founded Base Operations after realizing that the enterprise operations security market lagged behind its equivalent information security departments in terms of tech and innovation. She tells us how she went from being dropped into a heap of responsibility for assessing street-level threats in Mexico City right out of school for large global companies, to creating a scalable, tech-powered solution that finally brings the industry out of the 70s.

      <title>Roslyn McLarty, The GIST</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/roslyn-mclarty-the-gist-PKsnbzDn</link>
      <description>After realizing there was a serious lack of options for sports fans who happen to be women, or who just don't fit the typical mould addressed by the existent industry, Roslyn McLarty and her two co-founders created The GIST, a sports newsletter that has since grown into a podcast and a website, too. The GIST doesn't shy away from the human side of sports, nor does it treat sports like a secret club you need years of specialized knowledge to access.

      <title>Leigh Honeywell, Tall Poppy</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/leigh-honeywell-tall-poppy-CZStZGui</link>
      <description>Leigh Honeywell has spent her career trying to prevent bad things from happening to people on the internet. She’s spent time at Slack, Heroku, and Microsoft, and is well-versed on both the technical and human sides of online harassment, and has seen first-hand how it can escalate to hacking or worse. That’s how she came up with Tall Poppy, a platform that helps organizations with a public-facing workforce, like media orgs, actively prevent this type of escalation. The Tall Poppy model turns what would be an unscalable business into a fast-growing startup.

      <description>As a career marketer, Lindsay Tjepkema was used to trying a lot of different strategies and seeing what works. She started to see one type of marketing consistently paying off, however — particularly for B2B brands. That's how she came up with the idea for Casted, a B2B podcast platform that makes it easy technically and in tiers of content for enterprise companies to create their own podcasts to reach their clients and potential customers.

She started to see one type of marketing consistently paying off, however — particularly for B2B brands. That's how she came up with the idea for Casted, a B2B podcast platform that makes it easy technically and in tiers of content for enterprise companies to create their own podcasts to reach their clients and potential customers.</p><p>Links for this episode:</p><ul>

      <title>Courtne Smith, NewNew</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/courtne-smith-newnew-sZZCG4ww</link>
      <description>After starting her career as part of Drake's management team, founder Courtne Smith has gone on to create a couple of different apps aimed at capitalizing on new and emerging behavior in online social interaction. Her latest venture, NewNew, is a bit like a stock market mixed with a crowdsourcing platform for the decision-making of creators, artists, and even just everyday, ordinary people. We talk to Courtne about her path to entrepreneurship, and what's happening in social that's changing how people want to engage.

She shares what it's like to work at Google's famous moonshot factory, how she came to pursue a moonshot of her very own, and how she grappled with the realization that her startup needed to significantly change gears to serve its target market.

His startup is working with NASA to commercialize metal tire technology first developed to provide future Mars rovers with nearly indestructible wheels for tackling the toughest terrain, and Cole tells us all about how his background as a serial entrepreneur, and the first unanimous Sole Survivor, helped him navigate NASA's bureaucratic network.

      <title>Brie Code, TRU LUV</title>
      <link>https://found.simplecast.com/episodes/brie-code-tru-luv-rOPSTiwz</link>
      <description>This week's guest is Brie Code, founder and CEO of TRU LUV. In Brie's own words, TRU LUV is building "ritual and emotionally-conscious AI," which sounds ambitious and potentially world-changing because it is. Brie's background as a game developer led her to explore alternate types and motivations for game-like experiences, and that resulted in constructing AI in a mobile app that espouses a "tend-and-befriend" approach.

      <itunes:subtitle>On the premiere of Found, hosts Darrell Etherington and Jordan Crook interview Iman Abuzeid, the co-founder and CEO of Incredible Health. Iman's founder story includes going through medical school, and getting her MBA, all in service of pursuing a family legacy of entrepreneurship. She used her combined experience and expertise to tackle one of the biggest problems in healthcare in the U.S. — or anywhere: The talent gap in nursing. You'll hear how she came up with the idea for Incredible Health, and how she used a bold vision, backed by practical planning, to build a category-defining business and raise venture capital.</itunes:subtitle>
