      <itunes:summary>Powerful large-scale AI models like GPT-4 are showing dramatic improvements in reasoning, problem-solving, and language capabilities. This marks a phase change for artificial intelligenceâand a signal of accelerating progress to come.Â Â In this Microsoft Research Podcast series, AI scientist and engineer Ashley Llorens (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/allorens/) hosts conversations with his collaborators and colleagues about what these modelsâand the models that will come nextâmean for our approach to creating, understanding, and deploying AI, its applications in areas such as healthcare and education, and its potential to benefit humanity.This episode features Senior Principal Research Manager Ahmed H. Awadallah (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hassanam/), whose work improving the efficiency of large-scale AI models and efforts to help move advancements in the space from research to practice have put him at the forefront of this new era of AI.

      <itunes:summary>In âJust Tech: Centering Community-Driven Innovation at the Margins,â Senior Principal Researcher Mary Gray (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mlg/) explores how technology and community intertwine and the role technology can play in supporting community-driven innovation and community-based organizations. Dr. Gray and her team are working to bring computer science, engineering, social science, and community together to boost societal resilience in ongoing work with Project Resolve (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-resolve/). Sheâll talk with organizers, academics, technology leaders, and activists to understand how to develop tools and frameworks of support alongside members of these communities. In this episode of the series, Dr. Gray talks with Dr. Tawanna Dillahunt (http://www.tawannadillahunt.com/), Associate Professor at University of Michiganâs School of Information, Zachary Rowe, Executive Director of Friends of Parkside (https://friendsofparkside.org/), and Joanna Velazquez, Campaign Manager at Detroit Action (https://detroitaction.org/). The guests share personal experiences where community and research collaborations have been most impactful in solving problems, talk about ways that participatory research can foster equal partnerships and fuel innovation, and offer perspectives on how researchers can best work with communities to work through problems at a local level. They also discuss the role that technology playsâand doesnât playâin their work.https://www.microsoft.com/research (https://www.microsoft.com/research)</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For Microsoft researchers, COVID-19 was a call to action. The reimagining of work practices had long been an area of study, but existing and new questions that needed immediate answers surfaced as companies and their employees quickly adjusted to significantly different working conditions. Teams from across the Microsoft organizational chart pooled their unique expertise together under <i>The New Future of Work</i> initiative. The results have informed product features designed to better support remote work and are now being used to help companies, including Microsoft, usher their workforces into a future of hybrid work.</p>
<p>In this episode of <i>The New Future of Work</i> series, Chief Scientist <a target="_blank" title="Jaime Teevan at Microsoft Research" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/teevan/">Jaime Teevan</a> and Principal Productivity Engineer <a target="_blank" title="Brian Houck at Microsoft Research" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-houck-b4123132/">Brian Houck</a> discuss what the massive shift to remote work meant for developersâboth employees of Microsoft and customers using Microsoft developer platforms to support their work. Theyâll talk about how taking a holistic approach to developer productivity can benefit both efficiency and happiness, with an emphasis on the important role social connections and processes play in a field often thought of as an isolated endeavor. They also explore pros and cons of everyday developer tasks, like code review and whiteboarding, being done in a hybrid work setting.</p>

<p>In this episode, Senior Principal ResearcherÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hallcott/">Hunt Allcott</a> talks with Postdoctoral Researcher <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/evanrose/">Evan Rose</a> about Allcottâs work exploring the everyday decisions people face, like buying fuel-efficient cars or taking out payday loans, and how a clearer understanding of these decisions can shape meaningful public policy. Allcott shares how his and othersâ research shows that policy can often have complex outcomes resulting in hidden benefits and drawbacks, as in the case of taxes on sugary beverages. The researchers also discuss why individuals often feel the competing motivations of making bad versus good decisionsâa tension that often lies front-and-center in scenarios primed for behavioral public economics research.</p>

      <itunes:summary>In the world of economics, researchers at Microsoft are examining a range of complex systemsâfrom those that impact the technologies we use to those that inform the laws and policies we createâthrough the lens of a social science that goes beyond the numbers to better understand people and society.
Interviewed by Senior Principal ResearcherÂ Hunt Allcott (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hallcott/), EconomistÂ David Rothschild (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/davidmr/) discusses how the news media has evolved alongside social media and the internet, from story development to distribution of news via aggregators and wire services. Rothschild illuminates how and where people are consuming news and shares some of the strategies heâs seeing news outlets use to appeal to their audiences. He also covers research insights into media bias, misinformation, and how this knowledge could inform the future of news for the better. In addition, the researchers talk about Rothschildâs work withÂ Project Ratio (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-ratio/), which looks at how the news ecosystem impacts public opinion and political polarization while providing a multi-faceted approach to understanding these outcomes through data and infrastructure.

Today, in a wide-ranging interview, Kevin shares his insights on both the history and the future of computing, talks about how his impulse to celebrate the extraordinary people âbehind the techâ led to an eponymous non-profit organization and a podcast, andâ¦ reveals the superpower he got when he was in grad school.

<p>You may not know who Dr. Andrew Fitzgibbon is, but if youâve watched a TV show or movie in the last two decades, youâve probably seen some of his work. An expert in 3D computer vision and graphics, and head of the new All Data AI group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, Dr. Fitzgibbon was instrumental in the development of Boujou, an Emmy Award-winning 3D camera tracker that lets filmmakers place virtual props, like the floating candles in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, into live-action footage. But that was just his warm-up act.</p>
<p>On todayâs podcast, Dr. Fitzgibbon tells us what heâs been working on since the Emmys in 2002, including body- and hand-tracking for powerhouse Microsoft technologies like Kinect for Xbox 360 and HoloLens, explains how research on dolphins helped build mathematical models for the human hand, and reminds us, once again, that the âsecret sauceâ to most innovation is often just good, old-fashioned hard work.</p>

<p>Emotions are fundamental to human interaction, but in a world where humans are increasingly interacting with AI systems, Dr. Mary Czerwinski, Principal Researcher and Research Manager of the Visualization and Interaction for Business and Entertainment group at Microsoft Research, believes emotions may be fundamental to our interactions with machines as well.

<p>Today, Dr. Czerwinski tells us how a cognitive psychologist found her way into the research division of the worldâs largest software company, suggests that rather than trying to be productive 24/7, we should aim for Emotional Homeostasis instead, and tells us how, if we do it right, our machines could become a sort of âemotional at-work DJ,â sensing and responding to our emotional states, and helping us to become happier and more productive at the same time.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Behnaz Arzani is a senior researcher in the Mobility and Networking group at MSR, and she feels your pain. At least, that is, if youâre a network operator trying to troubleshoot an incident in a datacenter. Her research is all about getting networks to manage themselves, so your life is as pain-free as possible.</p>
<p>On todayâs podcast, Dr. Arzani tells us why itâs so hard to identify and resolve networking problems and then explains how content-aware, or domain-customized, auto ML frameworks might help. She also tells us what she means when she says she wants to get humans out of the loop, and reveals how a competitive streak and a comment from her high school principal set her on the path to a career in high tech research.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode originally aired in May, 2019.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn by observing the world, recognizing patterns and self-training via experience. Much like humans. But while machines perform well when they can extract knowledge from large amounts of labeled data, their learning outcomes remain vastly inferior to humans when data is limited. Thatâs why Dr. Patrice Simard, Distinguished Engineer and head of the Machine Teaching group at Microsoft, is using actual teachers to help machines learn, and enable them to extract knowledge from humans rather than just data.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Simard tells us why he believes any task you can teach to a human, you should be able to teach to a machine; explains how machines can exploit the human ability to decompose and explain concepts to train ML models more efficiently and less expensively; and gives us an innovative vision of how, when a human teacher and a machine learning model work together in a real-time interactive process, domain experts can leverage the power of machine learning without machine learning expertise.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Deep learning methodologies like supervised learning have been very successful in training machines to make predictions about the world. But because theyâre so dependent upon large amounts of human-annotated data, theyâve been difficult to scale.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thereâs a lot of excitement around self-driving cars, delivery drones, and other intelligent, autonomous systems, but before they can be deployed at scale, they need to be both reliable and safe. Thatâs why Gurdeep Pall, CVP of Business AI at Microsoft, and Dr. Ashish Kapoor, who leads research in Aerial Informatics and Robotics, are using a simulated environment called AirSim to reduce the time, cost and risk of the testing necessary to get autonomous agents ready for the open world.</p>
<p>Today, Gurdeep and Ashish discuss life at the intersection of machine learning, simulation and autonomous systems, and talk about the challenges we face as we transition from a world of automation to a world of autonomy. They also tell us about Game of Drones, an exciting new drone racing competition where the goal is to imbue flying robots with human-level perception and decision making skillsâ¦ on the fly.</p>

<p>On todayâs podcast, Tom and Teddy talk about physical computing through platforms like MakeCode, a simplified programming environment that makes it easier for young people â and other computer science neophytes â to start coding with programmable microcontrollers.

Well, weâre now in an era where peta-, exa- and even zetta-bytes are the bytes of the day, and it turns out itâs hard to fit that many zeroes on a hard drive. Thatâs where Dr. Ant Rowstron, Deputy Lab Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and Mark Russinovich, Chief Technical Officer of Azure, come in. Their respective teams are working on paradigm-breaking solutions to give us phenomenal storage power in an itty-bitty living space.</p>
<p>Today, Ant and Mark discuss their roles in the development of new optical technologies, like Project Silica, for cloud-scale storage demands, and talk about the Optics for the Cloud Research Alliance, an exciting new collaboration between academic researchers and MSR. They also explain how just the right mix of innovation and engineering can make the cloud more powerful and less expensive to use and, at the same time, deliver âforeverâ storage thatâs both dishwasher and microwave safe!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The ability to read and understand unstructured text, and then answer questions about it, is a common skill among literate humans. But for machines? Not so much. At least not yet! And not if Dr. T.J. Hazen, Senior Principal Research Manager in the Engineering and Applied Research group at MSR Montreal, has a say.

<p>On todayâs podcast, Dr. Hazen talks about why reading comprehension is so hard for machines, gives us an inside look at the technical approaches applied researchers and their engineering colleagues are using to tackle the problem, and shares the story of how an a-ha moment with a Rubikâs Cube inspired a career in computer science and a quest to teach computers to answer complex, text-based questions in the real world.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In an era of unprecedented advances in AI and machine learning, current gen systems and networks are being challenged by an unprecedented level of complexity and cost. Fortunately, Dr. Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, a researcher in the Mobility and Networking group at MSR, is up for a challenge. And, it seems, the more computationally intractable the better! A prolific researcher whoâs interested in all aspects of systems and networking, heâs on a particular quest to extract value from live video feeds and develop âkiller appsâ that will have a practical impact on the world.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Ananthanarayanan tells us all about Video Analytics for Vision Zero (an award-winning âkiller appâ that aims to reduce traffic-related fatalities to zero), gives us a wide-angle view of his work in geo-distributed data analytics and client-cloud networking, and explains how the duration and difficulty of a Test Cricket match provides an invaluable lesson for success in life and research.</p>

But Dr. Simon Peyton Jones would like to remind us that computer programs, with hundreds of millions of lines of code, are actually among the largest structures human beings have ever built. A principle researcher at the Microsoft Research Lab in Cambridge, England, co-developer of the programming language Haskell, and a Fellow of Britainâs Royal Society, Simon Peyton Jones has dedicated his life to this very particular kind of construction work.Today, Dr. Peyton Jones shares his passion for functional programming research, reveals how a desire to help other researchers write and present better turned him into an unlikely YouTube star, and explains why, at least in the world of programming languages, purity is embarrassing, laziness is cool, and success should be avoided at all costs.</p>

Thereâs a big gap between memory and storage, and Dr. Anirudh Badam, of the Systems Research Group at Microsoft Research, wants to close it. With projects like Navamem, which explores how systems can get faster and better by adopting new memory technologies, and HashCache, which brings with it the promise of storage for the next billion, he just might do it.Today, Dr. Badam discusses the historic trade-offs between volatile and non-volatile memory, shares how software-defined batteries are changing the power-supply landscape, talks about how his research is aiming for the trifecta of speed, cost and capacity in new memory technologies, and reminds us, once again, how one good high school physics teacher can inspire the next generation of scientific discovery.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If youâre like me, youâre no longer amazed by how all your technologies can work for you. Rather, youâve begun to take for granted that they simply should work for you. Instantly. All together. All the time. The fact that youâre not amazed is a testimony to the work that people like Dr. Lidong Zhou, Assistant Managing Director of Microsoft Research Asia, do every day. He oversees some of the cutting-edge systems and networking research that goes on behind the scenes to make sure youâre not amazed when your technologies work together seamlessly but rather, can continue to take it for granted that they will!</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Zhou talks about systems and networking research in an era of unprecedented systems complexity and what happens when old assumptions donât apply to new systems, explains how projects like CloudBrain are taking aim at real-time troubleshooting to address cloud-scale, network-related problems like âgray failure,â and tells us why he believes now is the most exciting time to be a systems and networking researcher.</p>]]></description>

An expert in 3D computer vision and graphics, and head of the new All Data AI group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, Dr. Fitzgibbon was instrumental in the development of Boujou, an Emmy Award-winning 3D camera tracker that lets filmmakers place virtual props, like the floating candles in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, into live-action footage.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn by observing the world, recognizing patterns and self-training via experience. Much like humans. But while machines perform well when they can extract knowledge from large amounts of labeled data, their learning outcomes remain vastly inferior to humans when data is limited. Thatâs why Dr. Patrice Simard, Distinguished Engineer and head of the Machine Teaching group at Microsoft, is using actual teachers to help machines learn, and enable them to extract knowledge from humans rather than just data.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Simard tells us why he believes any task you can teach to a human, you should be able to teach to a machine; explains how machines can exploit the human ability to decompose and explain concepts to train ML models more efficiently and less expensively; and gives us an innovative vision of how, when a human teacher and a machine learning model work together in a real-time interactive process, domain experts can leverage the power of machine learning without machine learning expertise.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:summary>Dr. John Langford, a partner researcher in the Machine Learning group at Microsoft Research New York City, is a reinforcement learning expert who is working, in his own words, to solve machine learning. Rafah Hosn, also of MSR New York, is a principal program manager whoâs working to take that work to the world. If that sounds like big thinking in the Big Apple, well, New York City has always been a âgo big, or go homeâ kind of town, and MSR NYC is a âgo big, or go homeâ kind of lab.
Today, Dr. Langford explains why online reinforcement learning is critical to solving machine learning and how moving from the current foundation of a Markov decision process toward a contextual bandit future might be part of the solution. Rafah Hosn talks about why itâs important, from a business perspective, to move RL agents out of simulated environments and into the open world, and gives us an under-the-hood look at the product side of MSRâs âresearch, incubate, transferâ process, focusing on real world reinforcement learning which, at Microsoft, is now called Azure Cognitive Services Personalizer.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of relational databases, structured query language, or SQL, has long been King of the Queries, primarily because of its ubiquity and unparalleled performance. But many users prefer a mix of imperative programming, along with declarative SQL, because its user-defined functions (or UDFs) allow for good software engineering practices like modularity, readability and re-usability. Sadly, these benefits have traditionally come with a huge performance penalty, rendering them impractical in most situations. That bothered Dr. Karthik Ramachandra, a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft Research India, so heâs spent a great deal of his career working on improving an imperative complement to SQL in database systems.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Ramachandra gives us an overview of the historic trade-offs between declarative and imperative programming paradigms, tells us some fantastic stories, including The Tale of Two Engineers and The UDF Story, Parts 1 and 2, and introduces us to Froid â thatâs F-R-O-I-D, not the Austrian psychoanalyst â which is an extensible, language-agnostic framework for optimizing imperative functions in databases, offering the benefits of UDFs without sacrificing performance.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If youâve ever played video games, you know that for the most part, they look a lot better than they sound. Thatâs largely due to the fact that audible sound waves are much longer â and a lot more crafty â than visual light waves, and therefore, much more difficult to replicate in simulated environments. But Dr. Nikunj Raghuvanshi, a Senior Researcher in the Interactive Media Group at Microsoft Research, is working to change that by bringing the quality of game audio up to speed with the quality of game video. He wants you to hear how sound really travels â in rooms, around corners, behind walls, out doors â and heâs using computational physics to do it.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Raghuvanshi talks about the unique challenges of simulating realistic sound on a budget (both money and CPU), explains how classic ideas in concert hall acoustics need a fresh take for complex games like Gears of War, reveals the computational secret sauce you need to deliver the right sound at the right time, and tells us about Project Triton, an acoustic system that models how real sound waves behave in 3-D game environments to makes us believe with our ears as well as our eyes.</p>]]></description>

While these cells are robust, theyâre also extraordinarily complex and not altogether predictable. Wouldnât it be great, asks Dr. Andrew Phillips, head of the Biological Computation Group at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, if we could figure out exactly how these building blocks of life work and harness their power with the rigor and predictability of computer science?

<p>You know those people who work behind the scenes to make sure nothing bad happens to you, and if theyâre really good, you never know who they are because nothing bad happens to you? Well, meet one of those people. Dr. Brian LaMacchia is a Distinguished Engineer and he heads up the Security and Cryptography Group at Microsoft Research. Itâs his job to make sure â using up-to-the-minute math â that youâre safe and secure online, both now, and in the post-quantum world to come.Today, Dr. LaMacchia gives us an inside look at the world of cryptography and the number theory behind it, explains what happens when good algorithms go bad, and tells us why, even though cryptographically relevant quantum computers are still decades away, we need to start developing quantum-resistant algorithms right now.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The entertainment industry has long offered us a vision of the perfect personal assistant: one that not only meets our stated needs but anticipates needs we didnât even know we had. But these uber-assistants, from the preternaturally prescient Radar OâReilly in the TV show M.A.S.H. to Tony Starkâs digital know-and-do-it-all Jarvis in Iron Man, have always lived in the realm of fiction or science fiction. That could all change, if Dr. Paul Bennett, Principal Researcher and Research Manager of the Information and Data Sciences group at Microsoft Research, has anything to say about it. He and his team are working to make machines âcalendar and email aware,â moving intelligent assistance into the realm of science and onto your workstation.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Bennett brings us up to speed on the science of contextually intelligent assistants, explains how what we think our machines can do actually shapes what we expect them to do, and shares how current research in machine learning and data science is helping machines reason on our behalf in the quest to help us find the right information effortlessly.</p>]]></description>

<p>The ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius famously exhorted his pupils to study the past if they would divine the future. In 2018, we get the same advice from a decidedly more modern, but equally philosophical Bill Buxton, Principal Researcher in the HCI group at Microsoft Research. In addition to his pioneering work in computer science and design, Bill Buxton has spent the past several decades amassing a collection of more than a thousand artifacts that chronicle the history of human computer interaction for the very purpose of informing the future of human computer interaction.</p>
<p>Today, in a wide-ranging interview, Bill Buxton explains why Marcel Proust and TS Eliot can be instructive for computer scientists, why the long nose of innovation is essential to success in technology design, why problem-setting is more important than problem-solving, and why we must remember, as we design our technologies, that every technological decision we make is an ethical decision as well.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Nancy Baym is a communication scholar, a Principal Researcher in MSRâs Cambridge, Massachusetts, lab, and something of a cyberculture maven. Sheâs spent nearly three decades studying how people use communication technologies in their everyday relationships and written several books on the subject. The big take away? Communication technologies may have changed drastically over the years, but human communication itself? Not so much.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Baym shares her insights on a host of topics ranging from the arduous maintenance requirements of social media, to the dialectic tension between connection and privacy, to the funhouse mirror nature of emerging technologies. She also talks about her new book, Playing to the Crowd: Musicians, Audiences and the Intimate Work of Connection, which explores how the internet transformed â for better and worse â the relationship between artists and their fans.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Datacenters have a hard time keeping their cool. Literally. And with more and more datacenters coming online all over the world, calls for innovative solutions to âcool the cloudâ are getting loud. So, Ben Cutler and the Special Projects team at Microsoft Research decided to try to beat the heat by using one of the best natural venues for cooling off on the planet: the ocean. That led to Project Natick, Microsoftâs prototype plan to deploy a new class of eco-friendly datacenters, under water, at scale, anywhere in the world, from decision to power-on, in 90 days. Because, presumably for Special Projects, go big or go home.</p>
<p>In todayâs podcast we find out a bit about what else the Special Projects team is up to, and then we hear all about Project Natick and how Ben and his team conceived of, and delivered on, a novel idea to deal with the increasing challenges of keeping datacenters cool, safe, green, and, now, dry as well!</p>]]></description>

If someone mentions quantum computing, and you find yourself outwardly nodding your head, but secretly shaking it, youâre in good company: some of the worldâs smartest people admit they donât really understand it either. Fortunately, some of the worldâs other smartest people, like Dr. Krysta Svore, Principal Research Manager of the Microsoft Quantum â or QuArC â group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, actually DO understand quantum computing, and are working hard to make it a reality.Today, Dr. Svore shares her passion for quantum algorithms and their potential to solve some of the worldâs biggest problems, explains why Microsoftâs topological quantum bit â or qubit â is a game changer for quantum computing, and assures us that, although qubits live in dilution refrigerators at temperatures near absolute zero, quantum researchers can still sit in the comfort of their offices and work with the computer programmerâs equivalent of Schroedingerâs Cat.</p>]]></description>

Fortunately, some of the worldâs other smartest people, like Dr. Krysta Svore, Principal Research Manager of the Microsoft Quantum â or QuArC â group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, actually DO understand quantum computing, and are working hard to make it a reality.<br /><br />Today, Dr. Svore shares her passion for quantum algorithms and their potential to solve some of the worldâs biggest problems, explains why Microsoftâs topological quantum bit â or qubit â is a game changer for quantum computing, and assures us that, although qubits live in dilution refrigerators at temperatures near absolute zero, quantum researchers can still sit in the comfort of their offices and work with the computer programmerâs equivalent of Schroedingerâs Cat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>First aired on December 4th, 2017. When it comes to artificial intelligence, Dr. Eric Horvitz is as passionate as he is accomplished. His contributions to the field, and service on the boards of nearly every technical academy and association in the country, have earned him the respect â and awe â of his colleagues, along with the position of Technical Fellow and Managing Director of Microsoft Research. Dr. Horvitz talks about the goal of artificial intelligence, his vision for our collaborative future with machines, what we can learn from the Wright brothers, and how a short stint of âsix months, maximumâ became an illustrious and, in his words, joyful, 25-year career at Microsoft Research.</p>]]></description>
