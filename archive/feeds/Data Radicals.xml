    <title>Data Radicals</title>
    <description>Some people can see things that nobody else can. They seem to be able to peer around corners and into the future. These seemingly super powers come from being able to synthesize the data all around us. They approach problems with a curious and rational mind. They think differently and encourage others to embrace data culture.

We call them “data radicals” because they transform themselves and the world around them

In this podcast, we talk to these Data Radicals to understand what makes their approach so unique and how it can be replicated.</description>

      <title>Delegate to Innovate: How Letting Go Makes You a Better Leader with Todd James, Founder &amp; CEO of Aurora Insights</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>What does it take to turn AI hype into operational value at enterprise scale?</p><p>In this episode of <i>Data Radicals</i>, host Satyen Sangani sits down with Todd James, former Chief Data and Technology Officer at 84.51° and Kroger executive, to unpack the realities of leading AI transformation inside one of America’s largest grocery retailers.</p><p>Drawing on a career that spans the Coast Guard, consulting, and Fortune 100 leadership, Todd shares how scaling AI isn’t just about building advanced algorithms—it’s about solving real problems, embedding with the business, and building reusable infrastructure that lasts.</p><p>“If the people at the consumption end of your sciences aren’t bought in, they don’t get implemented.”</p><p>Listen to this episode to learn:</p><ul><li>How effective leaders “delegate to innovate” and create space for team growth<br /> </li><li>How AI reduced Kroger’s pick-order travel time by 10% and truck route distance by 8.6%<br /> </li><li>Why the CDO role is likely transitional—and what’s next for data leadership<br /> </li><li>What it takes to embed data science into the operational core of a business<br /><br /> </li></ul><p>This conversation is a must-listen for anyone building AI programs, leading data teams, or navigating digital transformation.</p><p>Listen now:<a href="https://www.alation.com/podcast/episodes/delegate-innovate-todd-james"> https://www.alation.com/podcast/episodes/delegate-innovate-todd-james</a></p><p>*Satyen’s narration was created using AI</p><p>--------</p><p>“ I think we should go into every project, every initiative, saying, ‘I own an outcome around bringing people along and convincing them.’ If you're doing that right, you're probably spending more than half of the project or half the initiative on managing those organizational dynamics.

      <itunes:summary>Generative AI is reshaping the way go-to-market teams create content, optimize workflows, and drive velocity — but only when it’s powered by the right context and data.

In this episode of Data Radicals, Alation CMO David Chao sits down with Paul Yacoubian, CEO and co-founder of Copy.ai, to explore how large language models (LLMs) are transforming content creation and sales execution at scale. Paul shares lessons from building Copy.ai since 2020 and how his team is helping over 15 million users streamline operations through AI-powered automation.

You’ll learn why content without context falls flat, how siloed systems slow down GTM execution, and why AI isn’t replacing roles — it’s augmenting them to unlock new levels of efficiency and insight.

Listen to this episode to learn:
How LLMs enable end-to-end automation by taking in data, executing workflows, and generating outputs — without manual bottlenecks.
Why unifying siloed systems is critical to improving GTM velocity, content relevancy, and business decision-making.
How AI is transforming — not replacing — roles like SDRs and marketers, and what that means for the future of sales teams.
What CEOs and business leaders must do to operationalize AI successfully: from standardizing best practices to enabling faster, data-driven decisions.

If you&apos;re navigating the challenges of scaling AI in your GTM org — from data sprawl to inefficient workflows — this episode offers practical strategies, fresh perspectives, and a blueprint for AI-powered transformation.</itunes:summary>

Paul shares lessons from building Copy.ai since 2020 and how his team is helping over 15 million users streamline operations through AI-powered automation.

You’ll learn why content without context falls flat, how siloed systems slow down GTM execution, and why AI isn’t replacing roles — it’s augmenting them to unlock new levels of efficiency and insight.

Listen to this episode to learn:
How LLMs enable end-to-end automation by taking in data, executing workflows, and generating outputs — without manual bottlenecks.
Why unifying siloed systems is critical to improving GTM velocity, content relevancy, and business decision-making.
How AI is transforming — not replacing — roles like SDRs and marketers, and what that means for the future of sales teams.
What CEOs and business leaders must do to operationalize AI successfully: from standardizing best practices to enabling faster, data-driven decisions.

If you&apos;re navigating the challenges of scaling AI in your GTM org — from data sprawl to inefficient workflows — this episode offers practical strategies, fresh perspectives, and a blueprint for AI-powered transformation.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Redesigning Processes for the Age of AI Agents with Tom Davenport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>AI is here—but are businesses truly ready to harness its full potential? In this episode of <i>Data Radicals</i>, host Satyen Sangani sits down with Tom Davenport to explore what it takes for AI to create real business value.</p><p>As one of the most respected voices in AI and analytics, Tom brings decades of expertise to the table. From agentic AI to AI-driven leadership, this conversation covers the pressing challenges—and opportunities—that will shape the next era of business transformation.</p><h3>What You'll Learn in This Episode:</h3><p>🔹 Agentic AI is still in its infancy – AI agents can act autonomously, but most businesses are only using them for simple, low-stakes tasks. Scaling their use requires overcoming reliability challenges.<br />🔹 AI alone won’t drive value—process redesign is critical – Businesses can’t just add AI to existing workflows and expect results. As Tom puts it, <i>"Economic value requires that we change the way we do our work. And there has to be some intentional design activity. It can't just evolve."</i><br />🔹 The C-suite is overcrowded—AI leadership must evolve – With CIOs, CDOs, CTOs, and more, organizations often suffer from fragmented leadership. Tom argues for business-driven executives who can oversee AI, data, and digital strategy holistically.</p><p>AI is transforming industries, but the organizations that truly succeed will be those that rethink their leadership, workflows, and data strategies. Whether you're a CDO, CIO, or data professional, this episode offers actionable insights from one of the most influential thinkers in AI and analytics.</p><p>*Satyen’s narration was created using AI</p><p>--------</p><p>“ There is a generative AI component, but it's not just generative AI.

There's lots of solutions and players that work in those components, but you can give basic guidelines to say, here's the steps and the processes and the pieces that you need to put in place.

Taylor offers time-tested strategies to help data and business leaders alike make a measurable impact.</p><p>--------</p><p>“What data leaders should just own is the path to me is probably going to be fraught with failure, but I need to be able to pivot and I need to be agile. I can very much serve myself by adhering to a common set of principles, which I'm going to practice consistently and continually adapt and adjust in the way I engage with my stakeholders and identify their problems and lean in or lean out on data management techniques or delivering certain solutions. It comes down to intent. Do you genuinely want to help people in your business solve problems with data? Do you genuinely want to grow? Do you genuinely recognize that there's not a magic bullet to doing this? Those are the data leaders who will be successful despite facing adversity.” – Taylor Culver</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Time Stamps</strong></p><p>*(07:01): The data-business people problem </p><p>*(17:50): How data leaders can tackle business problems in 3 steps</p><p>*(26:22): Is data a strategic function or an enablement function? </p><p>*(33:50): Strategy: Data offense vs. data defense</p><p>*(40:45): Data is a people business: the value of trust</p><p>*(46:20): Our takeaways</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Sponsor</strong></p><p>This podcast is presented by <a href="https://www.alation.com/">Alation</a>.</p><p>Learn more:</p><p>* Subscribe to the newsletter: <a href="https://www.alation.com/podcast/">https://www.alation.com/podcast/</a></p><p>* Alation’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/</a></p><p>* Satyen’s LinkedIn Profile: </p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/</a></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorculver/">Connect with Taylor on LinkedIn</a></p>

      <title>AI and the Workforce: Copilots or Competitors? with Jeremy Kahn, AI Editor at Fortune</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The transformative potential of AI is going to affect all of us, regardless of what industry you’re in. While AI has the capability to democratize high-demand professions through specialized copilots, it also presents potential positive and negative societal impacts, including misinformation and political discourse manipulation. Today, we’re taking an in-depth look at the evolution of AI copilots tailored for specific professional fields and the need for critical thinking and transparent AI systems to ensure ethical deployment and improved outcomes in sectors like healthcare and finance.</p><p>There’s a growing need for federal guidelines to prevent fragmented AI governance (think the EU AI Act). However, differing approaches to regulations across regions can lead to unbalanced directives. Politics are also influencing this new AI landscape. From potential deregulatory pushes under a Trump administration to sustained regulatory efforts under a Harris-led government, AI regulation will look different depending on who wins the US election. And it’s not just politics, total war is a significant worry when it comes to the use of AI. From military strategies to disrupting democracy, AI has the power to impact innovation, ethics, politics, and society. Satyen sits down with Jeremy to discuss his book <i>Mastering AI</i>, the importance of AI regulations, and the impact of AI on the job market.</p><p>--------</p><p>“In the US, we have this issue where the states are starting to take action because of the lack of action by the federal government and I think that's problematic. I don't think you want a system where you have every state with its own AI act and different laws to comply with in every state. I do think we need to have some action at the federal level. When we're going to see that happen, I don't know, because there has been a lot of lack of will. Even though there was some bipartisan efforts in Congress that looked like they were maybe going to pay off last year. I think there's some agreement on both sides of the aisle that there should be some rules and regulation passed around AI.” – Jeremy Kahn</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Time Stamps</strong></p><p>*(02:37): The future of AI: A boon for the middle class, a threat to democracy</p><p>*(12:18): The case for federal AI regulation in the US</p><p>*(20:11): The impact of the US election on AI regulations</p><p>*(30:29): What is the Pigouvian or robot tax? </p><p>*(36:39): What is total war?

      <title>Gen AI at Work: Inside the Digital Bank Revolution with Dr. Geraldine Wong, CDO at GXS Bank</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Legacy systems in the financial services industry are notorious for being slower to adapt to big data. But for good reason. Because banks are complicated and intersect across networks, it’s difficult to implement new processes without disturbing the rest of the system. Yet, GXS Bank is proving it doesn’t have to be this way. The digital bank is leveraging data to drive financial inclusion and innovation. Their strategic use of data from parent companies and partnerships, helps create financial products for underserved communities in Singapore.</p><p>Not only is GXS Bank driving inclusion, but they’re also exploring the impact of generative AI on customer service, fraud detection, and operational efficiency. The technology is transforming the financial sector by offering valuable insights for improving data quality, governance, and stakeholder engagement. Satyen and Geraldine discuss the importance of creating better products and credit risk profiles, the intricacies of data sharing agreements and operational challenges, and strategies for leveraging AI to enhance customer service and fraud detection.</p><p>--------</p><p>“If you think about AI being part of a product manager, product creation, so you go to different segments of your consumers, see what their pain points are, do the summarization, and then say, ‘Hey, AI, can you create a new product that would match the needs of 50% of my segments in the consumer business?’ The AI quickly generates some AI product, a banking product for you with such features and you iterate and iterate and iterate. These are some of the tools that a product manager could really leverage on to create a new product from scratch.” – Gerladine Wong</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Time Stamps</strong></p><p>*(01:24): About GXS Bank</p><p>*(10:04): Gen AI at GXS</p><p>*(15:35): Supporting financial inclusion with alternative data sources</p><p>*(31:34): Playing data offense vs defense at GXS</p><p>*(40:51): Takeaways</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Sponsor</strong></p><p>This podcast is presented by <a href="https://www.alation.com/">Alation</a>.</p><p>Learn more:</p><p>* Subscribe to the newsletter: <a href="https://www.alation.com/podcast/">https://www.alation.com/podcast/</a></p><p>* Alation’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/</a></p><p>* Satyen’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/</a></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geraldine-wong-phd/">Connect with Geraldine on LinkedIn</a></p>

      <itunes:summary>Legacy systems in the financial services industry are notorious for being slower to adapt to big data. But for good reason. Because banks are complicated and intersect across networks, it’s difficult to implement new processes without disturbing the rest of the system. Yet, GXS Bank is proving it doesn’t have to be this way. The digital bank is leveraging data to drive financial inclusion and innovation. Their strategic use of data from parent companies and partnerships, helps create financial products for underserved communities in Singapore.

Not only is GXS Bank driving inclusion, but they’re also exploring the impact of generative AI on customer service, fraud detection, and operational efficiency.

      <title>The AI Echo of Saul Alinsky&apos;s Legacy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Saul Alinsky's book <i>Rules for Radicals</i> held significant lessons for grassroots movements and political activism when it was published in 1971. It also inspired the title and theme of this podcast. In his book, Saul outlines approaches for unifying people and motivating them to work toward a common goal. Today, these same strategies can be used for data culture change management, triggering transformative action within organizations. </p><p>Saul was an American activist and political theorist who lived from 1909 to 1972. His work organized impoverished communities and gave them tools to drive social change, and won him national attention and notability. In the final episode of the season, Satyen sits down with a ChatGPT-infused version of Saul to discuss the role of data in driving social change, the application of community organization tactics in corporate settings, and the key principles from <i>Rules for Radicals</i>.</p><p>--------</p><p>“On the global stage, data analytics and humanitarian efforts is akin to having a crystal ball. It's not about predicting the future, but about making informed, timely decisions that can save lives. The possibilities are indeed limitless. With data and analytics, we're not just changing the game. We're rewriting the rules and designing a better playbook for humanity.” – Saul GP Talinsky</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>*(03:57): Bridging community organizing with data science</p><p>*(12:46): Empowering teams: Upskilling organizational agility</p><p>*(14:35): Democratizing data and crafting a culture of insight and empowerment</p><p>*(17:17): The timeless role of data in driving social change</p><p>*(20:54): How to unlock societal transformation with data and analytics</p><p>*(26:26): The evolution of radical change</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Sponsor</strong></p><p>This podcast is presented by <a href="https://www.alation.com/">Alation</a>.</p><p>Learn more:</p><p>* Subscribe to the newsletter: <a href="https://www.alation.com/podcast/">https://www.alation.com/podcast/</a></p><p>* Alation’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/</a></p><p>* Satyen’s LinkedIn Profile: </p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/</a></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Radicals-Practical-Primer-Realistic/dp/0679721134">Read <i>Rules for Radicals</i></a></p>

Right now, teams are struggling to store it, process it on a daily basis. Teams that could do that faster will be an advantage. For listeners, if you're not in the baseball world, same idea.

      <title>Everything You Wanted To Know About LLMs, but Were Too Afraid To Ask with Matthew Lynley, Founding Writer of Supervised</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With the rise of GenAI, LLMs are now accessible to everyone. They start with a very easy learning curve that grows more complicated the deeper you go. But, not all models are created equal.

      <title>Measuring the (Data) Culture of Medicine with Dr. Bapu Jena, Joseph P. Newhouse Professor at Harvard Medical School</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The art of medicine happens when physicians combine data and knowledge to deliver better patient outcomes. A physician that relies both on guidelines and their learned experience is creating a culture of data and insights and improving the lives of patients. Whether you’re a doctor or a data leader, knowing how to balance data and intuition will always drive better results.</p><p>Dr. Bapu Jena is an economist, physician, and Joseph P. Newhouse Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School. He bridges his professions to explore the economics of healthcare productivity and medical innovation. Satyen and Bapu discuss leveraging data in healthcare, applying AI in medicine, and measuring the innovation of doctors.</p><p>--------</p><p>“We have put a premium on the innovativeness of the technology. There could be a new molecule that attacks a pathway that has never been attacked before. If that molecule doesn't improve life expectancy or improve quality of life, then there's not a lot of value to me in that innovation, even though it's certainly innovative. I care more about whether or not it impacts patients' lives. The correlator to that is that you could have a medication which does not appear to be that quote, unquote, ‘innovative,’ at all because it's just a reboot, in some respect, of other medications. But, it's taken in a way that people are more likely to be adherent to. Those types of technologies are sometimes pooh-poohed on, but they could be very valuable because what ultimately matters is the outcome of whether or not a person gets better when they're on that medication, not how innovative it is. This is also a problem when it comes to data-driven interventions, as well. Because, there's a lot of interest in AI and non-medical technologies, or non-life science technologies.

They work with the business sponsors to identify what are the one or two or three most important things to them and see if they can solve those questions, even if it’s with a very small subset of data, to begin to develop that relationship, that trust.” – Randy Bean, Author of <i>Fail Fast, Learn Faster</i></p><p>“You have to be able to have a learner’s mindset.

His blog, Kellblog, is a highly regarded content hub for software leaders, drawing on his experience as an angel investor, board member, advisor, and thought leader. Satyen and Dave discuss the evolution of the data industry, problem solving with frameworks, and mapping your business in a complicated world.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Perfect is The Enemy of The Good with Ameen Kazerouni, CTO at Orange Theory Fitness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re on a journey of fitness, you know that perfectionism is your enemy. The same goes for data. There will always be another achievement that you wish to reach. Instead, focus on creating habits that will lead you to better data decisions and long term health.</p><p>Ameen Kazerouni knows this journey well. Ameen has spent his career at the intersection of science, data, and technology to create intuitive, data-driven experiences. In his role as CTO of Orangetheory Fitness, he is driving consumer wellness journeys by turning workout data into feedback and personalized recommendations. In this episode, Satyen and Ameen discuss data-driven exercise, keeping humans in the feedback loop, and AI data governance.</p><p>--------</p><p>“We make a lot of investment in demystifying the Orangetheory workout. And there's a lot of parallels to data, and I love that because when you think about data in an organization, ‘Well, it's going to be a multimillion dollar investment.’ And it can get so overwhelming that instead of being like, ‘Let's start piece by piece,’ the instinct becomes, ‘Let's just keep guessing instead.’ Which is never a good idea. You should never, ‘Let's just revert to not using data at all because it's going to be really difficult to use data perfectly.’ It's the same thing with fitness. You don't revert to doing nothing at all because meeting all the requirements will be hard.

      <title>Don’t Say Data Literacy with Wendy Batchelder, CDO &amp; SVP, Global Data Governance at Salesforce</title>

In her current role at Salesforce, Wendy is helping the right people access the right data at the right time — with the right controls.

If you're trying to help people to use more data for decision making, then just introduce the data.

      <title>Building the Company You Wish You Could Buy From with Mike Capone, CEO of Qlik</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>As folks in the data space, we’re introverts by nature. But, getting out of our comfort zone can open you up to endless possibilities. As one person who’s gone from CIO to CEO can tell you, the key to growth is getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>That person is Mike Capone, CEO of Qlik, where he’s revolutionizing the business intelligence landscape through data. In this episode, Mike shares with Satyen how his decades of experience in product development, data science, and go-to-market operations influence his role as CEO today. Satyen and Mike discuss transitioning from CIO to CEO, navigating economic downturns, and stepping out of your comfort zone.</p><p>--------</p><p>“Now is the time to get closer to your best customers. They're the ones who sustain you through these periods of economic ups and downs. The reality is for both of us and both of our companies, companies need data and analytics now more than ever.

And then the bazaar is the open thing. You don't know who's going to show up each day, but there'll be some really interesting goods and things that you just wouldn't see anywhere else.

      <title>From the Outskirts to the Center with Jitendra Putcha, EVP &amp; Global Head of Data Analytics &amp; AI at LTIMindtree</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Once considered the outcast of Silicon Valley, data has metamorphosed as a cool kid that everyone wants to be friends with. In the last decade, data has solidified itself as the key to success in business. The same shift can be said for India who primarily operated behind the scenes, has emerged as a leader in innovation.</p><p>In this episode, Satyen sits down with Jitendra Putcha, EVP and Global Head of Data, Analytics, and AI at LTIMindtree. As an industry leader for over 20 years, he has solved data and analytics challenges for global companies by creating innovative next-generation solutions. Satyen and Jitendra discuss data platform modernization, data quality initiatives, and the future of AI and data science.</p><p>--------</p><p>“Gone are the days of looking at India as the back office and factory models, to looking at this is an opportunity. There are two, three reasons for it. One reason is about the startup ecosystem and the unicorns we started building, created aspirations for people and created curiosity for individuals even during school itself. Which wasn't the case a couple of decades back. That's one. The second is the promotion during school itself to encourage people to be driving incubation startups and throw their ideas has dramatically increased, there are many forums today. So, that's the second one. The third one, even the large SIs like us, today we have what we call entrepreneurs. Within our own ecosystem, people can come out with an idea, put an entire canvas and business plan, go to the board, get the funding, create that as an incubator, and go and test the market. If it is working, create that as an entire product line. I think when the young generation is able to get exposure, already been educated, and also they see in their workplace this kind of opportunity, I think that's the biggest benefit the younger generation is able to do, which probably wasn't the case before.” – Jitendra Putcha</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Time Stamps:</strong></p><p>*(09:57): The evolution of service providers</p><p>*(13:22): The transformation of the Indian talent base</p><p>*(30:52): The data marketplace and “data as a service”</p><p>*(46:35): Defining the ROI of data tools</p><p>*(53:17): Satyen’s Takeaways</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Sponsor</strong></p><p>This podcast is presented by <a href="https://www.alation.com/">Alation</a>.</p><p>Learn more:</p><p>* Subscribe to the newsletter: <a href="https://www.alation.com/podcast/">https://www.alation.com/podcast/</a></p><p>* Alation’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/</a></p><p>* Satyen’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/</a></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jitendraputcha/?originalSubdomain=in">Follow Jitendra on LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pjchakri?lang=en">Follow Jitendra on Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/summit/">Learn more about Snowflake Summit</a></p>

There are two, three reasons for it. One reason is about the startup ecosystem and the unicorns we started building, created aspirations for people and created curiosity for individuals even during school itself. Which wasn't the case a couple of decades back. That's one. The second is the promotion during school itself to encourage people to be driving incubation startups and throw their ideas has dramatically increased, there are many forums today. So, that's the second one. The third one, even the large SIs like us, today we have what we call entrepreneurs. Within our own ecosystem, people can come out with an idea, put an entire canvas and business plan, go to the board, get the funding, create that as an incubator, and go and test the market. If it is working, create that as an entire product line. I think when the young generation is able to get exposure, already been educated, and also they see in their workplace this kind of opportunity, I think that's the biggest benefit the younger generation is able to do, which probably wasn't the case before.” – Jitendra Putcha</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Time Stamps:</strong></p><p>*(09:57): The evolution of service providers</p><p>*(13:22): The transformation of the Indian talent base</p><p>*(30:52): The data marketplace and “data as a service”</p><p>*(46:35): Defining the ROI of data tools</p><p>*(53:17): Satyen’s Takeaways</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Sponsor</strong></p><p>This podcast is presented by <a href="https://www.alation.com/">Alation</a>.</p><p>Learn more:</p><p>* Subscribe to the newsletter: <a href="https://www.alation.com/podcast/">https://www.alation.com/podcast/</a></p><p>* Alation’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/alation/</a></p><p>* Satyen’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangani/</a></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jitendraputcha/?originalSubdomain=in">Follow Jitendra on LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pjchakri?lang=en">Follow Jitendra on Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/summit/">Learn more about Snowflake Summit</a></p>

Last season, we heard from industry leaders, journalists, analysts, and founders. They gave expert advice for using data to navigate any struggle: from overhauling your company’s governance strategy… to even getting a date!

These data radicals see things that nobody else can. And this next season is no different. We have incredible guests lined up who will give you the tools you need to bring your business – and career – to the next level. 

We’re welcoming guests like: Tim Harford, of the BBC’s More or Less; Jonathan Reichental, Author of Data Governance for Dummies; Mike Capone, CEO of Qlik (and Talend), Ameen Kazerouni, CTO of OrangeTheory, and so many more.

      <title>Forging a Culture of Data Governance with Bob Seiner, President &amp; Principal, KIK Consulting</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Communication—or lack thereof—tends to be at the core of most of life’s issues.

Bob Seiner, President & Principal of KIK Consulting, on the other hand, has had more success.

      <itunes:summary>Data confers immense power. With it, we can transform the world as we know it. But, despite all that potential—too few people know how to wield data. 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day. Saul Alinsky famously said “If people don’t think they have the power to solve their problems, they won’t even think about how to solve them.” Translating that information into meaning is one of the most significant challenges of our time. We believe it’s the key to addressing our most pressing issues, from climate change to global inequality.  Many of us see this as an opportunity: How do we teach more people to leverage data?  

This show is called Data Radicals, hosted by Satyen Sangani, CEO of Alation. Join us on this journey as we engage data leaders, academics and analysts from all walks of life. We’ll be featuring the stories of the culture builders and truth-seekers who are doing big things with data. Whether you’re a Chief Data Officer, a young data analyst on the path to the C-suite, or a data fanatic who wants to learn from today’s change makers - this podcast is for you.
