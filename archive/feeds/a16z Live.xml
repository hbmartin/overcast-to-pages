      <description><![CDATA[To celebrate the L.A. community and the city's growth, a16z recently hosted, "Time to Build Los Angeles," an event where we invited L.A.-based investors, founders, and operators from across a diverse range of industries to talk about company building in L.A. In the first in our series of interviews, we invited Andrew Chen from a16z, Minnie Ingersoll from TenOneTen, and Turner Novak from Banana Capital to talk about why L.A. is at an inflection point, misperceptions about the region, and what makes a great meme. But first, we opened our panel discussion with a presentation from a16z consumer partner, Katia Ameri, on what you need to know about the L.A. scene and why we think it's worth paying attention to in the years to come. What follows is a slightly edited version of that conversation.

      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of a16z Live, we are joined by Titan Invest co-founder and co-CEO Clayton Gardner; a16z General Partner Anish Acharya; and a16z growth partner, Alex Immerman. The trio starts their conversation by diving into the difference between active and passive investment management and where Titan fits into that matrix. Building upon that foundation, they discuss how the fintech market is changing, why historically the best fund managers have not taken retail money, and whether that's changing the importance of curation in UX on competitive platforms, and of course the role of regulation.

      <title>Beating the Incumbents with Michael Ovitz on Boss Talk #9</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Ben and Marc started a16z, CAA and its founder Michael Ovitz served as inspiration for how to break into an industry dominated by a few large incumbents. In 1975, a few large talent agencies dominated the entertainment industry. To break into the industry, Michael and CAA came up with a new playbook — rather than a single agent representing an actor or actress, he turned the entire agency into a network.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What are the different types of failure? Which can (and can’t) we come back from? And what does it take to turn failure into a comeback story?</p><p>The second episode of “4B with Margit” explores failure and comebacks with Suneel Gupta, once a poster child for failure, featured in the <i>New York Times </i>and on the keynote stage of FailCon, whose new book <i>Backable</i> is a study in turning failure into success. Also joining the conversation is Eugene Soltes, Harvard Business School professor and author of <i>Why They Do It: Inside the Mind of the White-Collar Criminal; </i>Ash Spiegelberg, a partner at the Brunswick Group specializing corporate reputation and crisis management; and Carlye Adler, the Silicon Valley ghostwriter who helped Suneel with <i>Backable</i>.</p><p>“4B with Margit” is a Clubhouse show for raw and unfiltered advice from comms and marketing experts who have seen it all, as well as insider stories from the builders and pioneers who were in the trenches. Think “Scandal” meets “Halt and Catch Fire.” Catch it live Wednesdays 4-5 PST.  </p>
