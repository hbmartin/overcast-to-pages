      <title>865: How to Grow (and Sell) a Data Science Consultancy, with Cal Al-Dhubaib</title>
      <link>https://www.superdatascience.com/865</link>
      <description>Jon Krohn talks to Cal Al-Dhubaib about the extraordinary success of AI and machine learning solutions provider Pandata, his ironclad hack for any company to define their core values, and how to attract and secure loyal clients. Cal thinks tech professionals make two critical mistakes in their careers: The first is that they too-often enjoy being the gatekeepers of their work rather than educating their clients and coworkers as to the details of their projects and why it benefits the company. The second is that tech professionals don’t show vulnerability, whether that means not knowing a topic or not fully understanding how a business works. This issue, Cal says, can spell the difference between a startup’s success and failure. Learn how tech startups can make an ironclad strategy for their future in this episode of The SuperDataScience Podcast.

This episode is brought to you by ODSC, the Open Data Science Conference. Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode? Email natalie@superdatascience.com for sponsorship information.

In this episode you will learn:

(09:32) How to scale a successful data science consultancy

(22:25) How Pandata navigates highly regulated environments 

(27:59) How to tackle tech illiteracy in business 

(36:32) What skills Cals looks for in new hires 

(35:56) How to sell on a tech company

      <title>863: TabPFN: Deep Learning for Tabular Data (That Actually Works!), with Prof. Frank Hutter</title>
      <link>https://www.superdatascience.com/863</link>
      <description>Jon Krohn talks tabular data with Frank Hutter, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at Universität Freiburg in Germany. Despite the great steps that deep learning has made in analysing images, audio, and natural language, tabular data has remained its insurmountable obstacle. In this episode, Frank Hutter details the path he has found around this obstacle even with limited data by using a ground-breaking transformer architecture. Named TabPFN, this approach is vastly outperforming other architectures, as testified by a write up of TabPFN’s capabilities in Nature. Frank talks about his work on version 2 of TabPFN, the architecture’s cross-industry applicability, and how TabPFN is able to return accurate results with synthetic data.

This episode is brought to you by ODSC, the Open Data Science Conference. Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode? Email natalie@superdatascience.com for sponsorship information.

In this episode you will learn:

(05:57) All about the TabPFN architecture 

(21:27) Use cases for Bayesian inference

(35:07) On getting published in Nature

(44:03) How TabPFN handles time series data

(51:52) All about Prior Labs

      <title>724: Decoding Speech from Raw Brain Activity, with Dr. David Moses</title>
      <description>In this Friday episode, host Jon Krohn talks to UCSF’s David Moses about BRAVO (Brain-Computer Interface Restoration of Arm and Voice), a study led by Edward Chang and Karunesh Ganguly that helps patients who have lost the ability to speak to communicate once again via a speech neuroprosthesis. Postdoctoral engineer David Moses, who is a part of BRAVO, reveals the data and machine learning models that help BRAVO predict the words and facial expressions that a paralyzed patient is trying to form via their brain activity, crucially helping patients to communicate with medical practitioners and loved ones.Additional materials: www.superdatascience.com/724Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?

      <title>674: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)</title>
      <description>Models like Alpaca, Vicuña, GPT4All-J and Dolly 2.0 have relatively small model architectures, but they're prohibitively expensive to train even on a small amount of your own data. The standard model-training protocol can also lead to catastrophic forgetting. In this week's episode, Jon explores a solution to these problems, introducing listeners to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and the leading approach: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).Additional materials: www.superdatascience.com/674Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?

      <title>668: GPT-4: Apocalyptic stepping stone?</title>
      <description>AI risks, RLHF, and inner alignment: GPT stands to give the business world a major boost. But with everyone racing either to develop products that incorporate GPT or use it to carry out critical tasks, what dangers could lie ahead in working with a tool that applies essentially unknowable means (inner alignments) to reach its goals? This week’s guest Jérémie Harris speaks with Jon Krohn about the essential need for anyone working with GPT to understand the impact of a system comprising inner alignments that cannot – and may never – be fully understood.Additional materials: www.superdatascience.com/668Interested in sponsoring a SuperDataScience Podcast episode?

      <title>297: Fortitude &amp; Passion in the Data Science Journey</title>
      <description>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with data scientist Ayodele Odubela. You will hear how and why she chose to do a Masters in Data Science and supplemented that with online education. You will also hear about self-discovery, fortitude and passion, and how she got one of her data science jobs through Twitter. You will learn about some of Ayodele's projects like using SVM for detecting poisonous vs. edible mushrooms, using random forests and decision trees for ranking wines based on the chemical contents, using the Naive Bayes to detect spam. You will learn about the real-world project that she's worked on, bullet stopping flying drones. You will find out what role machine learning played in that project and how they're going to be applied in society once they get rolled out.

      <title>279: Embedding Data Science in Business</title>
      <description>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Head of Data Science at Scribd, Kevin Perko. You will learn what it's like to be a data science manager, or a data science leader, and what it's like to manage a team, and more so two teams, in two different locations, and how that is different to actually doing the technical work. Also, you'll learn about the Book Genome Project at Scribd, what it's like when a company sees data science as a product, as opposed to an auxiliary function, and a very valuable concept of decentralized, or embedded teams, versus core data science teams and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

      <title>277: The New Age of Reason</title>
      <description>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Serial Entrepreneur, Khai Pham. You will learn why data science is an advantage in terms of mindset even to be an entrepreneur. You will hear about general artificial intelligence versus superintelligence, what are the differences and why you don't really need general artificial intelligence to get to superintelligence. You'll also learn how questions are more important than answers, and hence the reasoning engine versus a search engine. You'll hear about Khai's experience in becoming a founder of companies. You'll learn what the whole idea of reasoning is and why companies need to move from data-driven and machine learning-driven to reasoning-driven.

      <title>271: Making the Public Graphically Literate</title>
      <description>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with the legend of visual journalism, Alberto Cairo, who talks about understanding if your data is measuring the right thing that you want to be measuring. You will hear about Simpson's paradox and the ecological fallacy. You will learn about the four kinds of literacy, exploratory data analysis versus communicating results, and how to create a narrative structure in your visualization and convey the insights in a certain way so that people can better understand them. And finally, you will hear about ethics in data visualization.

      <title>263: Communicating Data</title>
      <description>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Eoin Murray, the founder of Kyso.io, a platform where you can blog about your data science projects using tools such as Jupyter notebooks. You will learn what the platform means for data scientists and how you can use it to build your online presence and online portfolio. You will hear about startups and how you can jump into creating a startup, what accelerators are, what angel investors are, and what venture capital funds are. Yu will also hear where data science is going and whether or not data science should be a certified profession.

      <title>259: Building Machine Autonomy With Neural Networks</title>
      <description>In this episode of the SuperDataScience Podcast, I chat with Stephen Welch, a computer vision and neural networks expert who will share a ton of information about the space of self-driving cars. You will learn about self-driving cars starting from the history of neural networks and how that was associated with self-driving cars from the '60s, '70s, '80s and all the way until now. You'll also learn about autonomous driving and the three components in the neural networks related to autonomous driving and what they are and how they work. You will find out about the five different levels of autonomous driving and what to expect in the next 10-20 years. You will hear a case study of how machine learning can be applied to historically older industries and you will also hear some very valuable career advice.
