			<title><![CDATA[What is Neuroprosthetics? with Dr. David Moses ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In this episode, Dr. David Moses discusses his research in speech neuroprosthetics. He delves into his research paper on Neuroprosthesis for Decoding Speech in a Paralyzed Person with Anarthria, highlighting the challenges faced during the study and the deep learning models utilized. Dr. Moses also discusses the potential for further improvements with additional data and whether similar studies have been conducted without the use of implants. The conversation then shifts to the ethics of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), with Dr. Moses sharing his thoughts on concerns surrounding BCIs, ways to encourage more individuals to participate in ethics conversations, and a potential timeline for BCIs entering the market. Finally, Dr. Moses discusses industry opportunities outside of academia and offers advice on how to get started in the field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>About Dr. David Moses </strong>
 Dr. David Moses received a BS in Bioengineering from Rice University and then a PhD in Bioengineering from a joint program between UCSF and UC Berkeley. During his PhD in Dr. Edward Chang&#39;s lab at UCSF, he studied how perceived and produced speech is encoded in the human cortex using electrocorticography (an invasive brain-recording methodology involving electrical sensors placed directly on the brain surface), and he developed a system to decode both kinds of speech from the cortical activity of volunteer participants. After graduating, he remained in Dr. Chang&#39;s lab as a postdoctoral scholar to manage and coordinate projects on a new early-feasibility clinical trial at UCSF to evaluate the potential of electrocorticography and machine learning to restore speech to patients with severe paralysis. After successful proof-of-concept demonstrations, he continues to work towards the development of a clinical implementation to enhance the communicative capabilities of those who are unable to speak.

			<title><![CDATA[Leveraging Data To Make Informed Decisions]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>We dive into the topic of informed decision-making. Our guest today is Ishita Majumdar from eBay, who will be sharing her insights on the top three areas that lead to informed decision-making.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to Ishita , the top three areas that lead to informed decision-making are experimentation, customer 360, and internal business analysis. Experimentation involves testing hypotheses and gathering data to inform decisions. Customer 360 involves a complete understanding of the customer, including their needs, preferences, and behaviors. Internal business analysis involves analyzing internal data to identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She then provides an example of how she does experimentation at eBay. Moving on to optimizing the customer 360 experience, Ishita suggests that it is important to collect as much data as possible about the customer, including demographic information, purchase history, and feedback. She suggests using this data to create personalized experiences for customers and to anticipate their needs. Finally, Ishita discusses how to effectively influence the business to make data-driven decisions internally. </p>
<p><br></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Responsible AI with Christelle Mombo-Zigah]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Today we have the pleasure of speaking with Christelle Mombo Zigah, Responsibility AI Committee Member and Sr Global Customer Success Manager for Cisco. With 15 years, she worked in multiple industries and wore multiple hats before discovering her superpower in helping global technology companies in their growth, transformation, and innovation strategies.</p>
<p>Christelle believes it is “an imperative to make AI accessible to everyone and to implement policies and regulations in the public and private spaces to prevent the effects of discriminating historical data and harmful algorithms at scale”.</p>
<p>In today’s episode Christelle shares her story of how she found her voice as an immigrant woman of color in the tech industry and how we all have a role to play in creating responsible AI. Christelle is a power house and is paving the way for more voices to be heard in AI and is truly an inspiration to all of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>About Christelle Mombo-Zigah</strong></p>
<p>Christelle Mombo-Zigah was born and raised in France, to Congolese parents. She currently lives in Silicon Valley. She is a wife and a mother of two intelligent, funny, and opinionated magical little black girls aged 5.5 and 3. She has a master’s degree in International Economics from La Sorbonne University and recently graduated from Stanford GSB with an executive MBA, where she enjoyed the opportunity to grow her learnings and network with accomplished professionals from all over the world. Christelle Mombo-Zigah is a futurist, an ambidextrous leader, and a problem-solver, who believes in the power of technology to make the world a better place for everyone. As a professional for 15 years, she worked in multiple industries and wore multiple hats before discovering her superpower in helping global technology companies in their growth, transformation, and innovation strategies. Her people- first mindset, commitment to human-centered experiences, and sustainability redirected her focus toward responsible AI and women in technology advocacy. She believes it is “an imperative to make AI accessible to everyone and to implement policies and regulations in the public and private spaces to prevent the pernicious effects of discriminating historical data and harmful algorithms at scale”. Passionate about history and linguistics she speaks French, English, and Spanish fluently and is learning Portuguese. She sees languages as a unifier and a connector to the world. She also appreciates her Kongo heritage and history through its lineage in the Americas and the Caribbean. Christelle recently published her first children’s book and is working on three more before tackling her memoir. She wants to build a legacy for her daughters and share her story to inspire the next generations of leaders and give a voice to the voiceless.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[How Industry & Academia Can Work Together for Maximum Student Outcomes]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>We are talking to Shany Mahalu and Sam Borghese. We discuss how we can design projects that enable success on both the students and the industry standpoint. Finally, we wrap up the episode talking about the future of education, and how technology can enable change.</p>
<p><strong>About Shany Mahalu&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Shany Mahalu Atiya is a higher education professional with an extensive experience designing, implementing, and leading graduate strategic initiatives and educational programs. She serves as the Senior Director, Corporate Engagement and External Relations for the Master of Quantitative Economics (MQE) at UCLA Department of Economics. She is responsible for generating and cultivating a corporate employer pipeline and nurturing meaningful relationships with corporations and industry leaders that position MQE students for success in the job market. Shany began her professional career at the Israeli Defense Forces, where she served as a Non-Commissioned Educational Officer and later as Director of Security Operations for the Israeli Airlines, El Al. After graduating from Pepperdine with a Master of Science in Organization Development in 2008, she further developed her passion for people and leadership, and started her journey as a higher education professional. In her tenure at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School, she led the admissions, recruitment, career development, alumni, and employer relations efforts for the part-time and executive MBA/Master programs. Her passion for diversity and inclusion led her to design and facilitate military-connected career readiness programs and initiatives in collaboration with the Service Academy Career Conference (SACC) and the Amazon Military Event team.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<strong>About Sam Borghese</strong></p>
<p>Sam Borghese has designed and taught eight courses inside the Master of Quantitative Economics (MQE) at UCLA. This curriculum includes, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning in Finance and Blockchain. All course work is project-focussed to allow students to gain pragmatic experience in these fields. Another responsibility at UCLA that Sam has undertaken is advising applied projects. Companies that partner with the MQE layout a data-driven problem in which Sam assembles a team and walks students through potential solutions over an academic quarter. Prior to this, Sam was doing research with a former Economist at George Soros Fund creating models for forecasting asset prices. Both of them teamed up to create a Mock Fund that disseminates the signals for investment banks and other financial institutions to view. This project grew to be the UCLA Quant Lab, which Sam is the appointed Director of. Simultaneously Sam runs a Quant Hedge Fund that is up +30% net of fees in 2022.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Finding Your Executive Voice with Joanna Lovering]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>We have the pleasure of chatting with Joanna Lovering. Joanna is an executive presence coach, workplace psychologist, and fashion stylist who helps primarily women develop transformative leadership skills.</p>
<p>Joanna earned her M.A. in Social-Organizational Psychology from Columbia University before taking on leadership development roles at Tiffany &amp; Co., JetBlue, and Daily Burn, among others.</p>
<p>In this episode, Joanna shares why executive presence is essential for women, how to lead with authenticity, and small practical steps you can take that will lead to big changes. Joanna’s energy is contagious and you will come away inspired after this episode.</p>
<p><strong>About Joanna Lovering</strong></p>
<p>Joanna is an executive presence coach, workplace psychologist, and fashion stylist who helps primarily women develop transformative leadership skills. Using her engaging and approachable method, Joanna teaches women how to show up with character, confidence, and style.</p>
<p>Joanna earned her M.A. in Social-Organizational Psychology from Columbia University before taking on leadership development roles at Tiffany &amp; Co., JetBlue, and Daily Burn, among others. After accumulating over ten years of leadership development experience in a mix of corporate and start-up settings, she founded Copper + Rise in 2017.</p>
<p>Joanna founded Copper + Rise to teach women what no one teaches them about leadership. Over the years, she’s realized that leveling up in your career isn’t just about what you know. We also have to look, speak, and act like leaders--and that’s where executive presence comes in. Joanna defines executive presence as how you speak, how you act, and how you look. It’s the style and substance of who you are. Joanna’s background in psychology, leadership development, and fashion styling is the trifecta she brings to this work.</p>
<p>Joanna’s writing and insights on leadership, presence, and style have been featured in RealSimple, Fast Company, HerMoney, HuffPost, The Muse, Glassdoor, Fairygodboss, TheLadders, and more.</p>

In this episode, Kate shares the inner workings of how music and neuroscience inspired the design of Lately’s AI model, the highs and lows of entrepreneurship, and how authenticity is the only way to lead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Kate Bradley Chernis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Bradley Chernis is the Founder &amp;amp; CEO of Lately – A.I. that learns which words will get you the most engagement and turns video, audio and text into dozens of social posts containing those words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a former rock &apos;n&apos; roll DJ, Kate served 20 million listeners as Music Director and on-air host at Sirius/XM. She’s also an award-winning radio producer, engineer and voice talent with 25 years of national broadcast communications, brand-building, sales and marketing expertise. What she learned in radio about the neuroscience of music helps fuel Lately&apos;s artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to founding Lately, Kate also owned a marketing agency which got Walmart a 130% ROI, YoY for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Kate&apos;s appeared as a guest speaker on hundreds of sales, marketing and entrepreneurial podcasts and has led presentations for Walmart, National Disability Institute, IRS, United Way Worldwide, SaaStr, SXSW, Content Marketing Institute, HubSpot, Harvard University, Columbia University, NYU and others.&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Defying the Labels and Creating Your Own Path with Neha Madhavan]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Listen to Neha Madhavan share her experience working as a business analyst at Formula 1 motorsports.</p>
<p>With a background in IT, she broke the mold to create her own path by moving to Paris to get a degree in project management, and then moved to London and entered a male-dominated industry in motorsport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today she continues to lead the way by breaking the labels given to her and is on a mission to encourage others to feel empowered enough to break away from labels and create the life they desire.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>About Neha Madhavan</strong></p>
<p>"Hello everyone, I am a Business Analyst working in the fast-paced world of Formula 1, the pinnacle of Motorsport. I am involved in the analysis, testing, and deployment of low-code Microsoft Powerplatform solutions to optimize internal business processes. With a strong background in IT, when the only reasonable, industry-approved option for higher studies was in Data Science or Analytics, I followed my heart and pursued a degree in Project Management for which I had to immigrate to Paris from India. Upon graduation, I once again pivoted to Business Analysis and moved to the UK to work in an industry that I am passionate about – as a fan! Never could I have imagined growing up that I could work in F1 without an Automotive background.</p>
<p>I did the inner work to let go of self-limiting beliefs, trust in my skills, and build on them in a way that led to my eventual independence in two foreign countries and freedom of choice in careers. My hope is to inspire and encourage others to feel empowered enough to break away from labels that limit them. As for my labels, I am a brown immigrant woman with a non-motorsport background working in a male-dominated industry and that is simply a fact about part of my identity, not the whole of it."<strong><br>

			<title><![CDATA[Launching a Career in Deep Learning with Misra Turp - Career Development]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Sadie talks with Misra Turp, the founder of "So you want to be a data scientist?", where she teaches people how to get into data science and deep learning. They discuss topics like real world use cases of deep learning and Misra provides a step-by-step guide in the learning journey for deep learning. Misra does a fantastic job of breaking down the complex things down to a simple, easy to understand format that will help you get started on your deep learning journey.<br>
<br>
About Misra Turp</p>
<p>After graduating from my Bachelor's degree on Computer Science in Turkey, I moved to the Netherlands to attend a master's degree. My master's was a specialization in Big Data Engineering. By that point, I had very little idea on where to go with my career so I let my instincts guide me. Fresh out of college, I started working as a data scientist at IBM. During my time there, I got to work in the finance and energy industry. During my time at IBM, I got a lot of questions from aspiring data scientists about how they can too start their data science career. To answer the questions I received the most often, I started my blog So you want to be a data scientist?. This grew into a full-blown platform with videos, blog posts, a podcast and online courses to serve the data science community. After a brief period working in the healthcare industry, I started focusing on So you want to be a data scientist? full-time. Now I make online courses to help beginners learn data science and deep learning and also create content on YouTube and on my website.</p>
<p>Overview<br>
Interested in Deep Learning? Let an expert like Misra guide you through the journey. She discusses how we are using deep learning in the real world and shows us the vision and research behind it all. Misra also shares how you can get started in deep learning, and why having a solid ground first is essential. Finally, see into the future as Misra discusses the top trends in deep learning for 2022.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For some of us, financial and career success does NOT necessarily equal happiness.</p>
<p>And for Lisa Thee, achieving the level of director at a multinational tech company was proving that true.</p>
<p>Simply put, as a working mother and technology company executive, she was on the fast track to burnout.</p>
<p>But in 2018, Lisa did something most others wouldn't...she changed her career focus from one of "success" to significance.</p>
<p>And she never looked back.</p>
<p>For starters, Lisa founded a safety focused software start-up - one which helped scale a leading Cybersecurity AI company to a $40M valuation.</p>
<p>And now, less than 2 years later, she's leading Launch Consulting's Data for Good practice, helping the world's most innovative healthcare, technology, and gaming companies to accomplish some very ambitious goals such as improving digital safety, anti-toxicity, upskilling programs for diverse populations, and applying AI/machine learning for innovation in healthcare.</p>
<p>But it doesn't stop there.</p>
<p>Because as a successful female tech startup founder...</p>
<p>...Lisa is an actively sought after Board of Directors Member (she is a member for 3 Strands Global Foundation and the Sacramento Entrepreneurship Academy)...</p>
<p>...Keynote Speaker, and Consultant…</p>
<p>...and she was named to the Top 100 Human Trafficking and Slavery Disruptors List, and has a TEDx talk coming in 2021 on the topic of "Using AI to disrupt Human Trafficking in the Digital Age".</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, Lisa currently serves as an advisory board member for Engineered Medical Solutions, Spectrum Labs, Marketplace Risk, and Humaxa.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>About Saleem:</strong><br>
<br>
Saleem brings more than thirty years of global business and technology experience to our clients in the West. Since joining Accenture in 1990, he has worked in more than two dozen countries, with some of the world’s leading brands, across a number of industries. In these roles, he envisioned, designed and executed transformational programs focused on growth strategy, operational efficiency and effectiveness, new product or service launches and emerging technology deployment. As the senior managing director and global head of Growth &amp; Strategy for Accenture’s Communications, Media &amp; Technology (CMT) group, he created and executed Accenture’s strategy for a global portfolio of clients. &nbsp;This included acquiring new businesses and investing in the development of unique solutions that addressed the complex and changing needs of our CMT clients. He also led Accenture’s business with CMT clients in the western United States and Canada, building significant relationships with key communication, high-tech and software &amp; platform clients and establishing one of the largest and fastest growing businesses at Accenture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building a workplace that promotes equality, diversity and inclusiveness is a top priority for Saleem. He believes that the diversity of our people drives innovation and value for our clients and increases the positive impact we create in the communities where we live and work. He is passionate about attracting and retaining top talent and helps to create opportunities for diverse individuals who come from nontraditional career paths and academic backgrounds. Building next generation skills and talent is also an important area of focus, and Saleem is working with his leadership team to establish programs that enable future leaders with the right foundational skills for long-term career development and success. He drives community impact through his role on the Bay Area Council Executive Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client executives look to Saleem for advice on everything from business and digital transformation to operational efficiency and effectiveness through process automation and outsourcing. He is currently working with researchers and other business leaders to define the future of work and the skill requirements of a post-pandemic world. &nbsp;Saleem is helping clients understand the impact of industry convergence and how they need to transform their businesses to win against an entirely new breed of competitor. &nbsp;He is also working with clients to maximize their returns from investments in cloud, data and security initiatives and to leverage the platforms and capabilities of innovative new startup partners in Silicon Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saleem holds a degree in Business Administration and Computer Science and an MBA, all from the Schulich School of Business in Toronto. He lives in the Bay Area with his wife and three children. Outside of work, Saleem enjoys cricket, skiing and making the most of the beautiful California outdoors.&nbsp;</p>
