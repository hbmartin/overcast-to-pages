      <title>The AI Implementation Audit: What Section‚Äôs CEO Learned¬†in¬†18¬†Months</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Greg Shove, CEO of Section and founder of Machine and Partners, joins us for a "where are they now" follow-up‚Äîand doesn‚Äôt hold back. Greg walks through the rise of Pro AI, his new AI-powered coach, and why traditional upskilling is already obsolete.</p><p>We explore the overlooked friction points in AI adoption, from cultural taboos (‚Äúit feels like cheating‚Äù) to failed enterprise rollouts. Greg challenges the prevailing mental models and warns that the real upheaval is still ahead: business model disruption, not product disruption.</p><p>From royalty-based agents to outcome-based pricing, Greg lays out why service-heavy industries‚Äîfrom law firms to SaaS‚Äîare heading for a margin-crushing future. Plus: the moral responsibility of CEOs, the fallacy of lifelong learners, and why working with AI means holding onto your own judgment.</p><p>A sharp, honest look at what it really means to work smarter‚Äînot just faster‚Äîin the age of AI.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>AI use is no longer optional‚Äîit's the new baseline.</strong><br />Proficiency with AI tools isn‚Äôt a competitive edge anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs a basic requirement. Greg argues that ‚Äúbeing in the AI class‚Äù is now table stakes, and organizations must rapidly close the gap between aspiration and actual adoption.</li><li><strong>Business model disruption will hit harder than tech disruption.</strong><br />Greg makes a compelling case that AI‚Äôs biggest impact won‚Äôt come from the tools themselves, but from entirely new ways of charging for value‚Äîlike outcome-based pricing and AI-native service models that undercut human capital costs.</li><li><strong>Leaders must shift from AI policies to AI manifestos.</strong><br />Adoption is stalling because organizations lead with fear. Instead, Greg urges leaders to clearly message that using AI is smart, encouraged, and expected‚Äîand to model that behavior themselves.</li><li><strong>Most people won't be lifelong learners‚Äîso give them outputs, not courses.</strong><br />With Pro AI, Greg confronts a hard truth: most users don‚Äôt want to learn; they want results.

      <title>Rebuilding from Inside: How John Waldmann Led an AI Shift Without Breaking His Team</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, John Waldmann, CEO of Homebase, shares how the 10-year-old SaaS company blew up its roadmap and rebuilt around AI‚Äîfrom culture to code. He walks us through the shift from 20-page PRDs to lightning-fast demos, reclaiming product leadership, and pushing teams into their ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment with AI.</p><p>We explore the leadership reckoning, cultural resistance, and practical playbook behind the transformation‚Äîand what it means for the future of SaaS, small businesses, and human-centered AI. If you're leading (or bracing for) an AI shift, this one‚Äôs packed with hard-earned lessons and honest insight.<br /><br /><strong>Key Takeaways:¬†</strong></p><ul><li><strong>You Can‚Äôt Wait for Buy-In‚ÄîLeadership Means Pushing the Shift </strong>‚Äî John didn‚Äôt wait for excitement or alignment‚Äîhe took back product leadership and <i>forced</i> the move toward AI.

From engineers to support teams, John had to help people reach their ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment with AI. That‚Äôs when change sticks. Until then, it‚Äôs just optional homework. Leaders need to make adoption <i>inevitable</i>.</li><li><strong>AI Should Bring You Closer to Your Customers, Not Farther </strong>‚Äî This episode isn‚Äôt about chasing shiny tools. It‚Äôs about using AI to reduce the noise‚Äîso your team can focus more on humans, not less.

      <title>What AI Can&apos;t Replace ‚Äì How The Atlantic Deals with Disruption</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, shares a personal and expansive look at how AI is reshaping creativity, leadership, and human connection. From using ChatGPT in marathon training to rethinking journalism in the age of agents, Nicholas explores AI not just as a tool‚Äîbut as a thought partner.</p><p>We dive into cognitive offloading vs. augmentation, the ethics of AI-generated content, and why preserving ‚Äúunwired‚Äù intelligence still matters. He also reflects on leading through disruption, building analog habits, and fostering team-wide experimentation. A rich conversation on staying human in an increasingly automated world.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Your ‚Äúunwired‚Äù intelligence is your AI superpower</strong> ‚Äî The more human skills you build‚Äîlike deep focus, emotional presence, and analog thinking‚Äîthe better you‚Äôll be at wielding AI. Thompson argues that cultivating these unwired abilities isn‚Äôt just about staying grounded‚Äîit‚Äôs about unlocking the full potential of the tools.</li><li><strong>Don‚Äôt fight the storm‚Äîgear up and adapt</strong> ‚Äî AI is already transforming media and creative industries. Thompson compares it to a coming storm: you can‚Äôt stop it by yelling at the clouds. Instead, embrace it, understand it deeply, and make strategic decisions based on where it‚Äôs heading.</li><li><strong>Leadership means showing, not just telling</strong> ‚Äî As a CEO navigating disruption, Thompson doesn‚Äôt just advocate for AI exploration‚Äîhe models it. From training staff on GPTs to walking the halls and testing ideas live, he treats leadership as a practice of visible experimentation and continuous learning.</li><li><strong>AI relationships can‚Äôt replace real connection‚Äîbut they can confuse it</strong> ‚Äî Whether it's logging meals with a bot or losing a personalized Enneagram coach to a reset, Thompson highlights the emotional pull of AI and the dangers of relying on digital companions over human ones. Staying socially connected, especially through ‚Äúthird spaces,‚Äù is more important than ever.</li></ul><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasxthompson/">Nicholas Thompson | LinkedIn</a><br />The Atlantic: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/">World Edition - The Atlantic</a><br />Website: <a href="https://www.nickthompson.com/">Home - Nicholas Thompson</a><br />X: <a href="https://x.com/nxthompson">nxthompson (@nxthompson)</a><br />Strava: <a href="https://www.strava.com/sports/cycling?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=&utm_term=strava&utm_content=Brand_Universal&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2ZfABhDBARIsAHFTxGzdcuVIgXC7-2efycJQzWNpanxcayb4OFgcEPrqzIRHh8kRcVi-T8EaAsMFEALw_wcB">Cycling & Biking App - Tracker, Trails, Training & More | Strava</a><br />Caitlin Flanagan ‚Äì <i>Sex Without Women:</i> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/sex-without-women/682064/?utm%5C_source=copy-link&utm%5C_medium=social&utm%5C_campaign=share">Article:SexWithoutWomen-TheAtlantic</a></p><p><strong>00:00</strong> Introduction to Nicholas Thompson<br /><strong>00:11</strong> Navigating the Information Overload<br /><strong>01:10</strong> Daily Tech Insights and Tools<br /><strong>02:10</strong> Using AI for Content Creation<br /><strong>04:39</strong> AI as a Personal Trainer<br /><strong>08:02</strong> Emotional Connections with AI<br /><strong>12:12</strong> The Risks of AI Relationships<br /><strong>16:17</strong> Preparing for AGI and Cognitive Offloading<br /><strong>30:26</strong> AI's Impact on Leadership<br /><strong>31:10</strong> Navigating AI Competitors<br /><strong>32:01</strong> Internal AI Strategies<br /><strong>32:49</strong> Ethical Considerations in AI Usage<br /><strong>34:07</strong> AI in Journalism and Writing<br /><strong>36:32</strong> Practical AI Applications<br /><strong>40:27</strong> Balancing AI and Human Skills<br /><strong>49:27</strong> Future of AI in Media<br /><strong>53:50</strong> Final Thoughts and Reflections</p><p>üìú Read the transcript for this episode: <a href="https://podcast.beyondtheprompt.ai/episodes/unwired-intelligence-ceo-of-the-atlantic-nicholas-thompson-on-what-ai-cant-replace/transcript">Transcript of What AI Can't Replace ‚Äì How The Atlantic Deals with Disruption |</a></p>

      <title>Prompting for Originality: How Devin McNulty Is AI-Enabling His Workshop Business</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Devin McNulty, founder of Funmentum Labs and creator of Funware, shares how he‚Äôs turning fun into a serious engine for creative work. After 15 years of running workshops for Fortune 500s, Devin built an AI-powered facilitation tool that helps hybrid teams generate better ideas‚Äîwithout needing a pro in the room.</p><p>We explore how he treats AI like a co-facilitator, not a thought partner, and what it means to ‚Äúpre-train‚Äù AI the way you'd brief a human. Devin also unpacks how to turn creative intuition into scalable software‚Äîand why levity, timing, and rough ideas can unlock big breakthroughs. A smart listen for anyone building tools, workshops, or teams that need to think more boldly.<br /><br /><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fun Is a Strategic Tool‚ÄîNot a Distraction </strong>‚Äì Devin challenges the assumption that ‚Äúfun‚Äù and ‚Äúserious work‚Äù are at odds. His facilitation method uses play to unlock alignment, compress timelines, and spark better ideas‚Äîespecially in rooms that normally resist creative approaches.</li><li><strong>AI Can Facilitate, Not Just Assist </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>Most teams use AI as a solo tool or sidekick. Devin flips the script‚Äîdesigning AI to act like a group facilitator. <i>Funware</i> injects prompts, rephrases challenges, and even drops well-timed bad ideas to shift group dynamics and drive progress.</li><li><strong>Pre-training Your AI Is Like Prepping a Human Teammate</strong> ‚Äì<strong> </strong>One of Devin‚Äôs biggest insights: treat your AI agents like collaborators. Build them with clear intent, layer in prompting strategy, and fine-tune them for the moment they‚Äôll be used‚Äîjust like you‚Äôd brief a co-facilitator before a workshop.</li><li><strong>Productizing Yourself Is the New Playbook </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>Devin‚Äôs journey is a case study in AI-first entrepreneurship‚Äîturning deep craft into software. His advice? Start with your workflow, atomize it into repeatable components, and build tools that deliver value with the push of a button.</li></ul><p>Website: <a href="https://funmentum.com/">Funmentum‚Ñ¢ Labs</a><br />LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/demcnulty/">Devin McNulty | LinkedIn</a></p><p><strong>00:00</strong> Intro to Funmentum Labs & Funware<br /><strong>00:38</strong> Why Fun Is a Powerful Work Strategy<br /><strong>01:41</strong> Overcoming Skepticism in Serious Workplaces<br /><strong>02:27</strong> Techniques to Engage Resistant Teams<br /><strong>06:32</strong> Can AI Be Funny?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Devin McNulty, founder of Funmentum Labs and creator of Funware, shares how he‚Äôs turning fun into a serious engine for creative work. After 15 years of running workshops for Fortune 500s, Devin built an AI-powered facilitation tool that helps hybrid teams generate better ideas‚Äîwithout needing a pro in the room.</p><p>We explore how he treats AI like a co-facilitator, not a thought partner, and what it means to ‚Äúpre-train‚Äù AI the way you'd brief a human. Devin also unpacks how to turn creative intuition into scalable software‚Äîand why levity, timing, and rough ideas can unlock big breakthroughs. A smart listen for anyone building tools, workshops, or teams that need to think more boldly.<br /><br /><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fun Is a Strategic Tool‚ÄîNot a Distraction </strong>‚Äì Devin challenges the assumption that ‚Äúfun‚Äù and ‚Äúserious work‚Äù are at odds. His facilitation method uses play to unlock alignment, compress timelines, and spark better ideas‚Äîespecially in rooms that normally resist creative approaches.</li><li><strong>AI Can Facilitate, Not Just Assist </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>Most teams use AI as a solo tool or sidekick. Devin flips the script‚Äîdesigning AI to act like a group facilitator. <i>Funware</i> injects prompts, rephrases challenges, and even drops well-timed bad ideas to shift group dynamics and drive progress.</li><li><strong>Pre-training Your AI Is Like Prepping a Human Teammate</strong> ‚Äì<strong> </strong>One of Devin‚Äôs biggest insights: treat your AI agents like collaborators. Build them with clear intent, layer in prompting strategy, and fine-tune them for the moment they‚Äôll be used‚Äîjust like you‚Äôd brief a co-facilitator before a workshop.</li><li><strong>Productizing Yourself Is the New Playbook </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>Devin‚Äôs journey is a case study in AI-first entrepreneurship‚Äîturning deep craft into software. His advice? Start with your workflow, atomize it into repeatable components, and build tools that deliver value with the push of a button.</li></ul><p>Website: <a href="https://funmentum.com/">Funmentum‚Ñ¢ Labs</a><br />LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/demcnulty/">Devin McNulty | LinkedIn</a></p><p><strong>00:00</strong> Intro to Funmentum Labs & Funware<br /><strong>00:38</strong> Why Fun Is a Powerful Work Strategy<br /><strong>01:41</strong> Overcoming Skepticism in Serious Workplaces<br /><strong>02:27</strong> Techniques to Engage Resistant Teams<br /><strong>06:32</strong> Can AI Be Funny?

      <title>How Mihir Shukla Is Reimagining Work With 300 Million AI Agents (and Counting)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Mihir Shukla, CEO and Chairman of Automation Anywhere, shares how he‚Äôs building an autonomous enterprise‚Äîwhere AI doesn‚Äôt just assist work, but performs it. With over 300 million AI agents in action, Mihir argues the future of work is already here.</p><p>We dive into how Automation Anywhere automates everything from tax to customer service, how to spot high-impact use cases, and why culture‚Äînot tech‚Äîis the biggest blocker. Mihir also zooms out to explore the global productivity crisis, the shrinking workforce, and the moral imperative to upskill at scale. A powerful episode on what work can look like when AI is truly embedded.</p><p><br /><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don‚Äôt Wait for the Future of Work‚ÄîBuild It - </strong>Mihir‚Äôs team is already running 300 million AI agents across global enterprises. From automating 90% of tax operations to generating CEO-ready briefings on the fly, he shows how much of today‚Äôs work <i>can</i> be autonomous‚Äîand how fast it‚Äôs scaling.</li><li><strong>Stalled Productivity? AI Is the Only Way Through - </strong>Despite $40 trillion in global IT spend, productivity hasn‚Äôt improved since 2008‚Äîand now the workforce is shrinking. Mihir argues that doubling productivity isn‚Äôt a moonshot‚Äîit‚Äôs an economic necessity, and AI is our best shot.</li><li><strong>Change Doesn‚Äôt Come from the Top‚ÄîIt Starts with Teams - </strong>Transformation doesn‚Äôt begin in the boardroom. Mihir shares how just 2 out of 10 employees experimenting with AI can ignite org-wide momentum‚Äîif they‚Äôre given ambitious goals, proper training, and permission to lead.</li><li><strong>Upskill the World, One Community at a Time - </strong>From the Mississippi Delta to Nepal, Mihir‚Äôs upskilling efforts prove that AI fluency doesn‚Äôt require a degree‚Äîjust access.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Eric Porres, Global Head of AI at Logitech, shares how he‚Äôs working to turn a 7,000-person company into an AI-fluent organization.

      <title>Future-Proofing Your Career and Income in the Age of AI with Dr. Joan Palmiter Bajorek</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>AI is transforming careers, personal branding, and financial planning - so how can you stay ahead? Dr. Joan Palmiter Bajorek, entrepreneur, investor, bestselling author, and host of Your AI Roadmap, shares strategies from her new book to help future-proof your career and income.<br />She breaks down how to build a strong personal brand, expand your network, and stay financially secure in an AI-driven world. We also explore AI‚Äôs impact on job searches, gender bias, and the balance between automation and authenticity.<br />Whether you want to pivot into AI, strengthen your career, or make smarter financial moves, this episode offers valuable, actionable strategies to help you navigate the future.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Optimize for AI Search</strong> ‚Äì Treat your online presence like SEO for AI. Ensure your LinkedIn and personal website include the right keywords so AI-driven tools and recruiters can easily find you.</li><li><strong>Networking Drives Career Growth</strong> ‚Äì 70% of jobs come from introductions.
