      <title>How AI is Powering Defense, ISR, and the Military Tech Stack with Modern Intelligence's CEO, John Dulin</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/autopilot</link>
      <description>In this episode of Autopilot with Will Summerlin, Modern Intelligence CEO John Dulin discusses the vital role of AI for the future of U.S. military defense and intelligence. He dives into challenges like integrating AI with legacy systems, his contrarian vision for building the foundational AI platform for national security, initiatives like JADC2 and scaling human ISR analysts with AI. John also shares his journey from physics to machine learning at GRAIL before starting Modern, compares U.S. and Chinese AI progress, selling software to the DoD, and his priorities if he was President for leading in military AI. A must-watch for anyone interested in AI's impact on national security.
