			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we spoke to Kirsten Hill.</p><p>Dr Kirsten Hill is a researcher, writer, and the founder of bisque — a survey platform that actually cares if you get good data. She has a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, has led research for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and has worked with over 100 mission-driven teams on measurement &amp; evaluation. This past year, she authored her first book, Ask Better Questions, a top release on survey design — and realized that writing the book wasn’t enough. If she really wanted to change how people do research, she had to build the tools that would make it easier to do it right. With real-time AI feedback, intuitive design, and built-in best practices, bisque makes it easy to create surveys that get you the answers you actually need.</p><p>We spoke to Kirsten about how and why surveys are often bad, why she believes the major survey platforms aren&#39;t fit for purpose, why she&#39;s building her own survey platform &quot;bisque&quot;, how she&#39;s using Large Language Models to develop a working prototype, and what advice she has for other non-programmers who want to build things with AI.</p><p>You can find her on:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstenleehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenleehill</a></li><li>TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirstenleehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kirstenleehill</a></li><li>Substack <a href="https://kirstenleehill.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kirstenleehill.substack.com</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p>---</p><p>David’s book, The Well-Grounded Data Analyst is out! <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst">⁠https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst⁠</a></p><p>If you want to find out more, we have a whole episode about it: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5D0iDtQRh3tWiIhokrjz3x?si=AiX6YyRET16lnzXDlvdcfw">⁠https://open.spotify.com/episode/5D0iDtQRh3tWiIhokrjz3x?si=AiX6YyRET16lnzXDlvdcfw</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re an aspiring analyst and want to test your existing data skills on real-world problems while learning both new skills and a framework you can apply to any problem, David&#39;s book Solve Any Data Analysis Problem is available on the Manning website through the Early Access Program and it&#39;s out in print later this year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Find it at <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/solve-any-data-analysis-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.manning.com/books/solve-any-data-analysis-problem</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In this episode, we welcome back a former guest, Andrea Jones-Rooy, Ph.D.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Andrea is the founder of Data Thinking, an organization dedicated to promoting worldwide data literacy and public involvement in data science. Previously, she was the Director of Undergraduate Studies and Visiting Associate Professor at the NYU Center for Data Science, where she developed and taught their flagship course, Data Science for Everyone, as well as advanced courses on Natural Language Processing. Dr. Jones-Rooy believes everyone has a role to play in data science, and you (yes, you!) can get involved at <a href="https://datascienceneedsyou.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">DataScienceNeedsYou.com</a>!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We spoke to Andrea about how to teach people the scientific method and to deal with uncertainty, the impact of generative AI on teaching these topics, whether these skills should be called &quot;data thinking&quot; instead of &quot;data science&quot;, and how you even convince people these are the skills worth learning.</p>
<p><br></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A reminder that David&#39;s book, Solve Any Data Analysis Problem, is out later this year and you can already buy it and read it in its draft form as part of Manning&#39;s Early Access Program. If you want to practise your data skills on real world problems and learn a reusable framework to use on any project in the future, this book is for you.</p>
<p>Find out more here: <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/solve-any-data-analysis-problem">⁠https://www.manning.com/books/solve-any-data-analysis-problem⁠</a></p>
<p>Now onto today&#39;s episode.</p>
<p>In this episode, we spoke to Richard McElreath.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Richard is an anthropologist focused on the role of culture in human evolution and adaptation. He is currently the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. A major focus of the department is integrating theory with data analysis and study design, and Richard spends much of his time supporting his colleagues in that way. He is the author of Statistical Rethinking, a popular Bayesian statistics textbook and video course.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We spoke to Richard about the state of scientific research, parallels between the problems in scientific research and doing data analysis in the business world, and to quote Richard, how, if we are very careful and try very hard, we might not completely mislead ourselves.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>First of all, David&#39;s book Solve Any Data Analysis Problem is available in Manning&#39;s Early Access Program!</p>
<p>You can read more about it here: <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/solve-any-data-analysis-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.manning.com/books/solve-any-data-analysis-problem</a> (if it&#39;s not on offer when you&#39;re there, you can get 35% off with the code <strong>au35asb</strong>).</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>In this episode, we talked to James Cotton, co-founder of iO-Sphere.</p>
<p>Canadian originally, James has been working in the UK for the last 10 years, always in analytics, pricing, and data science. After a short stint in insurance he was at hotels.com for 3.5 years always working in customer analytics and marketing analytics. He then went to worldremit – a large uk fintech company that’s sort of like a digital western union. There he built out a team, growing it significantly. Over the past 7 or 8 years he’s hired dozens and dozens of data professionals of all levels – clearly seeing the gap between existing data training programmes and courses and the real need in industry.</p>
<p>James is one of the founders of iO-Sphere, which was created in order to close that gap with actually useful, practical, training. They also fund all the training of everyone that comes onto the programme – helping to lower financial barriers to accessing high quality training and these careers.</p>
<p>We talked to James about the skill gap between training and the real world, why no one has thought to close that gap in the way io-Sphere have, whether standardisation makes sense for the analytics industry, and of course where AI fits into all this.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[S03E04 - The language of data literacy - with Valerie Logan]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Continuing our series of conversations with data educators, in this episode we spoke to Valerie Logan.</p>
<p>Founding The Data Lodge in 2019, Valerie is as committed to data literacy as it gets.  She believes that in today&#39;s digital society, data literacy is not just a work skill- it&#39;s a life skill.  With advisory services, train-the-trainer bootcamps, an extensive resource library and community services at The Data Lodge, Valerie is certifying the world’s first Data Literacy Program Leads across commercial, nonprofit and public sectors.</p>
<p>In 2022, The Data Lodge was recognized by CDO Magazine as one of the &quot;Top 25 Data Startups to Watch in 2022&quot;.  Valerie has more than 28 years of experience, including two decades of global consulting across industries, and five years of applied experience in the telecommunications industry at both field and enterprise levels. She holds a B.S. in Math from SUNY College at Buffalo and an M.S. in Applied Math with a concentration in Operations Research from New Mexico State.</p>
<p>We talked to Valerie about how literacy in data is like literacy in any language, how to spread data literacy effectively in a business, what are some obstacles to doing this, how you measure the success of a data literacy program, and of course the effect of the emergence of AI on all of the above. Valerie even made a custom Scrabble board just for this episode, you can see that on our website <a href="http://halfstackdatascience.com">halfstackdatascience.com</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Half Stack Data Science we continue our season 3 all about data science education, with a conversation with Matt Harrison.</p>
<p>Matt stands as a prominent figure in the Python and data science community. A Stanford Computer Science alumnus, he&#39;s made significant contributions through his best-selling books, which include titles like &quot;Effective Pandas&quot;, &quot;Effective XGBoost&quot;, &quot;Machine Learning Pocket Reference&quot;, and &quot;Illustrated Guide to Learning Python 3.&quot; Beyond authorship, Matt has shared his expertise at major corporations such as Netflix and NASA, as well as academic institutions like Stanford, the University of Utah, and BYU. With a Python journey beginning in 2000, he&#39;s equipped thousands with vital skills, both online and in-person. He runs MetaSnake, a Python and Data training company.</p>
<p>We talked to Matt about the pushback he gets whenever he posts code online, what we all think of Excel’s newly announced Python integration, how ChatGPT has affected our work, and whether cooking is a good metaphor for programming.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Half Stack Data Science we continue our season 3, all about data science education, with a conversation with Reuven Lerner.</p>
<p>Reuven is a full-time Python trainer with a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science and engineering from MIT, and a PhD in learning sciences from Northwestern University. </p>
<p>In 2020, Reuven published &quot;Python Workout&quot; a collection of Python exercises with extensive explanations, published by Manning. He&#39;s currently working on &quot;Pandas workout&quot; a similar collection of exercises using the &quot;pandas&quot; library for data analytics.</p>
<p>Reuven&#39;s free, weekly &quot;Better developers&quot; newsletter, about Python and software engineering, is read by more than 30,000 developers around the globe.</p>
<p>Reuven&#39;s most recent venture is Bamboo Weekly: Every Wednesday, he presents a problem based on current events, using a public data set. And every Thursday, he shared detailed solutions to those problems using Pandas.</p>
<p>We spoke to Reuven about his love of teaching Python to beginners, what he thinks of notebooks and ChatGPT as educational tools, and how he got banned for life from advertising on Facebook.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we bring you our talk from the recent <a href="https://live.datasciencefestival.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Data Science Festival</a> in London. Our talk was titled "Bridging the data science supply-demand gap" and it was all about topics that will be familiar to listeners. We tackled the question "how is it that there is an abundance of junior data scientists and open data science positions yet the job market is unsatisfactory for both sides"? A huge thank you to Data Science Festival for having us, and for allowing us to share the audio with our audience!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[S2E4 - Chris Moffitt]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Half Stack Data Science we continue our series "The Orthogonals" with a conversation with Chris Moffitt.</p>
<p>Chris is a Senior Manager Strategic Pricing &amp; Analytics in the medical device industry. He is an active Python user with over 15 years of experience using Python for everything from web development to system administration and most recently data science. He is the author of the popular blog Practical Business Python (pbpython.com) where he describes how to use Python to solve common business problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spoke to Chris about how he has used Python to his benefit at work, how the desire for automation is a mindset, and the future of complex machine learning models in the business world. Chris is entirely self-taught when it comes to using Python and you'll hear him reflect on this when he says "There's no way to learn programming outside of programming".</p>

			<title><![CDATA[S2E3 - Joana Wang]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of "the orthogonals" we spoke to Joana Wang. Joana is a data aficionado with a passion for education. Her ambition is to help people demystify the world of data and make analytics second nature while having fun.</p>
<p>Having worked both in strategy consulting and industry, she's had projects across retail &amp; wholesale, supply chain and financial services. In her last 8 years of experience, she's spent most of her time doing financial modelling, building bespoke data analytics products and wrangling data - a lot of it! This has required her to not only be able to technically develop solutions but also understand the wider business context and relate to people's needs, which she tries to embed in her teaching style.</p>
<p>We spoke with Joana about a variety of topics including how to incorporate data science into the business world, the state of data science education, what skills you need to be a data scientist and which of those skills are easier to teach or can even be taught at all. To give you a teaser, she summarised this beautifully when she said "No amount of code is going to tell you how to think".</p>

			<title><![CDATA[S2E2 - Peter Ellis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In episode 2 of "The Orthogonals" Shaun and David spoke to Peter Ellis. Peter is a Director and Chief Data Scientist at Nous Group, an international management consultancy operating in 10 locations across the UK, Australia and Canada. He also writes the Free Range Statistics blog, a great place to see cutting-edge techniques applied to real-world problems, all with reproducible code. But you'll never guess what his undergraduate degree was (hint: requires long fingernails on one hand only!)</p>
<p>We spoke about scraping emojis from tweets, why Drew Conway's Venn diagram is still relevant in 2020, and becoming a data scientist to argue with economists.</p>
<p>You can find Peter on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ellis2013nz" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@ellis2013nz</a> or on his <a href="http://freerangestats.info/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Free Range Statistics</a> blog.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[S2E1 - Andrea Jones-Rooy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the first episode of season 2, "The Orthogonals", Shaun and David speak to Andrea Jones-Rooy.</p>
<p>Andrea is a social scientist specializing in complexity. &nbsp;She has written a book and several research papers on complex systems, and regularly contributes articles to media outlets on (you guessed it!) complexity — plus data science, international relations, diversity, and uncertainty. She is also a standup comedian and circus performer. The whole thing is confusing, but basically she’ll do whatever it takes to get people to pay attention to social science &amp; complexity. Andrea earned her Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>We discussed why you shouldn't do a political science PhD to become a data scientist, how a political science PhD will benefit you in data science if you happen to have one, finishing a PhD thesis in a Thai restaurant, and what skills are missing from most data science courses and what to do about it.</p>
