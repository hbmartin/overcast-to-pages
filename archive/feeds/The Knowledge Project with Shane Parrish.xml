      <title>#232 Reed Hastings: The Netflix Playbook for Culture, Judgment, and Scale</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/reed-hastings/</link>
      <description>How do you build a high-performance culture without turning your company into the Hunger Games? Reed Hastings, co-founder and former CEO of Netflix, shares lessons from a career spent rewriting the rules—from severance as a management tool to “big-hearted champions who pick up the trash.” In this episode, he reveals how Netflix scaled trust, made bold bets before the data was in, and kept its edge by treating employees like adults—not assets. You’ll hear how Hastings evaluates talent beyond the interview, the reason he avoids performance improvement plans, and what most leaders misunderstand about judgment, feedback, and innovation. 

You’ll also hear why he placed a $100 million bet on House of Cards with no pilot, how Drive to Survive changed an entire sport, and why Squid Game caught even Netflix by surprise. 

Now focused on a new chapter—owning a ski mountain, reshaping education through AI tutors, and supporting charter schools—Hastings is still doing what he does best: building systems that scale culture, not just product. 

If you care about performance without politics—or culture without the clichés—this is a blueprint from one of the clearest thinkers in modern business.

      <title>#231 Outliers: Harvey Firestone – Men and Rubber</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-harvey-firestone/</link>
      <description>Most people fear a $43 million debt. Harvey Firestone called it “invigorating.” When his company faced collapse in 1920 and his executives panicked, Firestone seized control. He fired the sales manager, slashed prices 25%, and personally ran the sales department. It worked—not because he managed through fear, but through clarity.  

Firestone was the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company—an outsider who built one of America’s iconic industrial empires by doing the opposite of what everyone else did. This episode isn’t about tires. It’s about how Firestone quietly built one of the great businesses of the 20th century by asking two deceptively simple questions: Is it necessary? Can it be simplified? 

This episode breaks down the invisible principles behind Firestone’s success: positioning over talent, inputs over outcomes, discipline over drama. If you lead a team or simply want to lead yourself better, this story is a masterclass in building enduring advantages.  

This episode is for informational purposes only and is based on Men and Rubber: The Story of Business by Harvey Firestone.

      <title> #230 Bill Belichick: 8x Super Bowl Champion on Winning, Leadership, and Discipline</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/bill-belichick/</link>
      <description>Eight Super Bowl rings. Six with the Patriots. And a mindset that goes far deeper than football. In this rare, wide-ranging conversation, Bill Belichick breaks down the invisible factors behind sustained excellence: discipline, preparation, and the mental edge that separates contenders from champions. He shares the surprising reason he kept Tom Brady as a fourth-string rookie, why talent alone is never enough at the highest level, and how true competitors find ways to win long after their gifts fade. 

You’ll hear why Belichick cut a player the week of the Super Bowl, how technology is changing player preparation and locker room culture, and why “we have control of the game” became the rallying belief in the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history. This episode covers everything from how he decides when to push a player—or pull back—to how trust is built inside elite teams. Belichick also explains why the price of success is always paid in advance—and why there’s no shortcut around the work. If you lead a team, or want to lead yourself better, this episode is a masterclass from the greatest football mind of our time.

      <title>#229 Outliers: Andy Grove – Only The Paranoid Survive</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-andy-grove/</link>
      <description>Most people protect their identity. Andy Grove would rewrite his, again and again. He started as a refugee, became a chemist, turned himself into an engineer, then a manager, and finally the CEO who built Intel into a global powerhouse. He didn’t cling to credentials or titles. When a challenge came up, he didn’t delegate, he learned. This episode explores the radical adaptability that made Grove different. While his peers obsessed over innovation, he focused on something far more enduring: the systems, structures, and people needed to scale that innovation. Grove understood that as complexity rises, technical brilliance fades and coordination becomes king. 

You’ll learn how he redefined leadership, why he saw management as a creative act, and what most founders still get wrong about building great companies. If you’re serious about getting better—at work, at thinking, at leading—this is the episode you’ll be glad you didn’t miss. 

This episode is for informational purposes only and most of the research came from The Life and Times of an American by Richard S. Tedlow, Only the Paranoid Survive by Andy Grove, and Tom Wolfe’s profile of Robert Noyce available here.

      <title>#228 Elad Gil: How to Spot a Billion-Dollar Startup Before the Rest of the World</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/elad-gil/</link>
      <description>What if the world’s most connected tech investor handed you his mental playbook? Elad Gil, an investor behind Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase and Anduril, flips conventional wisdom on its head and prioritizes market opportunities over founders. Elad decodes why innovation has clustered geographically throughout history, from Renaissance Florence to Silicon Valley, where today 25% of global tech wealth is created. We get into why he believes AI is dramatically under-hyped and still under-appreciated, why remote work hampers innovation, and the self-inflicted wounds that he's seen kill most startups.  

This is a masterclass in pattern recognition from one of tech's most consistent and accurate forecasters, revealing the counterintuitive principles behind identifying world-changing ideas. 

Disclaimer: This episode was recorded in January. The pace of AI development is staggering, and some of what we discussed has already evolved. But the mental models Elad shares about strategy, judgment, and high-agency thinking are timeless and will remain relevant for years to come.

Disclaimer: This episode was recorded in January. The pace of AI development is staggering, and some of what we discussed has already evolved. But the mental models Elad shares about strategy, judgment, and high-agency thinking are timeless and will remain relevant for years to come.

        <![CDATA[<p>What if the world’s most connected tech investor handed you his mental playbook? Elad Gil, an investor behind Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase and Anduril, flips conventional wisdom on its head and prioritizes market opportunities over founders. Elad decodes why innovation has clustered geographically throughout history, from Renaissance Florence to Silicon Valley, where today 25% of global tech wealth is created. We get into why he believes AI is dramatically under-hyped and still under-appreciated, why remote work hampers innovation, and the self-inflicted wounds that he's seen kill most startups.  </p>

      <title>#227 Outliers: Rose Blumkin — Women of Berkshire Hathaway </title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-rose-blumkin/</link>
      <description>Rose Blumkin didn’t just build a business. She revolutionized retail. After fleeing Russia with $66 in her purse, she opened a basement furniture store in Omaha at 43 years old—with no English, no education, and no connections. Her formula? Sell cheap, tell the truth, don't cheat the customer. Nebraska Furniture Mart would survive depressions, fires, lawsuits, tornadoes—and eventually become a billion-dollar empire Warren Buffett called “the ideal business.” 

Learn how Mrs. B’s relentless focus, radical simplicity, and unbreakable work ethic built an empire from scratch—and what her story teaches us about business, resilience, and the power of earned trust.

This episode is for informational purposes only and most of the research came from "Women of Berkshire Hathaway" and oral history interviews with Rose Blumkin and her daughter Frances.

      <title>#226 Garry Tan: Billion-Dollar Misfits — Inside Y Combinator’s Startup Formula</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/garry-tan/</link>
      <description>Most accelerators fund ideas. Y Combinator funds founders—and transforms them. With a 1% acceptance rate and alumni behind 60% of the past decade’s unicorns, YC knows what separates the founders who break through from those who burn out. It's not the flashiest résumé or the boldest pitch but something President Garry Tan says is far rarer: earnestness. In this conversation, Garry reveals why this is the key to success, and how it can make or break a startup. We also dive into how AI is reshaping the whole landscape of venture capital and what the future might look like when everyone has intelligence on tap. 

If you care about innovation, agency, or the future of work, don’t miss this episode.

      <itunes:summary>Most accelerators fund ideas. Y Combinator funds founders—and transforms them. With a 1% acceptance rate and alumni behind 60% of the past decade’s unicorns, YC knows what separates the founders who break through from those who burn out. It's not the flashiest résumé or the boldest pitch but something President Garry Tan says is far rarer: earnestness. In this conversation, Garry reveals why this is the key to success, and how it can make or break a startup. We also dive into how AI is reshaping the whole landscape of venture capital and what the future might look like when everyone has intelligence on tap. 

If you care about innovation, agency, or the future of work, don’t miss this episode.

      <title>#225 Outliers: Henry Singleton – Distant Force </title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-henry-singleton/</link>
      <description>If Warren Buffett is the king of capital allocation—Henry Singleton is the ghost. Singleton built one of the most successful conglomerates in American history, transforming business while remaining virtually unknown. While Wall Street chased fads, Singleton, who could play chess blindfolded, quietly turned industrial conglomerate Teledyne into a business juggernaut with 20.4% annual returns over nearly three decades—outperforming Buffett, outmaneuvering rivals, and outlasting the hype. Dive into the mind of a man who Charlie Munger said had "the best operating and capital deployment record in American business—bar none." This is a masterclass in disciplined capital allocation and long-term thinking on the most underrated business genius of the 20th century. 



If you're building a business, allocating capital, or simply trying to think more clearly in a noisy world, you cannot afford to miss this one. 



(03:16) Prologue

(05:59) PART 1: THE MAKING OF A MAVERICK

(07:48) After MIT

(10:24) Founding of Teledyne

(14:04) The Future is Semiconductors

(17:18) What to Acquire?

(19:12) Integrating into the Teledyne System

(21:49) Vasco Metals and George Roberts

(23:40) PART 2: MASTER CAPITAL ALLOCATOR

(28:10) Entering Insurance

(29:44) The Great Buyback Revolution

(32:46) Teledyne Operating Systems

(34:56) Thinking Local

(37:41) Building Knowledge

(39:59) PART 3: PEAK PERFORMANCE

(42:51) Planning for Retirement

(44:09) Passing the Torch

(46:45) End of an Era: Singleton Retires

(47:41) Teledyne After Singleton

(48:46) Singleton’s Legacy

(51:05) SHANE’S REFLECTIONS



This episode is for informational purposes only and most of the research came from reading Distant Force: A Memoir of the Teledyne Corporation and the Man Who Created It, with an Introduction to Teledyne Technologies by Dr. George A. Roberts with Robert J McVicker and The Outsiders by William N. Thorndike, Jr.

      <title>#222 Outliers: Cornelius Vanderbilt — The First Tycoon</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-cornelius-vanderbilt/</link>
      <description>Cornelius Vanderbilt was a force in 19th century America, playing a pivotal role in transitioning the U.S. economy from rural mercantilism to industrial corporate capitalism. Vanderbilt didn't just compete—he dominated; and didn’t just dominate one industry—he conquered three: ferries, steamships, and railroads. He understood that power lay in controlling infrastructure and not just operating within it. His cutthroat tactics were both feared and admired but his vision for what the economy could be was undeniable. 

This is the story of how Vanderbilt turned calculated aggression into an art form, how he endured more pain than his competitors, and how he built systems that outlived him. 

Learn the mindset, strategies, and brutal lessons behind his dominance; the game of business hasn’t changed as much as you think.

      <title>#221 Bruce Flatt on Value, Discipline, and Durability </title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/bruce-flatt/</link>
      <description>Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt reveals the investment philosophy behind building one of the world's largest alternative asset managers with over a trillion dollars under management. 

At the core of Brookfield's strategy is a disciplined focus on downside protection that has delivered 19% annualized returns over 30 years. Flatt identifies three major trends driving their investments: digitalization (including AI infrastructure), global energy transition, and reindustrialization as supply chains shift. The conversation explores Brookfield's approach to risk management, their expansion into insurance, and their meritocratic culture. When Shane presses for clarity on Brookfield's complex corporate structure, Flatt provides rare insights into how the organization's design creates both operational flexibility and investment opportunities. 

What separates Brookfield from competitors? Patient capital: the discipline to wait for extraordinary opportunities and the financial strength to act when others can't. 

If you want to understand how the smartest capital allocators think and what it takes to build something enduring, this episode is essential listening.

      <itunes:summary>Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt reveals the investment philosophy behind building one of the world's largest alternative asset managers with over a trillion dollars under management. 

At the core of Brookfield's strategy is a disciplined focus on downside protection that has delivered 19% annualized returns over 30 years. Flatt identifies three major trends driving their investments: digitalization (including AI infrastructure), global energy transition, and reindustrialization as supply chains shift. The conversation explores Brookfield's approach to risk management, their expansion into insurance, and their meritocratic culture. When Shane presses for clarity on Brookfield's complex corporate structure, Flatt provides rare insights into how the organization's design creates both operational flexibility and investment opportunities. 

What separates Brookfield from competitors? Patient capital: the discipline to wait for extraordinary opportunities and the financial strength to act when others can't. 

If you want to understand how the smartest capital allocators think and what it takes to build something enduring, this episode is essential listening.

      <title>#220 Outliers: James Dyson — Against the Odds</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-james-dyson/</link>
      <description>How do you turn 5,127 failures into a multi-billion-dollar empire? James Dyson turned dust into possibility, failure into discovery, and frustration into revolution.  
 
Dyson didn’t just build a better vacuum; he redefined a whole industry. Facing thousands of failed prototypes, crushing financial setbacks, and a dismissive industry that insisted a superior vacuum was impossible, Dyson transformed doubt into fuel that created an empire he still owns and operates today. 

Dyson’s genius stretched far beyond engineering. He was a contrarian thinker whose natural state was to defy the experts. From reinventing hand dryers to fans and hairdryers, Dyson repeatedly turned mundane frustrations into game-changing products. His relentless curiosity and willingness to fail publicly set new standards for innovation. When competitors mocked him, he stayed focused. When patents were threatened, he defended fiercely. Dyson's story is one of unwavering persistence, unorthodox creativity, and the courage to trust his own instincts—even when everyone else doubted.   
 
This is the story of James Dyson. Learn how one decision can change everything for a whole family.

      <title>#219 Logan Ury: The Dating Myths You Need to Stop Believing</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/logan-ury/</link>
      <description>Most people date the wrong way. They chase the spark, mistake attraction for compatibility, and expect their partners to read their minds. Then they wonder why relationships don’t last. Logan Ury thinks about dating differently. As the Director of Relationship Science at Hinge, she’s spent years studying what actually makes relationships work. Her findings will change the way you think about attraction, communication, and commitment. In this conversation, Logan reveals why the spark is overrated, how to optimize your dating profile, and the one thing (actually, 8) you must do after every first date. We break down attachment theory, orbiting, polyamory, and having hard conversations in a healthy way. We get answers to questions like: "what’s an appropriate age gap?" and "what to say if you’re not interested after a date?" Plus, Logan shares how she made the decision to be with her husband and the importance of “other significant others.”   
 
If you want to stop wasting time on the wrong people and start building something real, this episode is for you.

      <title>#218 Outliers: Estée Lauder — A Success Story </title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-estee-lauder/</link>
      <description>Most people hear "Estée Lauder" and think of cosmetics—lipstick, perfume, face cream. But the real story isn’t just about makeup—it’s about a woman being an unstoppable force. 

Estée Lauder didn’t just build a beauty brand; she rewrote the rules of an industry. She turned rejection into fuel, defied industry gatekeepers, and transformed a homemade face cream into a multi-billion-dollar global powerhouse. 

When department stores refused to stock her products, she created a demand they couldn’t ignore. When experts said women wouldn’t spend $115 on face cream, she proved them wrong. When competitors copied her formulas, she didn’t fight them—she outmaneuvered them. Her real genius wasn’t in chemistry, but in understanding human psychology, persistence, and the power of storytelling. 

This is the story of Estée Lauder. 

Make sure to stick around at the end for my reflections and thoughts.

      <title>#217 Josh Wolfe: Human Advantage in the World of AI </title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/josh-wolfe-2/</link>
      <description>While Silicon Valley chases unicorns, Josh Wolfe hunts for something far more elusive: scientific breakthroughs that could change civilization. As co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital, he's looking for the kind of science that turns impossible into inevitable. Josh doesn’t just invest in the future—he sees it coming before almost anyone else. 
 
In this conversation, we explore: 

The rapid evolution of AI and potential bottlenecks slowing its growth 

The geopolitical battle for technological dominance and rise of sovereign AI models 

How advances in automation, robotics, and defence are shifting global power dynamics 

Josh's unfiltered thoughts on Tesla and Elon Musk 

AI's revolution of medical research 

Parenting in a tech-dominated world 

How AI is forcing us to rethink creativity, intellectual property, and human intelligence itself 

Why the greatest risk isn't AI itself—but our ability to separate truth from noise 

 
Despite the challenges ahead, Josh remains profoundly optimistic about human potential. He believes technology isn't replacing what makes us human—it's amplifying it. This episode will challenge how you think about innovation, risk, and the forces shaping our future. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, you can't afford to miss it. 
 
Josh Wolfe co-founded Lux Capital to support scientists and entrepreneurs who pursue counter-conventional solutions to the most vexing puzzles of our time. He previously worked in investment banking at Salomon Smith Barney and in capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Josh is a columnist with Forbes and Editor for the Forbes/Wolfe Emerging Tech Report.

      <title>#216 Outliers: Andrew Mellon – America’s Secret Banker</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-andrew-mellon/</link>
      <description>He was the strangest titan America ever produced: a whisper-quiet banker who turned systematic thinking into a superpower, building an industrial empire while barely raising his voice above a murmur. Andrew Mellon's story isn't just about money—it's about how patience, observation, and positioning can create more wealth than charisma ever could. But when the Great Depression hit, the very qualities that made him rich made him the perfect villain for a nation demanding change. 

Whether you're building a business, investing in the future, or seeking insights on strategic decision-making, Mellon's story reveals the power of patience, positioning, and playing the long game.

This podcast is for information purposes only and draws primarily from two foundational books: David Cannadine's 'Mellon: An American Life', the first comprehensive published biography of Andrew W. Mellon, which masterfully chronicles his journey from shy Pittsburgh boy to industrial titan, Treasury Secretary, and philanthropist. The second source, 'Thomas Mellon and His Times', written by Andrew's father Thomas Mellon himself provides invaluable firsthand insights into the immigrant experience and the formation of the Mellon family's business philosophy in America. If this story captured your interest, we highly recommend both works – Cannadine's for its thorough examination of Andrew's profound impact on American business, politics, and philanthropy, and Thomas Mellon's autobiography for its intimate portrait of the family's rise from immigrant farmers to financial powerhouses in both nineteenth- and twentieth-century Pittsburgh.

      <itunes:summary>He was the strangest titan America ever produced: a whisper-quiet banker who turned systematic thinking into a superpower, building an industrial empire while barely raising his voice above a murmur. Andrew Mellon's story isn't just about money—it's about how patience, observation, and positioning can create more wealth than charisma ever could. But when the Great Depression hit, the very qualities that made him rich made him the perfect villain for a nation demanding change. 

Whether you're building a business, investing in the future, or seeking insights on strategic decision-making, Mellon's story reveals the power of patience, positioning, and playing the long game.

      <title>#215 David Heacock: Managing and Marketing a $250M Business</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/david-heacock/</link>
      <description>Imagine leaving a six‐figure Wall Street salary behind to chase a single, daring idea. In this episode, David Heacock shows you how he turned a basic product into a $250M empire. At 29, he left Wall Street to bet on air filters. That bet transformed into Filterbuy, now a $250 million direct-to-consumer manufacturer serving more than 7 million customers through a ruthlessly efficient operation. Today we talk about what actually matters when building a business, balancing obsession with family life, selling on Amazon, what he’d do differently if starting over, and the freight decision he calls his biggest mistake. Whether you’re starting a business, scaling one, or simply looking for insights on hiring, managing, or making bold decisions, David shares the lessons that helped him build his empire. 
 
David Heacock is the founder and CEO of Filterbuy. Before revolutionizing the air filter industry, he traded options at Goldman Sachs from 2005-2012. 

If you’re driven by bold decisions and value hard-won lessons, this conversation is your playbook. Don’t miss out on the insights that could redefine your own path to success.

      <title>#214 Outliers: Timothy Eaton — The Original ‘Everything Store’</title>
      <link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/outliers-timothy-eaton/</link>
      <description>I’ve learned as much from reading biographies as from interviewing amazing people. That’s why we’re starting 'Lessons from Outliers.' 

Every other week, we'll study an outlier who did remarkable work. From industrialists who reimagined commerce to the irreverent personalities who challenged the foundations of their fields, we'll explore what they did and how they did it. We can learn something from everyone.  
 
We're starting Outliers with Timothy Eaton, a Canadian name that might not be familiar to many listeners today, but his innovations fundamentally changed retail and how we shop. This episode is about how he built that empire, the principles that drove its success, and the forces that eventually brought it all crashing down. 

Whether you're building a business, leading a team, or trying to understand how great companies rise and fall, Timothy Eaton's story offers timeless lessons about innovation, trust, and the true price of success. You'll learn why even the mightiest empires can crumble when they forget the principles that built them and why success—no matter how massive—must be earned and re-earned daily. 

(01:55) Introduction
(05:04) The Vision
(06:16) Timothy’s Early Years
(09:28) The System
(12:17) The Innovation Engine
(14:18) The Scale Game
(18:08) The Platform Play
(19:32) The Leadership Philosophy
(20:48) The Succession
(22:21) Retail as Entertainment
(23:14) The Western Expansion
(25:12) Building the National Network
(26:05) Creating the Corporate Family
(26:43) The Pinnacle of Power
(27:43) The Inherited Crown
(28:33) The Comfortable Plateau
(31:33) The Weight of Tradition
(33:12) The Profit Paradox
(34:02) The Identity Crisis
(34:51) The Final Chapter

This podcast is for information purposes only and draws primarily from two excellent books: ‘The Eatons: The Rise and Fall of Canada's Royal Family’ by Rod McQueen, which chronicles the Eaton family history and the company’s journey from beginning to end, and ‘Timothy Eaton and the Rise of His Department Store’ by Joy L. Santiuk, which focuses on the founder’s life.

Whether you're building a business, leading a team, or trying to understand how great companies rise and fall, Timothy Eaton's story offers timeless lessons about innovation, trust, and the true price of success. You'll learn why even the mightiest empires can crumble when they forget the principles that built them and why success—no matter how massive—must be earned and re-earned daily.

      <title>#213 Mickey Drexler: The Art of Selling with Retail's Merchant Prince</title>
      <description>This episode will transform how you think about style, aspiration, and the art of knowing what people want before they know it themselves. From working in department stores to advising Steve Jobs on Apple’s retail strategy when it didn’t have retail at all, Drexler’s career traces the evolution of American retail itself: from local shops to mall dominance, from catalog to digital, from mass market to personalization. Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur, a retail enthusiast, or someone looking to build a brand that stands the test of time, Mickey shares invaluable insights on what separates truly successful brands from the rest.

﻿Mickey Drexler is the chairman of Alex Mill. Before that, he was the CEO of J. Crew and sat on the Board of Directors of Apple. He founded Old Navy and Madewell, and served as the CEO of Gap from 1983–2002.

Learn why gaining real-world insights—and not just reports or data—is crucial to staying ahead of the competition.

      <title>#211 Codie Sanchez: Your Blueprint to Financial Freedom</title>
      <description>Whether you’re looking to increase your income, start a side business, or completely transform your financial future, Codie Sanchez will break down exactly what separates those who successfully build wealth from those who stay stuck. This conversation is packed with immediately actionable insights covering the biggest myths around money, the difference between acquiring and keeping money, the rich versus broke mindset and how it changes everything, non obvious lessons on negotiating, and more. Plus, we talk about the single most important thing to know about building financial freedom—and it’s not what you think it is.



After spending nearly two decades on Wall Street, Codie Sanchez struck out on her own and has been buying and investing in businesses since 2012. She now runs a holding company of small and medium-sized businesses. Her unique focus is on “boring businesses” like laundromats and lawn care services. Sanchez is also the author of Main Street Millionaire: How to Make Extraordinary Wealth in Ordinary Businesses.

Plus, we talk about the single most important thing to know about building financial freedom—and it’s not what you think it is.



After spending nearly two decades on Wall Street, Codie Sanchez struck out on her own and has been buying and investing in businesses since 2012. She now runs a holding company of small and medium-sized businesses. Her unique focus is on “boring businesses” like laundromats and lawn care services. Sanchez is also the author of Main Street Millionaire: How to Make Extraordinary Wealth in Ordinary Businesses.

      <title>#208 Ryan Holiday: How to Win the War with Yourself </title>
      <description>Ryan Holiday unpacks the subtle and not-so-subtle messages life sends us—and what happens when we ignore them. From mismatched tattoos and injured ankles, Ryan reflects on the lessons he’s learned about preparation, awareness, and humility. Using examples ranging from personal missteps to famous entrepreneurial gambles, this episode is a deep dive into the art of learning from experience, knowing when to listen, and the cost of stubbornness. Plus, Holiday revisits his roots to discuss how Stoic principles can guide you in navigating feedback, balancing ambition with self-awareness, and understanding the fine line between determination and delusion.

Holiday is a New York Times bestselling author. He has written over 10 books, covering both the fundamentals of Stoicism as well as key elements of modern-day marketing and media. His most recent release is Right Thing, Right Now. Holiday has been a guest on the podcast twice before.

        <![CDATA[<p>Ryan Holiday unpacks the subtle and not-so-subtle messages life sends us—and what happens when we ignore them. From mismatched tattoos and injured ankles, Ryan reflects on the lessons he’s learned about preparation, awareness, and humility. Using examples ranging from personal missteps to famous entrepreneurial gambles, this episode is a deep dive into the art of learning from experience, knowing when to listen, and the cost of stubbornness. Plus, Holiday revisits his roots to discuss how Stoic principles can guide you in navigating feedback, balancing ambition with self-awareness, and understanding the fine line between determination and delusion.</p>
<p>Holiday is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author<em>. </em>He has written over 10 books, covering both the fundamentals of Stoicism as well as key elements of modern-day marketing and media. His most recent release is <em>Right Thing, Right Now</em>. Holiday has been a guest on the podcast <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/ryan-holiday/">twice</a> <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/ryan-holiday-2/">before</a>.</p>

      <title>#206 John Mackey: Building Whole Foods</title>
      <description>From near bankruptcy after a devastating flood to a $13.7 billion Amazon acquisition, Whole Foods founder John Mackey reveals how a small health food store became an empire that revolutionized American eating. 



Discover how a single near-death experience transformed a 25-year-old college dropout into the pioneer of the organic food movement. Mackey shares raw insights from the frontlines: how he turned hostile customers into evangelists, survived multiple extinction-level threats, and built a mission-driven billion-dollar business without compromising its soul.



John Mackey is the co-founder of Whole Foods Market, where he was the CEO of the company from 1980 to 2022. He is the author of the bestselling book, Conscious Capitalism.

      <title>#204 John Bragg: The Blueberry Billionaire</title>
      <description>From a tiny village, John Bragg quietly built an empire that controls half the world's wild blueberries and North America's largest private telecom network. In this rare interview, the famously private billionaire reveals how he defied conventional wisdom by transforming a small farm into two multi-billion-dollar giants. Discover the contrarian principles that helped Bragg dominate seemingly unrelated industries—from frozen foods to fiber optics—and build businesses designed to thrive for generations, not just quarters.

      <title>#203 Erin Wade: The Mac and Cheese Empire </title>
      <description>When Princeton-educated attorney Erin Wade left law to open a restaurant, she didn't just create award-winning comfort food—she engineered a revolutionary workplace culture. This conversation reveals how she transformed an Oakland mac and cheese restaurant into a laboratory for modern management principles.

Wade shares her groundbreaking 'color code of conduct' system (now adopted globally) and her radical approach to open-book management. A masterclass in building culture, solving industry-wide challenges, and leading with precision rather than convention.

      <title>#201 April Dunford: The Marketing Expert</title>
      <description>Former IBM executive April Dunford reveals the sophisticated frameworks behind market leadership. This isn't about marketing tactics but how category leaders reshape markets to their advantage.

      <title>#199 Esther Perel: Cultivating Desire </title>
      <description>Few episodes in The Knowledge Project’s nine-year history have impacted people’s relationships and lives more than when Esther Perel shared her infinite wisdom for the first time in 2019.



Shane and Esther discuss how the stories you tell yourself shape how you see the world (and what to do about that), the important conversations to have at the beginning of a relationship, the most common arguments couples have and how to prevent them, what to say to a partner if the relationship isn’t working out, the relationship between desire, love, and pleasure, and so much more. Plus, the conversation starts out on an interesting note: Esther Perel shares stories about her parents surviving the Holocaust and how their experiences shaped her childhood and continue to shape her life today.



(This episode is a replay of one of our most popular episodes ever and was recorded in 2019.)

      <title>#197 Michaeleen Doucleff: The 4 Biggest Mistakes Parents Make </title>
      <description>What ancient wisdom and modern science reveal about raising exceptional children. Through years of anthropological research and scientific inquiry, NPR correspondent Michaeleen Doucleff uncovers the counterintuitive principles that shape human development across cultures.

This isn't about quick fixes or parenting hacks—it's a deep examination of how successful cultures have developed emotionally intelligent, capable humans for generations. Essential insights for leaders who understand that raising children, like building great organizations, requires sophisticated systems thinking and proven frameworks.

      <title>#196 Brent Beshore: Business Brilliance and Happiness at Home</title>
      <description>Succeeding in both life and business is very difficult. The skills needed to scale a company often clash with those required to cultivate a thriving home life. Yet, Brent Beshore seems to have cracked the code—or at least he's actively working on it. In this conversation, he spills his secrets on excelling in both arenas.

This episode is split into two parts: the first 45 minutes covers life and how to be a better person. Brent opens up about the evolution of his marriage, physical health, and inner life.

The rest of the episode focuses on business. Shane and Beshore discuss private equity, how to hire (and when to fire) CEOs, incentives, why debt isn’t a good thing in an unpredictable world, stewardship versus ownership, and why personality tests are so important for a functional organization.After beginning his career as an entrepreneur, Brent Beshore founded Permanent Equity in 2007 and leads the firm as CEO. He works with investors and operators to evaluate new investment opportunities.

      <title>#195 Morgan Housel: Get Rich, Stay Rich</title>
      <description>The skills it takes to get rich are drastically different from the skills it takes to stay rich. 

Few understand this phenomenon more than Morgan Housel. He's identified unique lessons about wealth, happiness, and money by studying the world's richest families and learning what they did to build their wealth and just how quickly they squandered it all.In this conversation, Shane and Housel discuss various aspects of risk-taking, wealth accumulation, and financial independence. 

Morgan explains the importance of understanding personal financial goals and the dangers of social comparison, lets everyone in on his personal financial “mistake” that instantly made him sleep better at night, and why the poorest people in the world disproportionately play the lottery—and why it makes sense that they do. They also touch on the influence of upbringing on financial behaviors, the difference between being rich and wealthy, and the critical role of compounding in financial success. Of course, we can’t have a writer as good as Morgan Housel on the podcast and not ask him about his process, so Housel concludes with insights into storytelling, his writing processes, and the importance of leading by example in teaching financial values to children.

Morgan Housel is a partner at Collaborative Fund. Previously, he was an analyst at The Motley Fool. He is a two-time winner of the Best in Business Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers and was selected by the Columbia Journalism Review for the Best Business Writing anthology. He's the author of two books: The Psychology of Money and Same as Ever.

        <![CDATA[<p>The skills it takes to <em>get</em> rich are drastically different from the skills it takes to <em>stay </em>rich. </p>
<p>Few understand this phenomenon more than Morgan Housel. He's identified unique lessons about wealth, happiness, and money by studying the world's richest families and learning what they did to build their wealth and just how quickly they squandered it all.<br>In this conversation, Shane and Housel discuss various aspects of risk-taking, wealth accumulation, and financial independence. </p>
<p>Morgan explains the importance of understanding personal financial goals and the dangers of social comparison, lets everyone in on his personal financial “mistake” that instantly made him sleep better at night, and why the poorest people in the world disproportionately play the lottery—and why it makes sense that they do. They also touch on the influence of upbringing on financial behaviors, the difference between being rich and wealthy, and the critical role of compounding in financial success. Of course, we can’t have a writer as good as Morgan Housel on the podcast and not ask him about his process, so Housel concludes with insights into storytelling, his writing processes, and the importance of leading by example in teaching financial values to children.</p>
<p>Morgan Housel is a partner at Collaborative Fund. Previously, he was an analyst at The Motley Fool. He is a two-time winner of the Best in Business Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers and was selected by the Columbia Journalism Review for the Best Business Writing anthology. He's the author of two books: <em>The Psychology of Money</em> and <em>Same as Ever</em>.</p>

      <title>Top Performance Psychologist: What it Takes to Win | Dr. Jim Loehr</title>
      <description>What if reaching the next level of success wasn't determined by another skill, degree, or course but by something that changed on the inside? That's what Dr. Jim Loehr believes, and in this episode, he reveals everything he knows about mental toughness and winning the mind game. 



Shane and Loehr discuss the radical importance of the stories you tell yourself—including how they can damage your kids—and how to change the negative stories you believe. Loehr also shares the best reflection questions to ask yourself to reveal personal blindspots, the importance of rituals for calming anxiety and performing under pressure, and how the best in the world use their recovery time effectively. Dr. Jim Loehr is a world-renowned performance psychologist and author of 16 books. Based on his more than 30 years of experience and applied research, Dr. Loehr believes the single most important factor in successful achievement, personal fulfillment, and life satisfaction is the strength of one’s character. He possesses a master's and doctorate in psychology and is a full member of the American Psychological Association.

      <title>Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Diet Essentials For Healthy Living</title>
      <description>Dr. Rhonda Patrick explores the intricate world of nutrition and health. 



Dr. Patrick provides a deep dive into the role micronutrients play in our daily health, detailing how deficiencies and insufficiencies in vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids can lead to serious health issues over time. 



Shane and Dr. Patrick also discuss the science behind deliberate heat exposure. She outlines the optimal sauna conditions—temperature, duration, and frequency—necessary for these health benefits and explains the physiological mechanisms.



Rhonda Patrick has a Ph.D. in biomedical science and a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry/chemistry from the University of California, San Diego. She has done extensive research on aging, cancer, and nutrition.



(00:00) Intro

(04:40) A philosophy for nutrition

(15:36) Micronutrients through supplements vs. food

(25:43) Wild-caught vs. farm-raised fish

(28:44) Organic vs. non-organic vegetables

(36:14) On macronutrients

(40:20) How protein levels differ in different foods

(45:27) The best morning smoothie recipe

(54:48) Dr. Patrick grades Shane's "GOAT" smoothie recipe

(59:14) Grass-fed vs. non-grass fed

(01:04:40) On vitamin D (Is sunscreen killing us more than the sun?)

(01:19:48) Deliberate heat and cold exposure

(01:44:27) Top three behavioral and diet interventions for life and health improvements

      <title>#190 Brad Jacobs: How To Build a Billion Dollar Company</title>
      <description>Brad Jacobs doesn't just build big companies – he builds industry giants. As the founder of eight multibillion-dollar companies, he's cracked the code on scaling businesses from zero to billions. In this conversation, the secrets he's earned over decades.



You'll discover where billion-dollar opportunities are hiding in plain sight, how to spot massive trends years before your competitors, and the most crucial factor determining a company's success.



Currently serving as Chairman and CEO of QXO, Jacobs brings a mathematician's precision and a musician's creativity to scaling businesses. His track record speaks for itself: every company he's founded has reached billion-dollar status or beyond.



(00:00) Intro

 (04:44) The future of AI

 (07:21) How to think rationally

 (08:48) The major trend

 (10:57) The research process

 (13:29) On asking better questions

 (19:35) On rearranging your brain

 (22:23) On music, math, simplicity, and business

 (32:26) Leverage, debt, and optionality

 (35:11) What it takes to take contrarian bets

 (40:45) Confidence and parents

 (50:21) Why negative-only feedback is detrimental for employees

 (56:14) Money lessons

 (58:13) A deep dive on M&amp;A (Jacobs' secret sauce to growing his companies)

 (01:07:51) Questions to immediately get to know anyone

 (01:11:14) On boards and board meetings

 (01:16:57) On decision-making

 (01:23:37) The role of capital markets

 (01:25:41) The type of person you don't want to hire

 (01:31:16) The best capital allocators

 (01:33:53) Biggest lesson Jacobs learned from the past year

 (01:37:20) On success

      <title>#189 Chris Davis: Three Generations of Wealth</title>
      <description>Most families who obtain immense wealth squander it by the third generation. But Chris Davis comes from a family whose grandfather and father all became independently wealthy of each other, and Davis has done the same. How does that keep happening? In this conversation, we find out.  Shane and Chris discuss life and investment lessons he learned from his father and grandfather, why writing is more important to clarify one's thinking no matter who's reading it, and the surprising benefit of reading physical newspapers and wearing ties to work. Davis also shares his value-investing philosophy, what he learned from working with and meeting Charlie Munger, and what parents can do to raise kids who aren't entitled. Davis talks about his alcohol drink tracker and why it's important to him, why he never puts himself in situations where envy can grow, and the insights from Warren Buffett's key letter about why investment managers underperform.  Chris Davis is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway and The Coca-Cola Company. Davis is Chairman of Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc., an independent investment management firm founded in 1969. Davis joined Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc. in 1989 as a financial analyst, and in 1995, he became a portfolio manager of the firm’s flagship funds.

        <![CDATA[<p>Most families who obtain immense wealth squander it by the third generation. But Chris Davis comes from a family whose grandfather and father all became independently wealthy of each other, and Davis has done the same. How does that keep happening? In this conversation, we find out.<br> <br> Shane and Chris discuss life and investment lessons he learned from his father and grandfather, why writing is more important to clarify one's thinking no matter who's reading it, and the surprising benefit of reading physical newspapers and wearing ties to work. Davis also shares his value-investing philosophy, what he learned from working with and meeting Charlie Munger, and what parents can do to raise kids who aren't entitled. Davis talks about his alcohol drink tracker and why it's important to him, why he never puts himself in situations where envy can grow, and the insights from Warren Buffett's key letter about why investment managers underperform.<br> <br> Chris Davis is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway and The Coca-Cola Company. Davis is Chairman of Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc., an independent investment management firm founded in 1969. Davis joined Davis Selected Advisers-NY, Inc. in 1989 as a financial analyst, and in 1995, he became a portfolio manager of the firm’s flagship funds.</p> <p><strong>Watch the episode on YouTube</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/c/theknowledgeproject/videos</p> <p><strong>Newsletter</strong> - I share timeless insights and ideas you can use at work and home.

      <title>#188 Bryan Johnson: Five Habits for Longer Living</title>
      <description>What can you do (or avoid) tomorrow to guarantee you can live longer?  In this episode, Bryan Johnson reveals the five simple disciplines you can start doing to live healthier and longer. Johnson shares what his daily routine looks like, the ins and outs of his experimentation process, and why he gave his father plasma.  Johnson also opens up about the constant hate he receives from people online, how he deals with it all, and what he wishes he'd known when he sold his company.  Bryan Johnson is the world's most measured human. Johnson sold his company to PayPal in 2013. Through Project Blueprint, Johnson has achieved metabolic health equal to the top 1.5% of 18 year olds, inflammation 66% lower than the average 10 year old, and reduced his speed of aging by the equivalent of 31 years.  Johnson is also the founder of Kernel, creator of the world’s first mainstream non-invasive neuroimaging system; and OS Fund, where he invested in the predictable engineering of atoms, molecules, and organisms.

      <title>#183 Paul Assaiante: Learning to Face Your Fears</title>
      <description>When Paul Assaiante announced his retirement from coaching the men's squash team at Trinity College in Connecticut earlier this year, it marked the end of the most successful run for any coach in the history of college athletics.
 During his tenure, Assaiante guided Trinity to 17 national titles, including 13 consecutive championships and 252 wins in a row from 1999 to 2011.
 On this episode of The Knowledge Project, Assaiante draws on his 30 years of coaching to discuss the lessons he learned during his career. These lessons include how to conquer fear and anxiety, why safety is actually found when facing adversity, the importance of practice, and what's keeping you from reaching your goals.
 Assaiante is also the author of the 2012 book, Run to the Roar: Coaching to Overcome Fear. Listen and learn.

      <title>#182 Todd Herman: Unleashing Your Secret Identity</title>
      <description>We all inhabit different identities throughout our day. Perhaps we’re entrepreneurs or employees, mothers or fathers, athletes or CEOs. But how can you harness the strengths of these different identities to get the best out of yourself? And can these different identities be used to get through tough times? Todd Herman calls on more than two decades of experience working with top performers on performance, strategy, mindset, and execution to discuss his thoughts on peak performance, the value of patience, the fear that prevents us from performing our best, imposter syndrome, and how he worked with Kobe Bryant to build the legendary alter-ego of The Black Mamba.  Herman has worked with elite athletes, peak performers, and entrepreneurial leaders for over 22 years. He helps them achieve their most ambitious goals by becoming more resilient, creative, confident, and courageous. He is also the author of the bestselling book The Alter Ego Effect. --

      <title>#181 Dr. Gio Valiante (Part 2): Failure and Success</title>
      <description>In the second of a special two-part episode, performance psychologist Dr. Gio Valiante calls on his vast experience working with some of the world’s top athletes and entrepreneurs. Shane and Dr. Valiante discuss thoughts on failure and the fear that holds you back from making the most of your talent, shifting from an ego orientation to a mastery orientation, common misperceptions about success and failure, and how we learn when it’s time to cut our losses and move on to a different challenge.   Valiante is regarded as one of the most successful performance coaches in the world. He’s worked extensively with golfers on the PGA and LPGA Tours, Olympic athletes, and leading figures in NCAA football and the NFL, where he served as the Head Performance Coach of the Buffalo Bills. He has also logged over 5,000 hours coaching some of the most sophisticated investors in the world, including hedge fund manager Steve Cohen.   Listen to the first part of this special episode on the Farnam Street blog or wherever you listen to The Knowledge Project. --

He’s worked extensively with golfers on the PGA and LPGA Tours, Olympic athletes, and leading figures in NCAA football and the NFL, where he served as the Head Performance Coach of the Buffalo Bills.

      <title>#176: Dr. Leah Lagos and Joe Mazzulla: Control Your Heart, Conquer Your Stress</title>
      <description>Internationally renowned health and performance psychologist Dr. Leah Lagos discusses the concept of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and how you can improve your mental and physical health by using signals from your body to gain control over stress. She’s also joined on this episode by Head Coach of Boston Celtics, Joe Mazzulla, who has worked with Dr. Lagos on HRV training. He discusses how he uses techniques taught by Dr. Lagos to help him manage his HRV and lower stress levels during his first season as an NBA head coach in 2022.
 Dr. Lagos has served as a Clinical and Performance Psychologist in private practice for the past 14 years. She consults a global hedge fund as well as elite performers in entertainment, business, and sport.

      <title>#174 Rey Flemings: A Different Definition of Success</title>
      <description>Dubbed during his career as “The Man Who Knows What the World’s Richest People Want (and How To Get It),” Rey Flemings has years of experience dealing with success. He sees it every day as the co-founder and CEO of Myria, a company that provides concierge services to fewer than 100 elite clients with a combined wealth of over $400 billion. On this episode, Flemings discusses what he’s learned about wealth, money, success and happiness while on the job, how he makes impossible tasks possible, and what it was like to try and smuggle ventilators into New York City during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Flemings founded Myria in 2021 and has worked in the luxury services industry since 2017. He also served as the founder and CEO of Stripple, a web imagery monetization company, and CEO of Particle, an Internet services company acquired by Apple.  --

      <title>#171 Naval Ravikant: The Angel Philosopher (2017)</title>
      <description>No episode in the eight-year history of The Knowledge Project has made a bigger impact than when Naval Ravikant appeared on the show in 2017. Be it for longtime listeners who heard Naval when this episode first aired or for newer fans who missed Naval’s incredible insights, this is a must-listen to fans of The Knowledge Project and for those looking to hear from a deep thinker with an incredible wealth of insight.   On this episode Naval and Shane dive deep into reading habits, getting the best information from the most reliable sources, mental models for making critical high-stakes decisions, avoiding overcommitting and staying focused on the most important projects, how to facilitate better learning for our children and Naval’s definition for the meaning of life.  Naval Ravikant is the former CEO and co-founder of AngelList, a platform for startups, investors, and job seekers dedicated to democratizing the investment process. He has also invested in more than 100 companies, including Uber, Twitter, Yammer, and many others.  --

      <title>#167 Dr. Gina Poe: The Science of Better Sleep</title>
      <description>Dr. Gina Poe has spent nearly four decades studying the science of sleep, and how we can all get a better night’s rest by making some simple changes in our lives. In this episode Poe dives deep into what she’s learned about sleep during her career, including the stages of sleep, why you’re waking up in the middle of the night, why some people remember their dreams, the best bedtime routines, and the real-life consequences when you miss a night’s sleep.   Dr. Poe is a professor of Integrative Biology and Physiology at UCLA, where she is also the Director of the school’s Sleep and Memory Laboratory, which investigates the mechanisms by which sleep traits serve learning and memory consolidation.  --

      <title>#166 Kevin Kelly: Excellent Advice for Living</title>
      <description>When Kevin Kelly turned 68 years old, he began writing down notes and thoughts about all the lessons he’d learned in his life and the ones he wished he’d learned earlier. While those notes were originally intended for his young adult children, they eventually became the book Excellent Advice for Living: Wisdom I Wish I'd Known Earlier, which was released in May 2023. On this episode of the Knowledge Project, Kelly goes in-depth on some of the book’s most essential lessons, including learning, setting deadlines, perfection, forgiveness, living a meaningful life, reasoning, and so much more.  Kelly is the co-founder of the magazine Wired, which twice won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence while he served as publication’s Executive Editor during the 1990s. He is also the co-chair of The Long Now Foundation, a membership organization that champions long-term thinking, as well as the founder of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily for 20 years. He is also an artist as well as the author of 14 books.  --

      <title>Proven Strategies to Accelerate Growth, Productivity and Profits with George Stalk, Jr.</title>
      <description>George Stalk Jr., business strategist and author of the book Competing Against Time, reveals the surprising ways companies can harness the power of time to blow past competitors, boost productivity, and send profits soaring.
 Competing Against Time is the ONE book that Apple CEO Tim Cook makes all his executives read.
 In this episode, you’ll learn the proven ‘hardball’ strategies that market leaders like Toyota use to win and discover the counterintuitive approach of paying more to ship and manufacture faster – and how those time advantages translate into unassailable market dominance.
 George shares eye-opening examples of how relentlessly reducing time and variance through the entire value chain creates an avalanche of competitive advantages nearly impossible for rivals to copy. But it’s not just about speed – it’s about building a fast-moving, low-variance organization primed to adapt, innovate, and seize opportunities others can’t even see.
 Whether you’re a business leader, entrepreneur or ambitious professional, this episode will give you a radical new lens for gaining an unbeatable edge in any industry. After listening, you’ll never think about business strategy or competition the same way again.

      <title>#163 Jason Karp: Live A Healthier Life</title>
      <description>Jason Karp was living what he thought was a successful life in his 20s. He graduated near the top of his class from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and was well on his way to becoming a successful hedge fund manager. But when he noticed a series of health issues cropping up - including the frightening diagnosis that he would go blind by the age of 30 - he made a series of life-altering decisions focused on his health and wellness. On this episode Karp dives deep into the changes he made that saved his life, and offers valuable insights into what you can do to live a healthier life.  Karp is the Founder and CEO of HumanCo., a private holding company that invests in and builds brands focused on healthier living and sustainability, including Snow Days, Cosmic Bliss, and Against The Grain. He also co-founded Hu Products and Hu Kitchen, and Hu is now one of the fastest growing snacking companies in the U.S. with a strict focus on transparent, simple ingredients to help everyone live a healthier life. Prior to founding Hu, Karp was the founder  CEO of Tourbillon Capital Partners, an investment fund that managed over $4 billion.

      <title>#162 Nathan Myhrvold</title>
      <description>Visionary technology and business leader Nathan Myhrvold just might be the most interesting person in the world, and in this episode of The Knowledge Project he dives deep into some of the most pressing questions facing our world today. Where will technology take us in the future? Should we trust artificial intelligence? Where have we gone wrong in protecting our planet? How do we reverse the effects of what we’ve already done? Myhrvold answers all these and much, much more.   Myhrvold is a prominent scientist, technologist, inventor, author, and food photographer, and the former Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft. He’s also the co-founder of patent portfolio developer Intellectual Ventures, the principal author of the culinary book Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking, part of a team that won first place at the World Barbecue Championships, and he completed his postdoctoral fellowship under legendary theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking.  --

      <description>Are you scrolling on your phone constantly? How badly do you crave that morning cup of coffee? Are you compulsively gambling, drinking, shopping, or even reading romance novels just to fall asleep?

She appeared in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma to discuss the addictive nature of social media, and she is the author of the 2021 New York Times bestseller Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence, which explores how to moderate compulsive overconsumption in a dopamine-overloaded world.  --

      <description>Acclaimed executive coach and leadership development specialist Carolyn Coughlin calls on more than a decade of experience to help you become a better listener.

Coughlin is a co-founder at Cultivating Leadership, a leadership development consultancy firm that helps leaders and organizations grow and lead in the face of complexity, ambiguity, and change. She also spent nine years with leadership consulting firm Kenning Associates and more than five years with McKinsey &amp; Company.  --

      <title>#153 Keith Creel: Lessons from Life on the Railroad</title>
      <description>Keith Creel calls on nearly a decade of experience working with the Canadian Pacific Railway to discuss his strategies for leadership and how he’s turned the company around over five years in charge.   We discuss all you need to know about the rail industry and how it affects our daily lives, what changes he sees coming in the future for the industry, how he thinks about leadership in times of change, and how Canadian Pacific secured a $27 billion deal to take over its rival, Kansas City Southern.   Creel became the President and CEO of Canadian Pacific in 2017, giving him executive control of one of the largest Class I rail systems in North America, with more than 13,000 miles of rail network stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 2021 he helped broker a deal that marked the first major merger in the railroad industry in the U.S. in two decades and created the first freight rail network linking Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.  --

      <title>#152 Tobi Lütke: Calm Progress</title>
      <description>My guest today is Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobi Lütke.  We discuss the differences between founders and professional managers, how he’s scaled with Shopify, the constant fight against bureaucracy, how he thinks about innovation in a large company, and how he manages to keep his head when everyone else is losing theirs.
  
 A coder at heart who emigrated from Germany to Canada two decades ago, Lütke co-founded the e-commerce giant Shopify in Ottawa in 2006. The Globe and Mail named Lütke "CEO of the Year" in November 2014,  and in May 2021 the company reported that it had more than 1.7 million businesses in approximately 175 countries using its platform. As of July 2022, Shopify is among the top 20 largest publicly traded Canadian companies by market capitalization, and the company’s total revenue for 2021 was $4.611 billion. Lütke previously appeared on Episode 41 of The Knowledge Project.

      <title>#151 Alan Mulally: The Power Of Working Together</title>
      <description>Widely regarded as one of the top business leaders of his generation, Alan Mulally joins the show to discuss the formation of his leadership strategy and how you can apply his lessons to your life and business. On this episode Mulally breaks down the principles of how a team can work together toward a larger goal, creating a culture of love by design, the role of the leader, what happens when people opt out of working together, how to use the ideas of working together in your family life, and so much more.   Mulally is perhaps best known as the former President and CEO of the Ford Motor Company, which was struggling during the late-2000s recession before Mulally used his teamwork-oriented philosophy to save the company. Under Mulally’s leadership from 2006-14, Ford was the only major car manufacturer to avoid a government bailout, and Mulally was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time. Prior to joining Ford, Mulally spent more than three decades at Boeing, where he eventually served as an Executive Vice President and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.  -- Want even more?

      <title>#149 Neil Pasricha: Simple Rules for Happiness</title>
      <description>Shane's guest on this episode of the show is New York Times bestselling author Neil Pasricha, who returns for his second appearance on The Knowledge Project.

      <title>#148 Kenneth Stanley: Set The Right Objectives</title>
      <description>Artificial intelligence researcher and author Kenneth Stanley has argued that “as soon as you create an objective, you ruin your ability to reach it.” So what should you consider when thinking about your objectives, and what will set you up for success? On this episode Stanley discusses how to set the right objectives for your life, why we’re too tied to accomplishments, what role accountability plays in our education system, the value of peer review,  why transformative innovations are always counter intuitive, and so much more.  Stanley is the co–author of Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,  as well as the former Head of Core AI Research at Uber AI and the Open-Endedness Team Leader at OpenAI. He has also served as the Charles Millican Professor in Computer Science at University of Central Florida.

      <title>#147 Reid Hoffman: Better Decisions, Fewer Mistakes</title>
      <description>Few figures have shaped the way we think about business over the past 20 years more than Reid Hoffman. The co-founder of LinkedIn and former PayPal executive is also a wildly successful venture capitalist, author and podcaster, but he didn’t get to his place as a Silicon Valley giant without making plenty of crucial decisions. On this episode Hoffman discusses lessons learned from decades spent as a hands-on operator and investor, including what he knows about scaling that others miss, the three principles of decision making, how to constantly evolve your learning pattern, and why the best leaders adapt to the crisis at hand.  Hoffman is perhaps best known for co-founding the professional networking site LinkedIn, which he started in 2003 and later sold for a reported $26.2 billion to Microsoft in 2016. Prior to founding LinkedIn, Hoffman was one of the first employees at PayPal, where he served as an executive vice president. He is also a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners, an investor in Airbnb, the author of a series of successful business books including Masters of Scale, and the host of the podcast of the same name.

      <title>#146 Barbara Tversky: Action Shapes Thought</title>
      <description>My guest today is acclaimed psychologist and longtime Stanford University professor Barbara Tversky who calls on her nearly 50 years in the field of cognitive psychology for an in-depth discussion about how our minds work.
 We discuss the Nine Laws of Cognition, why action shapes thought, how the language we use changes what we think, tactics to communicate better on Zoom, why she dove into the work of Leonardo da Vinci, when to use charts and when to avoid them, the importance of perspective taking, learned knowledge vs. earned knowledge, and so much more.

      <title>#145 Les Snead: Building a Super Bowl Champion</title>
      <description>LA Rams General Manager Les Snead dives deep into some of the strategies that made the Rams a Super Bowl Champion, including assessing character, how to draft the right player, the complicated nature of trading players, how to build a team, hiring the right coach, hidden performance, why it’s so important to be relentlessly curious, and so much more.   A native of football-crazed Eufaula, Alabama, Snead served as a graduate assistant at Auburn University before he spent 14 years as an NFL scout for the Jacksonville Jaguars and Atlanta Falcons. He became the Rams’ GM in 2012 and over time built a reputation as an executive willing to make insightful draft picks as well as blockbuster trades, including his move to draft future Hall of Famer Aaron Donald in 2014 and to trade for superstars Von Miller and Matthew Stafford on the way to winning the Super Bowl in February.  --

      <title>#138 Luke Burgis: The Power of Mimetic Desire</title>
      <description>Is there really a straight line between you and the things you want in life? Entrepreneur and educator Luke Burgis goes deep on how understanding mimetic desire can help you better connect the dots between where you are now, and where you want to go. Burgis breaks down the theories behind mimetic desire and the teachings of René Girard, why all of our behaviors are imative, why we desire things we don’t need, and why this all leads to missing out on aspects of life that are far more meaningful and valuable.   Burgis has co-created and led four companies in wellness, consumer products, and technology. He’s currently Entrepreneur-in-Residence and Director of Programs at the Ciocca Center for Principled Entrepreneurship, where he also teaches business at The Catholic University of America. He is also the author of Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life. --

        <![CDATA[Is there really a straight line between you and the things you want in life? Entrepreneur and educator Luke Burgis goes deep on how understanding mimetic desire can help you better connect the dots between where you are now, and where you want to go. Burgis breaks down the theories behind mimetic desire and the teachings of René Girard, why all of our behaviors are imative, why we desire things we don’t need, and why this all leads to missing out on aspects of life that are far more meaningful and valuable.   Burgis has co-created and led four companies in wellness, consumer products, and technology. He’s currently Entrepreneur-in-Residence and Director of Programs at the Ciocca Center for Principled Entrepreneurship, where he also teaches business at The Catholic University of America. He is also the author of <em>Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life</em>. <p><strong>--</strong></p> <p><strong>Want even more?</strong> Members get early access, hand-edited transcripts, member-only episodes, and so much more.

      <title>#137 Justin Su'a: Peak Mental Performance</title>
      <description>Justin Su'a calls on more than a decade of working with the world’s top athletes to discuss how to improve your mental performance. Su’a explores the strategies you need to be your best mentally with lessons that resonate well beyond the world of sports — including how to connect and build trust, the relationship between consistency and intensity, the fragility of confidence, the difference between success and talent, how to raise the bar of your own performance, and so much more.
 Su'a has spent the past three years as the Head of Mental Performance for the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball, where he works with players to optimize their mental performance and perform under enormous pressure. He has also worked for the Boston Red Sox as well as the NFL’s Cleveland Browns, and as the Head of Mental Conditioning Department for the IMG Academy, which develops star athletes of the future. He’s also written two books on the subject of developing mental toughness in adolescents.

      <title>#132 Ret. Gen. Stanley McChrystal - The Essence of Leadership</title>
      <description>Retired United States Army General Stanley McChrystal calls on more than three decades of military experience to discuss the fundamental tenets of leadership, and practical advice for taking calculated risks and making important decisions. This wide-ranging conversation includes insights on mitigating risk, making decisions under uncertainty, why civilian leadership is tougher than military leadership, developing mental toughness, teaching discipline, and so much more.   A veteran of four U.S. wars in the Middle East, McChrystal was a four-star general best known for his command of Joint Special Operations Command from 2003-08, when he oversaw special operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. His troops were responsible for both the capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the 2006 death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. After retiring from the military in 2010 he joined Yale University as a Jackson Institute for Global Affairs senior fellow, and in 2011 he founded a consultancy firm, McChrystal Group, which helps organizations tap into human potential in service of stronger business outcomes.    --  Want even more?

      <title>#121 Walter Isaacson: Curiosity Fuels Creativity</title>
      <description>What do Steve Jobs, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin and Jennifer Doudna all have in common? Celebrated journalist and author Walter Isaacson calls upon his years of research to explain how curiosity has always fueled creativity among history’s greatest innovators, and how each of those individuals shaped the world around them. On this episode Issacson dives deep into the curious obsessions of Jobs, da Vinci’s ability to develop a brilliant mind, Ada Lovelace and how she developed the algorithm, and how Doudna’s work with gene editing could shape the future to come.
  
 A journalist by trade, Issacson served as the editor of Time and then chairman and CEO of CNN before eventually spending 15 years as president and CEO of the Aspen Institute, the international research institute and think tank. Isaacson has also written bestselling biographies on Jobs, da Vinci, Franklin and Albert Einstein, and in 2021 released his latest biography, The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race.

      <title>#119 Todd Simkin: Making Better Decisions</title>
      <description>Todd Simkin calls on experiences from his lengthy career in financial services and educating traders to help Shane understand how to make better decisions. Simkin breaks down all the influences that go into how and why we make decisions, why financial decisions are different than inter-personal ones, the strategies involved with teaching other people to make better decisions, what he looks for when he’s hiring, the value of asking the right questions, and so much more.
 Simkin is Associate Director at Susquehanna International Group, a privately held trading and technology firm. During his 25 years with the company he has held a variety of roles, including responsibility for SIG’s firm-wide education and trader development, where he taught the company’s new traders what questions to ask and what criteria to weigh before making hugely impactful decisions for the firm.

      <description>Kat Cole discusses how "the power of possible" guided her from a part-time job as a hostess at a Hooters restaurant to one of the most respected business leaders in America.

      <title>#86 BJ Fogg: The Science of Lasting Change</title>
      <description>Stanford behavior scientist BJ Fogg reveals why everything you know about habits is wrong – and the surprising truth about how they form. 



Fogg shares his groundbreaking research, showing that emotions, not repetition, create lasting habits. Drawing from over a decade of research at Stanford's Behavior Design Lab, he explains his proven three-phase system for breaking hard-to-change behaviors, how to harness your environment to make change effortless, and why tiny actions lead to remarkable transformation.



You'll learn why motivation isn't the key to change, how to redesign your environment for automatic success (including his ingenious "super fridge" method), and the scientific way to make or break any habit in just 5 days. Whether you're trying to build better habits or break challenging ones, this conversation provides an evidence-based blueprint for lasting personal change.

Finally, Gabriel reveals the hidden ways companies track your data online and shares simple, practical steps you can take right now to protect your digital privacy without sacrificing convenience.

      <title>#41 Tobi Lütke: The Trust Battery</title>
      <description>Today, I interview fellow Ottawan and the founder and CEO of Shopify, Tobi Lütke. In case you’re still new to the internet, Shopify is the largest ecommerce platform that allows people to easily set up online storefronts to sell everything from jewelry to surfing lessons.
 Shopify began as a simple two man operation selling snowboards online, but it became clear rather quickly that it had the potential to grow into much more. Now Shopify employs more than 4,000 people and supports more than 600,000 businesses online. It’s a remarkable story, with a remarkable leader at the helm.
 There was so much I wanted to talk to Tobi about that we hop around quite a bit. Here are a few of the topics we discuss:
  Tobi’s thoughts on how video games helped him prepare to run a company
 How selling snowboards online slowly transitioned to the creation of one of the biggest tech companies in the world
 Why Tobi intentionally headquartered Shopify outside of Silicon Valley and how that fits into his overall growth strategy
 One of the most underrated resources Tobi leans on to mine nuggets of wisdom when trying to get insight or solve a problem
 The hard and valuable lessons Tobi learned as they scaled from a 2 employee company to a 4,000 employee company
 What the “Tobi test” is, and how it helps Shopify team members become more adaptable, unified and prepared when things go haywire
 How employees use the “trust battery” and how it fosters better teamwork, communication, and productivity throughout the company
 The benefits of hiring employees in a “secondary market” as opposed to a “primary market” and how that contributes to the unique culture at Shopify
 Tobi’s decision-making process and his philosophy on making quick vs analytic decisions
 Tobi’s unusual morning routine that gets him in the right mindset to tackle the day
 His optimistic view of AI and machine learning and how they will impact the way we do things in the future
  And more…
 Whether you’re building a business of your own, want to create a more dynamic and unified culture at work, or just like hearing entrepreneur war stories, this episode will not disappoint.

      <title>#40 Ben Thompson: Thriving in a Digital World</title>
      <description>Today’s guest is Stratechery author and founder Ben Thompson. If you’re an investor in Silicon Valley, work at a tech start-up, or just love to geek out on technology and business analysis, odds are good that Stratechery is on your short list of must-read blogs.
 What started as a side project, quickly ballooned into one of the most influential tech blogs on the web. The New York Times called Stratechery, “one of the most interesting sources of analysis on any subject.”
 I agree.
 In this interview, Ben and I cover a lot of ground. Here are a few of the things we discuss:
  Learn once and for all how to pronounce Stratechery. :)
 How Ben’s business model was developed and how he massaged it over the years to become what it is today
 The one metric Ben looks at each day to gauge the health of his business
 How Ben deals with people who rip off his work and pass it off as their own
 Ben’s thoughts on pricing, free trials, content and other important aspects of online membership sites
 How Ben structures his day to churn out such incredible content so consistently
 How Ben handles being wrong on his site, and his process for screening his work for confirmation bias
 How the internet has changed the traditional view of supply and demand, and what companies should do about it
 What Ben would teach an MBA class about internet strategy (if you do any business online, you need to hear this)
 What it would take for a start-up to overtake Google or Apple, and the vulnerabilities that all companies share, no matter how big or profitable
 The new era of technology and how companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Amazon are doing it right (and what you can do in your own business to take full advantage)
  This is one of the most jam-packed interviews I’ve done on the Knowledge Project. Ben’s answers are so thoughtful and informative that you’re going to want to have a notebook handy.

      <itunes:summary>Today’s guest is Stratechery author and founder Ben Thompson. If you’re an investor in Silicon Valley, work at a tech start-up, or just love to geek out on technology and business analysis, odds are good that Stratechery is on your short list of must-read blogs.
 What started as a side project, quickly ballooned into one of the most influential tech blogs on the web. The New York Times called Stratechery, “one of the most interesting sources of analysis on any subject.”

      <title>#39 Tyler Cowen: Thinking About Thinking</title>
      <description>There are only a handful of websites that I read religiously. One of those is MarginalRevolution.com, started by my next guest, Tyler Cowen.
 Other than hosting one of the most popular economic blogs in the world, Tyler is also an economics professor at George Mason University, a regular New York Times columnist, and the author of over a dozen books, including  Average is Over, and  The Complacent Class.
 With such a prolific guest, it’s no wonder that we cover a lot of ground. In this episode, we discuss:
  How the future of labor will look drastically different than it does today, and what we can do to future-proof our livelihood
 The pros and cons of virtual reality and the impact it could have on society
 The fate of newspapers and how information will be more and more “bundled” according to our tastes and preferences
 Race relations in the world, and how in many ways we’ve taken discouraging steps backwards
 How we’re losing touch with the physical world, and some of the symptoms that indicate that we could be in for a rough ride
 What Tyler suggests doing to improve decision making and how important (and rare) that skill will be in the coming years
 Tyler’s advice to parents about how to foster resilience, tenacity and internal drive in their children
 Tyler’s “quake books” and the reading process he’s developed over the years that keeps him sharp
 Why giving books as gifts can be dangerous
 The one skill every person should possess before Googling anything
 What playing competitive chess as a child taught Tyler about how he thinks and views the world today
  And much more, including Tyler’s thoughts on minimum wage, bitcoin, and his favorite television programs.
 If you want to upgrade your thinking so you’re prepared for the brave new world that’s rapidly developing before our eyes, you won’t want to miss this fascinating episode.

      <title>#38 Ali Almossawi: Thinking in Algorithms</title>
      <description>My guest for this short episode of The Knowledge Project is a man who wears many hats.
 Ali Almossawi is a San Francisco-based author of books on critical thinking and computer science education, and the creator of An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments. He is also a principal engineer at Apple and was formerly employed as a data visualization engineer by Mozilla.
 His books have been read by 3 million readers, translated into 20 languages, and have sold over a quarter million copies in print.
 This interview is only 20 minutes along, but there was a lot I wanted to cover, so we move pretty fast. Specifically, we cover:
  The unique format Ali chooses when writing a book to help people understand the concepts more deeply
 The place for empathy in algorithmic thinking and how we can be more empathetic in our daily interactions with each other
 Ali’s note taking process and how he tracks the ideas and topics he’d like to explore
 Ali’s daily routine and the “algorithms” he uses to make the most of his day
 The single habit that has the most profound impact on Ali’s day to day
 The cost/benefit of sharing on social media and the impact it has on society as a whole
  And more.
 If you’ve ever wanted to improve the way you process information, think more clearly and make better decisions, you won’t want to miss this interview.

      <title>#37 Annie Duke: Getting Better by Being Wrong</title>
      <description>I have wanted to do this interview for a long time. On this episode, I am thrilled to have Annie Duke, former professional poker player and author of the new book,  Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts.
 Annie has a very interesting background that makes her uniquely qualified to speak about high-level decision making. As an author, speaker, world-class poker player, and academic in the fields of psychology and cognitive theory, Annie understands the intersection of luck, skill, and making decisions in uncertain, chaotic environments better than most people on the planet.
 This is a whirlwind of an episode, and we cover all kinds of fascinating topics, including:
  The strange circumstances that shifted Annie’s path from finishing a Ph.D. in linguistics to becoming a professional poker player
 What it was like to be a female poker player in a predominantly male sport (especially before poker had become socially acceptable)
 What drew Annie into such a high stakes, time-pressured environment and why she felt like poker was the perfect fit for her
 How her graduate work in psychology informed the way she approached the game of poker — and helped her rack up wins
 How she finds the signal in a very noisy stream of feedback
 The big mistakes Annie noticed other players making that were stalling their progress in the game but allowed her to make giant leaps forward
 The role that mental models played in her learning process (and which models Annie liked to lean on the most in a high stakes game)
 The power of surrounding yourself with people that can help you expand your circle of competence — and how that made all the difference in Annie’s development as a player
 Confirmatory and exploratory thought, and how one helps us to be “accurate” and one helps us to be “right.”
 The secret pact you should be making with the people who are closest to you
  And so much more.
 This episode is just under two hours long, but there’s no fat in it. Annie delivers a masterclass in making the smartest decisions we can, even when our hubris insists otherwise. Do some finger stretches before hitting play, because you’re going to be taking some serious notes.
 Please enjoy the interview!

On this episode, I am thrilled to have Annie Duke, former professional poker player and author of the new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DG9LQF/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B074DG9LQF&amp;linkId=5367e389670dadeff27cddca33c4cf0f"> Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts</a>.</p> <p>Annie has a very interesting background that makes her uniquely qualified to speak about high-level decision making. As an author, speaker, world-class poker player, and academic in the fields of psychology and cognitive theory, Annie understands the intersection of luck, skill, and making decisions in uncertain, chaotic environments better than most people on the planet.</p> <p>This is a whirlwind of an episode, and we cover all kinds of fascinating topics, including:</p> <ul> <li>The strange circumstances that shifted Annie’s path from finishing a Ph.D. in linguistics to becoming a professional poker player</li> <li>What it was like to be a female poker player in a predominantly male sport (especially before poker had become socially acceptable)</li> <li>What drew Annie into such a high stakes, time-pressured environment and why she felt like poker was the perfect fit for her</li> <li>How her graduate work in psychology informed the way she approached the game of poker — and helped her rack up wins</li> <li>How she finds the signal in a very noisy stream of feedback</li> <li>The big mistakes Annie noticed other players making that were stalling their progress in the game but allowed her to make giant leaps forward</li> <li>The role that mental models played in her learning process (and which models Annie liked to lean on the most in a high stakes game)</li> <li>The power of surrounding yourself with people that can help you expand your circle of competence — and how that made all the difference in Annie’s development as a player</li> <li>Confirmatory and exploratory thought, and how one helps us to be “accurate” and one helps us to be “right.”</li> <li>The secret pact you should be making with the people who are closest to you</li> </ul> <p>And so much more.</p> <p>This episode is just under two hours long, but there’s no fat in it. Annie delivers a masterclass in making the smartest decisions we can, even when our hubris insists otherwise. Do some finger stretches before hitting play, because you’re going to be taking some serious notes.</p> <p>Please enjoy the interview!</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Go Premium:</strong> Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

      <title>#36 William MacAskill: The Science of Doing Good</title>
      <description>On this episode of The Knowledge Project, I’m happy to have William MacAskill.
 William is the co-founder and President of the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) and an Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University. He is also the founder and president of 80,000 Hours, the co-founder and vice-president of Giving What We Can, and the author of Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference.
 William’s work is primarily focused on encouraging people to use reason and evidence to find the best possible ways they can use their resources to make the biggest possible impact in the world.
 We cover a lot of ground in this interview, including:
  Why good intentions aren’t enough when giving to charity and how we can do better
 How William's giving philosophy was formed and how it developed into The Centre for Effective Altruism
 The best metrics to assess how good a charity is before donating a dime
 How letting our emotions guide our charitable giving can lead to ineffective, and sometimes harmful outcomes.
 How many charities today unknowingly reward low dollar donors and sell themselves short millions of dollars in potential donations
 A powerful thought exercise to help you gain a different but valuable perspective about helping the poor and suffering in the world
 The one cognitive bias William believes is the most damaging to any business, organization or individual
 William’s foundational values that guide his day to day decisions and actions
 William’s take on “radical honesty” and when honesty can be taken too far and is no longer constructive
 William’s definition of success and the imaginary conversation he has with himself on his deathbed to make sure he’s on the right track (this is awesome)
 The most common mistake William sees people make over and over (and the embarrassingly simple way to avoid making it)
 And then to wrap up, I gave him a softball question: What is the purpose and meaning of life?
  If you’ve wanted to make more of a positive impact in the world around you, this insightful interview will give you plenty to think about. Your resources are precious and should be optimized to improve the lives of those you help. I don’t know of a better person to guide you than William.

      <title>#35 Robert Greene: Alive Time vs. Dead Time</title>
      <description>In this episode of The Knowledge Project, I have the brilliant Robert Greene. Robert is the
 author of 5 New York Times bestsellers, including The 48 Laws of Power and The 33 Strategies of War. He's also written on mastery and seduction.
 Robert’s books have been somewhat controversial over the years and have been called amoral, cunning, and even ruthless for what they reveal. Yet millions of readers, from mid-level managers to hip-hop royalty and corporate executives have revered his work as a sort of canonized scripture for the ambitious.
 In this conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including:
  Why Robert believes his first book, 48 Laws of Power has continued to sell steadily for over two decades.
 What Robert calls “alive time” and “dead time” and how we can optimize each day to be filled with “alive time” and live the life we’re proud of
 The one skill that determines how far you’ll get in life, no matter how talented you are in anything else
 Robert’s research method and how he finds such unique and interesting examples
 What Robert looks for when he reads, and what qualities separate good books from excellent books
 How Robert developed his famous note card system to extract the meat out of anything he reads
 Why Robert insists on writing all his notes longhand even though it’s less convenient and less accessible than taking notes digitally
 What Robert’s daily routine looks like, particularly when he’s writing and researching for a new book
 What Robert considers to be the single greatest power any human has, and what we can do to strengthen it
 How having unfettered access to information is actually making us dumber in very important ways and what we can do about it
 How to fine tune your “bullshit detector” so you’re able to tell the difference between pretenders and performers. (As a bonus, Robert shares a few ways you can improve your bullshitting skills when it becomes necessary)
  And a lot more.
 Plus, Robert gives us a sneak peek into his newest project,  The Laws of Human Nature, which explores the hidden motivations that drive what we do and say.
 This interview is packed to the brim with interesting and actionable insights that I think you’re going to love. Grab a pen, a notebook, and a glass of wine and enjoy!

      <title>#34 Amelia Boone: Learning How to Suffer</title>
      <description>Since the popularity of Obstacle Course Racing, or OCR, has exploded onto the scene, there has been one woman who has dominated the sport: Amelia Boone.
 Amelia ran her first race in 2011 after some prodding from a co-worker, and though she says she stumbled her way to an unimpressive finish, she was smitten. She has since amassed over  50 podiums and two dozen victories, including the Spartan Race World Championship in 2013, and the World's Toughest Mudder (three times!) in 2012, 2014 and 2015.
 Oh, and her 2014 victory came just eight weeks after major knee surgery.
 Though she vehemently denies it, Amelia is superhuman.
 This interview is a little different than others you may have heard on The Knowledge Project but no less fascinating.
 We cover a wide variety of topics including habits, reading, self-reliance, and training.
 Specifically, you’ll learn:
  Why Amelia was drawn to obstacle racing even though running was something she despised
 The complementary connection between her sport and her professional work and how racing has made her a more effective attorney
 How Amelia fights physical and mental fatigue when most people quit (she even shares a story of how she dealt with a vacant support station halfway through a 100 mile race)
 What she does to develop grit and resilience so she knows she can rely on herself when things get rough
 Amelia’s “to-do list” trick that makes sure she’s productive — you’ll want to steal this
 How a serious injury taught Amelia some of her most powerful lessons about who she is and what’s important to her
 What Amelia’s parents did to teach her to be self-sufficient from a very young age
 How she learned to deal with setbacks, and how careful she is with the language she uses when she speaks to herself when things go wrong
 Why Amelia runs with a Sharpie and the same playlist she’s listened to for the past 5 years
 How Amelia transformed herself from a casual weekend warrior to one of the most finely tuned athletes in the world
  Whether you’re an athlete, a weekend jogger, or the only exercise you get is the leisure stroll from the couch to the refrigerator, there are lots of insights and plenty of inspiration waiting for you in this interview.

She has since amassed over  50 podiums and two dozen victories, including the Spartan Race World Championship in 2013, and the World's Toughest Mudder (three times!) in 2012, 2014 and 2015.</p> <p>Oh, and her 2014 victory came just eight weeks after major knee surgery.</p> <p>Though she vehemently denies it, Amelia is superhuman.</p> <p>This interview is a little different than others you may have heard on The Knowledge Project but no less fascinating.</p> <p>We cover a wide variety of topics including habits, reading, self-reliance, and training.</p> <p>Specifically, you’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>Why Amelia was drawn to obstacle racing even though running was something she despised</li> <li>The complementary connection between her sport and her professional work and how racing has made her a more effective attorney</li> <li>How Amelia fights physical and mental fatigue when most people quit (she even shares a story of how she dealt with a vacant support station halfway through a 100 mile race)</li> <li>What she does to develop grit and resilience so she knows she can rely on herself when things get rough</li> <li>Amelia’s “to-do list” trick that makes sure she’s productive — you’ll want to steal this</li> <li>How a serious injury taught Amelia some of her most powerful lessons about who she is and what’s important to her</li> <li>What Amelia’s parents did to teach her to be self-sufficient from a very young age</li> <li>How she learned to deal with setbacks, and how careful she is with the language she uses when she speaks to herself when things go wrong</li> <li>Why Amelia runs with a Sharpie and the same playlist she’s listened to for the past 5 years</li> <li>How Amelia transformed herself from a casual weekend warrior to one of the most finely tuned athletes in the world</li> </ul> <p>Whether you’re an athlete, a weekend jogger, or the only exercise you get is the leisure stroll from the couch to the refrigerator, there are lots of insights and plenty of inspiration waiting for you in this interview.</p> <p><strong>Go Premium:</strong> Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

      <title>#33 Dan Ariely: The Truth About Lies</title>
      <description>On this episode of the Knowledge Project, I’m joined by the fascinating Dan Ariely. Dan just about does it all. He has delivered 6 TED talks with a combined 20 million views, he’s a multiple New York Times best-selling author, a widely published researcher, and the James B Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University.
 For the better part of three decades, Dan has been immersed in researching why humans do some of the silly, irrational things we do. And yes, as much as we’d all like to be exempt, that includes you too.
 In this captivating interview, we tackle a lot of interesting topics, including:
  The three types of decisions that control our life and how understanding our biases can help us make smarter decisions
 How our environment plays a big role in our decision making and the small changes we can make to automatically improve our outcomes
 The “behavioural driven” bathroom scale Dan has been working on to revolutionize weight loss
 Which of our irrational behaviors transfer across cultures and which ones are unique to certain parts of the world (for example, find out which country is the most honest)
 The dishonesty spectrum and why we as humans insist on flirting with the line between “honest” and “dishonest”
 3 sneaky mental tricks Dan uses to avoid making ego-driven decisions
 “Pluralistic ignorance” and how it dangerously affects our actions and inactions (As a bonus, Dan shares the hilarious way he demonstrates this concept to his students on their first day of class)
 The rule Dan created specifically for people with spinach in their teeth
 The difference between habits, rules, and rituals, and why they are critical to shaping us into who we want to be
  This was a riveting discussion and one that easily could have gone for hours. If you’ve ever wondered how you’d respond in any of these eye-opening experiments, you have to listen to this interview. If you’re anything like me, you’ll learn something new about yourself, whether you want to or not.

      <title>#32 Patrick Collison: Earning Your Stripes</title>
      <description>On this episode of the Knowledge Project Podcast, I chat with Patrick Collison, co-founder and CEO of the leading online payment processing company, Stripe. If you’ve purchased anything online recently, there’s a good chance that Stripe facilitated the transaction.
 What is now an organization with over a thousand employees and handling tens of billions of dollars of online purchases every year, began as a small side experiment while Patrick and his brother John were going to college.  
 During our conversation, Patrick shares the details of their unlikely journey and some of the hard-earned wisdom he picked up along the way. I hope you have something handy to write with because the nuggets per minute in this episode are off the charts. Patrick was so open and generous with his responses that I’m really excited for you to hear what he has to say.
 Here are just a few of the things we cover:
  The biggest (and most valuable) mistakes Patrick made in the early days of Stripe and how they helped him get better
 The characteristics that Patrick looks for in a new hire to fit and contribute to the Stripe company culture
 What compelled he and his brother to move forward with the early concept of Stripe, even though on paper it was doomed to fail from the start
 The gaps Patrick saw in the market that dozens of other processing companies were missing — and how he capitalized on them
 The lessons Patrick learned from scaling Stripe from two employees (he and his brother) to nearly 1,000 today
 How he evaluates the upsides and potential dangers of speculative positions within the company
 How his Irish upbringing influenced his ability to argue and disagree without taking offense (and how we can all be a little more “Irish”)
 The power of finding the right peer group in your social and professional circles and how impactful and influential it can be in determining where you end up.
 The 4 ways Patrick has modified his decision making process over the last 5 years and how it’s helped him develop as a person and as a business leader (this part alone is worth the listen)
 Patrick’s unique approach to books and how he chooses what he’s going to spend his time reading
  ...life in Silicon Valley, Baumol’s cost disease, and so, so much more.
 Patrick truly is one of the warmest, humblest and down-to-earth people I’ve had the pleasure to speak with and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation together. I hope you will too!

      <title>#31 Barbara Oakley: Learning How to Learn</title>
      <description>Just when I start to think I’m using my time well and getting a lot done in my life, I meet someone like Barbara Oakley.
 Barbara is a true polymath. She was a captain in the U.S. Army, a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers, a radio operator in the South Pole, an engineer, university professor, researcher and the author of 8 books.
 Oh, and she is also the creator and instructor of Learning to Learn, the most popular Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) ever(!), with over one million enrolled students.
 In this fascinating interview, we cover many aspects of learning, including how to make it stick so we remember more and forget less, how to be more efficient so we learn more quickly, and how to remove that barriers that get in the way of effective learning.
 Specifically, Barbara covers:
  How she changed her brain from hating math and science to loving it so much she now teaches engineering to college students
 What neuroscience can tell us about how to learn more effectively
 The two modes of your brain and how that impacts what and how you learn
 Why backing off can sometimes be the best thing you can do when learning something new
 How to “chunk” your learning so new knowledge is woven into prior knowledge making it easily accessible
 The best ways to develop new patterns of learning in our brains
 How to practice a skill so you can blast through plateaus and improve more quickly
 Her favorite tactic for dealing with procrastination so you can spend more time learning
 The activities she recommends that rapidly increase neural connections like fertilizer on the brain
 Whether memorization has a place in learning anymore, or simply a barrier to true understanding
 The truth about “learning types” and how identifying as a visual or auditory learner might be setting yourself up for failure.
  ...and a whole lot more.
 If you want to be the most efficient learner you can be, and have more fun doing it, you won’t want to miss this discussion.

      <title>#29 Dacher Keltner: Survival of the Kindest</title>
      <description>When Pixar was dreaming up the idea for Inside Out, a film that would explore the roiling emotions inside the head of a young girl, they needed guidance from an expert. So they called Dacher Keltner.
 Dacher is a psychologist at UC Berkeley who has dedicated his career to understanding how human emotion shapes the way we interact with the world, how we properly manage difficult or stressful situations, and ultimately, how we treat one another.
 In fact, he refers to emotions as the “language of social living.” The more fluent we are in this language, the happier and more meaningful our lives can be.
 We tackle a wide variety of topics in this conversation that I think you’ll really enjoy.
 You’ll learn:
  The three main drivers that determine your personal happiness and life satisfaction
 Simple things you can do everyday to jumpstart the “feel good” reward center of your brain
 The principle of “jen” and how we can use “high-jen behaviors” to bootstrap our own happiness
 How to have more positive influence in our homes, at work and in our communities.
 How to teach your kids to be more kind and empathetic in an increasingly self-centered world
 What you can do to stay grounded and humble if you are in a position of power or authority
 How to catch our own biases when we’re overly critical of another’s ideas (or overconfident in our own)
  And much more. We could have spent an hour discussing any one of these points alone, but there was so much I wanted to cover. I’m certain you’ll find this episode well worth your time.

      <title>#28 Michael Mauboussin: A Decision Making Jedi</title>
      <description>Michael Mauboussin returns for a fascinating encore interview on the Knowledge Project. We geek out on decision making, luck vs. skill, work life balance, and so much more.
 ***
 Michael Mauboussin is back as a returning guest on the Knowledge Project!
 He was actually the very first guest on the podcast when it was still very much an experiment. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to continue with the show. (If you missed his last interview, you can listen to it  here, or if you’re a member of The Learning Community, you can download a transcript.)
 Michael is one of my very favorite people to talk to, and I couldn’t wait to pick up right where we left off.
 In this interview, Michael and I dive deep into some of the topics we care most about here at Farnam Street, including:
  The concept of “base rates” and how they can help us make far better decisions and avoid the pain and consequences of making poor choices.
 How to know where you land on the luck/skill continuum and why it matters
 Michael’s advice on creating a systematic decision-making process in your organization to improve outcomes.
 The two most important elements of any decision-making process
 How to train your intuition to be one of your most powerful assets instead of a dangerous liability
 The three tests Michael uses in his company to determine the health and financial stability of his environment
 Why “algorithm aversion” is creating such headaches in many organizations and how to help your teams overcome it, so you can make more rapid progress
 The most impactful books that he’s read since we last spoke, is reading habits, and the strategies he uses to get the most of every book
 The importance of sleep in Michael's’ life to make sure his body and mind are running at peak efficiency
 His greatest failures and what he learned from them
 How Michael and his wife raised their kids and the unique parenting style they adopted
 How Michael defines happiness and the decisions he makes to maximize the joy in his life
  Any one of those insights alone is worth a listen, so I think you’re really going to enjoy this interview.

      <title>#26 Warren Berger: Improving The Questions You Ask</title>
      <description>The quality of your outcome depends on the quality of your questions. Through asking the right questions we can spark innovation and creativity, gain deeper knowledge in the topics that are most important to us, and propel us forward in our personal and professional pursuits.
 Yet very few of us do it well — if we do it at all.
 My guest on the podcast today is Warren Berger — journalist, speaker, best selling author, and self-proclaimed questionologist.
 His insightful book A More Beautiful Question shows how the world’s leading innovators, education leaders, creative thinkers, and red-hot start-ups ask game-changing questions to nurture creativity, solve problems, and create new possibilities.
 In this episode, we discuss the importance of asking the right questions, why they’re critical to your success, and how you may be one great question away from a major breakthrough.
 You’ll also learn:
  How Warren manages the constant input and stimulation from online consumption when it’s time to create.
 The small habits that pack the biggest punch and make the most difference in Warren’s life
 What makes a question more or less effective
 How to create a culture where questions are welcome and encouraged
 Why answering all your kids’ questions may be doing them a disservice — and what to do instead
 What “collaborative inquiry” is and how to use it to get the most out of your teams in the workplace
 How Warren transformed one of his most painful failures into one of his most proud achievements
 Why Warren insists that everyone is creative, and what we can do to fan the flames of our own creativity
  If you think you could improve the quality (and frequency) of your questions to enhance key areas of your life, this is not a conversation you’ll want to miss.

      <title>#25 Gary Taubes: Is Sugar Slowly Killing Us</title>
      <description>It seems that nowadays, aside from religion and politics, one of the most hotly debated topics is that of nutrition.
 Should we eat high carb diets? Low carb? High fat? High protein? What about wheat or gluten? Should we eat meat or adopt a vegan diet?
 There are as many opinions as there are people — and books, magazines and websites are overflowing with information showing you the “right” way to eat and exercise to lose weight.
 But if “eating less and moving more” is all it takes to lose weight and enjoy a healthy lifestyle, why are so many of us fat and getting fatter?
 In this episode, I chat with Gary Taubes, bestselling author of three books, The Case Against Sugar (2016), Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It (2011) and Good Calories, Bad Calories (2007).
 We talk about the sharp rise of obesity and diabetes in America, the structural hurdles to effective nutrition research, and explore the common myth that a calorie is just a calorie.
 Here are a few other things you’ll learn in this interview:
  How diets shifted in the last century, and what impact it’s having on our bodies today.
 Why a carb isn’t just a carb — and why you should know the difference
 Is the sugar industry the new Big Tobacco?
 What role genetics play in our health, and how much is under our control
 Why humans are so attracted to sugar and how to break the habit
 Gary’s suggestions to improve your health, drop body fat and feel terrific
 The benefits of fasting and how you can try it out yourself
  And a bunch more.
 If you think at all about your health, give this podcast a listen.

      <title>#24 Susan Cain: Leading the Quiet Revolution</title>
      <description>For decades, introversion was looked at as something to overcome, almost like an illness. The way to win in life was through charisma, outspokenness, and self-promotion.
 Even now, in an increasingly noisy world, introverts may feel added pressure to take one of two paths: force themselves into more extroverted behavior, or become even more reserved and shrink back to themselves.
 My guest Susan Cain says both paths are wrong and in fact, rob the world of the unique contributions introverts make when they choose to be true to themselves.
 Susan knows what she’s talking about. A self-proclaimed introvert, she wrote the New York Times bestselling book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking and delivered one of the most popular TED talks ever delivered, with nearly 18 million views to date.
 Whether you consider yourself an extrovert, an introvert, or an ambivert (those lucky bastards in the middle) you’ll find a ton of value in this interview.

      <title>#22 Adam Grant: Givers, Takers, and the Resilient Mind</title>
      <description>Are you a giver or a taker? Have you ever struggled to find work/life balance? How do you build resilience in yourself, your team, or your children?
 I tackle these topics and many more in this interview with my special guest, Adam Grant.
 In this interview, we cover a lot, including:
  How to tell if you are a giver or a taker (Spoiler: if you just told yourself you’re a giver, you might be in for a rude awakening)
 How Adam filters down hundreds of ideas and opportunities to the select few he focuses on
 How to tell if your business idea is a winner or a huge waste of time
 Why “quick to start and slow to finish” is great advice for budding entrepreneurs
 How to nurture creativity and resilience in your children (or team culture)
 How to create positive competitive environments that bring out the best in people
 Adam’s two core family values and how he instills them in his children
 “Mental time travel” and how it can make you resilient to any challenge or obstacle
 Why “how can I be more productive” is the wrong question to ask (and what to ask instead)
 How Adam and I each address the topic of work/life balance
  And so much more.

      <title>#21 Ed Latimore: The Warrior Poet</title>
      <description>Ed Latimore might be the most interesting person you'll ever meet.
 Ed is a professional heavyweight boxer, physics major, and philosopher. He's also the author of the cult-hit Not Caring What Other People Think Is a Superpower. If there's anything Ed feels like doing, he simply does it.
 This interview explores the physics of boxing, the value of a coach, and much of Ed’s hard-fought wisdom. You’ll discover:
  How the painful end to a relationship lit a fire under Ed that hasn’t stopped burning
 How Ed knows when he’s bitten off more than he can chew and needs to ease up on the accelerator
 Why motivation is a terrible way to achieve great things (and what to do instead)
 The unlikely way that Ed’s runaway best selling book came about
 Why Ed thinks every person should step into the boxing ring at least once in their life
 How people get stuck on the “dopamine treadmill” which feels productive but actually gets you nowhere (this is the kiss of death if you want to accomplish any important goal)
 Ed’s brilliant philosophy on pain and suffering that will change the way you view hardships in your life
 Ed’s somewhat controversial approach to coaching children and getting the very best out of them
 The most important element of creating a positive habit (most people get this wrong)
  And more.
 After listening to this warrior poet, you won’t look at life the same again.

      <title>#20 Marc Garneau: The Future of Transportation</title>
      <description>Marc Garneau is a Canadian politician, Engineer, and the Minister of Transport. This interview was recorded live in front of an audience in Montreal. As a bilingual country, you'll hear bits of French from the audience questions here and there but the interview is predominately in English.
 In this interview, we discuss the future of transportation (including self-driving cars), infrastructure investments, space, what it means to be a liberal in 2017, how we — as citizens — can judge an elected politician, how he ensures he's getting accurate information in a political system and so much more. 
 Enjoy this amazing conversation.

      <title>Rory Sutherland: The Psychology of Advertising</title>
      <description>Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, reveals how human psychology shapes everything from marketing to monarchy. Through stories about airport security, tribal politics, and the paradox of choice, he explains why rational solutions often fail and psychological insights succeed. A masterclass in understanding what drives human behavior and why the most effective answers aren't always the most logical.

      <title>#18 Naval Ravikant: The Angel Philosopher</title>
      <description>Naval Ravikant is the CEO and co-founder of AngelList. He’s invested in more than 100 companies, including Uber, Twitter, Yammer, and many others.
 It’s difficult to nail down exactly what we discuss in our conversation because I had so many questions to ask him. Naval is an incredibly deep thinker who challenges the status quo on so many things. This is an interview you’ll want to listen to, think a bit, and then listen to again.
 Here are just a few of the many things we cover in this episode:
  What a “typical day” looks like (not the answer I expected, and not one you’ve likely heard before)
 How Naval developed his legendary reading habits and how he finds time to read no matter how busy life gets
 How the internet has impacted book reading (both good and bad) and how to make sure you’re getting the best information from the most reliable sources
 What popular habit advice Naval thinks is BS and why
 Naval’s habit stacking technique that helped him overcome a desire for alcohol and other potentially destructive habits
 How Naval’s core values give direction to his life and how those values developed over time
 Naval’s thoughts on the current education system and what we can do to facilitate better learning for our children
 Naval’s favorite mental models for making critical high-stakes decisions
 His brilliant two-factor calendar authentication concept to keep him focused on only the most important projects
 Naval’s definition for the meaning of life (buckle up for this one)
 His amazing response to the investor who wanted to be just like Steve Jobs
  And so, so much more.
 Just a heads up, this is the longest podcast I’ve ever done. While it felt like only thirty minutes, our conversation lasted over two hours!
 And although it is the longest, it’s also our most downloaded episode on the Knowledge Project, so make sure you have a pen and paper handy. There’s a lot of wisdom up for grabs here.
 Enjoy this amazing conversation.

      <title>Aristotle Koskinas on Greek History</title>
      <description>This is one of 2 interviews that I conducted while visiting Greece this summer. Greek history is deep routed in many things as philosophy, democracy and culture and has laid the foundation of so much of what we know and how we live today. Today I speak with Aristotle Koskinas (@aristotlekoskin), a guide with Athens walking tours. He's one of the best guides you can find in Athens. In order to be a guide in Greece, an individual must complete a 2½ year program at the School of Tourist Guides in Greece - which is a state school under the Ministry of Development. Some of the courses in the curriculum include Ancient Greek history, Byzantine history, Prehistoric Archaeology, Mythology, Geology, history of Theater –and psychology of the tourist. Listen in for details on the history of Athens over the past 3000 years, the influence Greek culture has had across the world, and some insight on what surprises him meeting visitors from different countries.

Today I speak with Aristotle Koskinas (<a href="https://twitter.com/aristotlekoskin">@aristotlekoskin</a>), a guide with <a href="http://www.athenswalkingtours.gr/">Athens walking tours</a>. He's one of the best guides you can find in Athens. In order to be a guide in Greece, an individual must complete a 2½ year program at the School of Tourist Guides in Greece - which is a state school under the Ministry of Development. Some of the courses in the curriculum include Ancient Greek history, Byzantine history, Prehistoric Archaeology, Mythology, Geology, history of Theater –and psychology of the tourist. Listen in for details on the history of Athens over the past 3000 years, the influence Greek culture has had across the world, and some insight on what surprises him meeting visitors from different countries.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Go Premium:</strong> Members get early access, ad-free episodes, hand-edited transcripts, searchable transcripts, member-only episodes, and more.

      <title>Santorini Wine with Panayiota Kalogeropoulou</title>
      <description>The island of Santorini has not only has breathtaking views but also a fascinating history. Traces of its first inhabitants have been linked back to 4500 BC. In 1613 BC the most powerful volcanic event in the last 10,000 years took place – completely destroying all the islands within a 60 km radius. It has been estimated that 90 billion tons of molten rock was injected into the air, the sea swallowed the volcano, and a massive tsunami swept across the Aegean Sea. Along with the obvious devastation of nature, it is believed that the eruption also sealed the deal for the most civilized nation on the island at the time, the Minoans. Thanks to the thick layer of ash cause by the event, the Bronze Age settlement of Akrotiri was so well preserved that we are able to see how prosperous the area had once been with an elaborate drainage systems, multi-storied buildings, incredible wall paintings, furniture and vessels. The site has as much of a significant importance as does Pompeii. The island’s main volcanic rock, its mineral rich soil, and the amazing climate, has produced some incredibly unique wines. Santorini is known for some of the oldest vineyards in the world. And we know that wine is one of my favourite topics. On today’s podcast I speak with Panayiota Kalogeropoulou about Santorini’s wines. Panayiota is the Director at the Domaine Sigalas vineyard. Paris Sigalas, a mathematician with a goal to make his Santorini vineyard a world heritage site, focuses on grapes that thrive in Santorini (these include the Aidani, Athiri, Plantana – and the prime Greek grape Assyrtiko).
