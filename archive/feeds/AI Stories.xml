We then dig into his PhD before focusing on his research at FAIR where Samuel works on imitation learning from images. We finally explore the main challenges behind AI and Ethics, a field that he is particularly interested in. We discuss various topics including what a biased dataset actually means, regulations in the field and potential solutions to shape a future of ethical AI. <br/><br/>Throughout our conversation, Samuel also gives various advice on succeeding in academia and choosing the right career path. </p>]]></description>

Youri talks about how he managed the development of AI and OR algorithms to help businesses like DFS or Tesco save millions of pounds. He also gives advice on how to grow and quickly progress inside a company. <br/>We finally dig into the world of AI startups. Youri explains why he created Prediko and how he uses machine learning to help small and medium e-commerce brands better plan their inventory. We talk about the difficulties behind building a startup and discuss the tradeoff between deep learning and more traditional algorithms for business applications. <br/>Throughout the conversation, Youri also shares various advice on how to advance in your career, how to become a good Data Scientist and how to build your own AI startup.  </p>]]></description>
