<p>In this episode of Data Science at Home, we explore the fascinating world of neuromorphic computing — a brain-inspired approach to computation that could reshape the future of AI and robotics. The episode breaks down how neuromorphic systems differ from conventional AI architectures like transformers and LLMs, diving into spiking neural networks (SNNs), their benefits in energy efficiency and real-time processing, and their limitations in training and scalability. Real-world applications are highlighted, including low-power drones, hearing aids, and event-based cameras. Francesco closes with a vision of hybrid systems where neuromorphic chips and LLMs coexist, blending biological inspiration with modern AI.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this gripping follow-up, we dive into how AI is transforming kinetic operations—from identifying a threat to executing a strike.
🔍 Highlights from this episode:


How AI compresses the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)


The spectrum of autonomy: human-on-the-loop vs. human-out-of-the-loop


Real-world systems like loitering munitions (Switchblade, Harpy) and Selective Ground Response AI (SGR-AI)


The ethical and legal dimensions of delegating lethal decisions to machines


 
As the lines blur between algorithm and operator, we explore who—or what—is pulling the trigger.

Today, we’re dissecting Sam Altman’s “AI manifesto”—a magical journey where, apparently, AI will fix everything from climate change to your grandma's back pain. Superintelligence is “just a few thousand days away,” right? Sure, Sam, and my cat’s about to become a calculus tutor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this episode, I’ll break down the bold (and often bizarre) claims in Altman’s grand speech for the Intelligence Age. I’ll give you the real scoop on what’s realistic, what’s nonsense, and why some tech billionaires just can’t resist overselling. Think AI’s all-knowing, all-powerful future is just around the corner?

<p>In this episode of Data Science at Home, we confront a tragic story highlighting the ethical and emotional complexities of AI technology. A U.S. teenager recently took his own life after developing a deep emotional attachment to an AI chatbot emulating a character from Game of Thrones. This devastating event has sparked urgent discussions on the mental health risks, ethical responsibilities, and potential regulations surrounding AI chatbots, especially as they become increasingly lifelike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>🎙️ Topics Covered: </p>
<p>AI &amp; Emotional Attachment: How hyper-realistic AI chatbots can foster intense emotional bonds with users, especially vulnerable groups like adolescents.</p>
<p>Mental Health Risks: The potential for AI to unintentionally contribute to mental health issues, and the challenges of diagnosing such impacts. Ethical &amp; Legal Accountability: How companies like Character AI are being held accountable and the ethical questions raised by emotionally persuasive AI.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>🚨 Analogies Explored: </p>
<p>From VR to CGI and deepfakes, we discuss how hyper-realism in AI parallels other immersive technologies and why its emotional impact can be particularly disorienting and even harmful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>🛠️ Possible Mitigations: </p>
<p>We cover potential solutions like age verification, content monitoring, transparency in AI design, and ethical audits that could mitigate some of the risks involved with hyper-realistic AI interactions. 👀 Key Takeaways: As AI becomes more realistic, it brings both immense potential and serious responsibility. Join us as we dive into the ethical landscape of AI—analyzing how we can ensure this technology enriches human lives without crossing lines that could harm us emotionally and psychologically.

In this episode of Data Science at Home, Frag dives deep into the wild claims that Large Language Models (LLMs) like Chinchilla 70B are beating traditional lossless compression algorithms. 🧠💥</p>
<p>But before you toss out your FLAC collection, let's break down Shannon's Source Coding Theorem and why entropy sets the ultimate limit on lossless compression.</p>
<p>We explore: ⚙️ How LLMs leverage probabilistic patterns for compression 📉 Why compression efficiency doesn’t equal general intelligence 🚀 The practical (and ridiculous) challenges of using AI for compression 💡 Can AI actually BREAK Shannon’s limit—or is it just an illusion? </p>

<p>In this episode, we dive into the fascinating world of zero-knowledge proofs and their impact on data science. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that they know a secret without revealing the secret itself. This powerful concept has numerous applications in data science, from ensuring data privacy and security, to facilitating secure transactions and identity verification. We explore the mechanics of zero-knowledge proofs, its real-world applications, and how it is revolutionizing the way we handle sensitive information. 
Join us as we uncover the secrets of zero-knowledge proofs and its impact on the future of data science.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes applications crash. Some other times applications crash because memory is exhausted. Such issues exist because of bugs in the code, or heavy memory usage for reasons that were not expected during design and implementation. 
Can we use machine learning to predict and eventually detect out of memory kills from the operating system?</p>
<p>Apparently, the Netflix app many of us use on a daily basis leverage ML and time series analysis to prevent OOM-kills.</p>

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,034
And here we are again with the season four of the Data Science at Home podcast.</p>
<p>2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:19,170
This time we have something for you if you want to help us shape the data science leaders of the future, we have created the the Data Science at Home's Ambassador program.</p>
<p>3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:28,378
Ambassadors are volunteers who are passionate about data science and want to give back to our growing community of data science professionals and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>4
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:37,558
You will be instrumental in helping us achieve our goal of raising awareness about the critical role of data science in cutting edge technologies.</p>
<p>5
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:45,740

<p>6
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,234
Welcome back to another episode of Data Science at Home podcast.</p>
<p>7
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:55,426
I'm Francesco Podcasting from the Regular Office of Amethyx Technologies, based in Belgium.</p>
<p>8
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:02,914
In this episode, I want to speak about a machine learning problem that has been formulated at Netflix.</p>
<p>9
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:22,038
And for the record, Netflix is not sponsoring this episode, though I still believe that this problem is a very well known problem, a very common one across factors, which is how to predict out of memory kill in an application and formulate this problem as a machine learning problem.</p>
<p>10
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:39,142
So this is something that, as I said, is very interesting, not just because of Netflix, but because it allows me to explain a few points that, as I said, are kind of invariance across sectors.</p>
<p>11
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:56,218
Regardless of your application, is a video streaming application or any other communication type of application, or a fintech application, or energy, or whatever, this memory kill, out of memory kill still occurs.</p>
<p>12
00:01:56,314 --> 00:02:05,622
And what is an out of memory kill? Well, it's essentially the extreme event in which the machine doesn't have any more memory left.</p>
<p>13
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:16,678
And so usually the operating system can start eventually swapping, which means using the SSD or the hard drive as a source of memory.</p>
<p>14
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,100
But that, of course, will slow down a lot.</p>
<p>15
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:45,210
And eventually when there is a bug or a memory leak, or if there are other applications running on the same machine, of course there is some kind of limiting factor that essentially kills the application, something that occurs from the operating system most of the time that kills the application in order to prevent the application from monopolizing the entire machine, the hardware of the machine.</p>
<p>16
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,500
And so this is a very important problem.</p>
<p>17
00:02:49,070 --> 00:03:03,306
Also, it is important to have an episode about this because there are some strategies that I've used at Netflix that are pretty much in line with what I believe machine learning should be about.</p>
<p>18
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:25,062
And usually people would go for the fancy solution there like this extremely accurate predictors or machine learning models, but you should have a massive number of parameters and that try to figure out whatever is happening on that machine that is running that application.</p>
<p>19
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:29,466
While the solution at Netflix is pretty straightforward, it's pretty simple.</p>
<p>20
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:33,654
And so one would say then why making an episode after this? Well.</p>
<p>21
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:45,730
Because I think that we need more sobriety when it comes to machine learning and I believe we still need to spend a lot of time thinking about what data to collect.</p>
<p>22
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:59,730
Reasoning about what is the problem at hand and what is the data that can actually tickle the particular machine learning model and then of course move to the actual prediction that is the actual model.</p>
<p>23
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:15,910
That most of the time it doesn't need to be one of these super fancy things that you see on the news around chatbots or autonomous gaming agent or drivers and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>24
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:28,518
So there are essentially two data sets that the people at Netflix focus on which are consistently different, dramatically different in fact.</p>
<p>25
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:45,570
These are data about device characteristics and capabilities and of course data that are collected at Runtime and that give you a picture of what's going on in the memory of the device, right? So that's the so called runtime memory data and out of memory kills.</p>
<p>26
00:04:45,950 --> 00:05:03,562
So the first type of data is I would consider it very static because it considers for example, the device type ID, the version of the software development kit that application is running, cache capacities, buffer capacities and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>27
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:11,190
So it's something that most of the time doesn't change across sessions and so that's why it's considered static.</p>
<p>28
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,430
In contrast, the other type of data, the Runtime memory data, as the name says it's runtime.</p>
<p>29
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,190
So it varies across the life of the session it's collected at Runtime.</p>
<p>30
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,938
So it's very dynamic data.</p>
<p>31
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:36,298
And example of these records are for example, profile, movie details, playback information, current memory usage, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>32
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:56,086
So this is the data that actually moves and moves in the sense that it changes depending on how the user is actually using the Netflix application, what movie or what profile description, what movie detail has been loaded for that particular movie and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>33
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:15,094
So one thing that of course the first difficulty of the first challenge that the people at Netflix had to deal with was how would you combine these two things, very static and usually small tables versus very dynamic and usually large tables or views.</p>
<p>34
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:36,702
Well, there is some sort of join on key that is performed by the people at Netflix in order to put together these different data resolutions, right, which is data of the same phenomenon but from different sources and with different carrying very different signals in there.</p>
<p>35
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:48,620
So the device capabilities is captured usually by the static data and of course the other data, the Runtime memory and out of memory kill data.</p>
<p>36
00:06:48,950 --> 00:07:04,162
These are also, as I said, the data that will describe pretty accurately how is the user using that particular application on that particular hardware.</p>
<p>37
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:17,566
Now of course, when it comes to data and deer, there is nothing new that people at Netflix have introduced dealing with missing data for example, or incorporating knowledge of devices.</p>
<p>38
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:26,062
It's all stuff that it's part of the so called data cleaning and data collection strategy, right? Or data preparation.</p>
<p>39
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:40,782
That is, whatever you're going to do in order to make that data or a combination of these data sources, let's say, compatible with the way your machine learning model will understand or will read that data.</p>
<p>40
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:58,638
So if you think of a big data platform, the first step, the first challenge you have to deal, you have to deal with is how can I, first of all, collect the right amount of information, the right data, but also how to transform this data for my particular big data platform.</p>
<p>41
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:12,798
And that's something that, again, nothing new, nothing fancy, just basics, what we have been used to, what we are used to seeing now for the last decade or more, that's exactly what they do.</p>
<p>42
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:15,222
And now let me tell you something important.</p>
<p>43
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,278
Cybercriminals are evolving.</p>
<p>44
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:22,446
Their techniques and tactics are more advanced, intricate and dangerous than ever before.</p>
<p>45
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:30,630
Industries and governments around the world are fighting back on dealing new regulations meant to better protect data against this rising threat.</p>
<p>46
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:39,262
Today, the world of cybersecurity compliance is a complex one, and understanding the requirements your organization must adhere to can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>47
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:42,178
But not when the pack has your best architect.</p>
<p>48
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:53,840
Wolf, the leader in security operations, is on a mission to end cyber risk by giving organizations the protection, information and confidence they need to protect their people, technology and data.</p>

That's arcticwolf.com DataScience.</p>
<p>52
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,378
I think that the most important part, though, I think are actually equally important.</p>
<p>53
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:26,854
But the way they treat runtime memory data and out of memory kill data is by using sliding windows.</p>
<p>54
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:38,718
So that's something that is really worth mentioning, because the way you would frame this problem is something is happening at some point in time and I have to kind of predict that event.</p>
<p>55
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:49,326
That is usually an outlier in the sense that these events are quite rare, fortunately, because Netflix would not be as usable as we believe it is.</p>
<p>56
00:09:49,448 --> 00:10:04,110
So you would like to predict these weird events by looking at a historical view or an historical amount of records that you have before this particular event, which is the kill of the application.</p>
<p>57
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,870
So the concept of the sliding window, the sliding window approach is something that comes as the most natural thing anyone would do.</p>
<p>58
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,366
And that's exactly what the researchers and Netflix have done.</p>
<p>59
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:25,494
So unexpectedly, in my opinion, they treated this problem as a time series, which is exactly what it is.</p>
<p>60
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:26,190
Now.</p>
<p>61
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,754
They.</p>
<p>62
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:27,330
Of course.</p>
<p>63
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,426
Use this sliding window with a different horizon.</p>
<p>64
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:32,190
Five minutes.</p>
<p>65
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,838
Four minutes.</p>
<p>66
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,702
Two minutes.</p>
<p>67
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,366
As close as possible to the event.</p>
<p>68
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,886
Because maybe there are some.</p>
<p>69
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:39,762
Let's say.</p>
<p>70
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:45,678
Other dynamics that can raise when you are very close to the event or when you are very far from it.</p>
<p>71
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:50,166
Like five minutes far from the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>72
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:51,858
Might have some other.</p>
<p>73
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:52,410
Let's say.</p>
<p>74
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,986
Diagrams or shapes in the data.</p>
<p>75
00:10:56,168 --> 00:11:11,310
So for example, you might have a certain number of allocations that keep growing and growing, but eventually they grow with a certain curve or a certain rate that you can measure when you are five to ten minutes far from the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>76
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,566
When you are two minutes far from the out of memory kill, probably this trend will change.</p>
<p>77
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:30,800
And so probably what you would expect is that the memory is already half or more saturated and therefore, for example, the operating system starts swapping or other things are happening that you are going to measure in this.</p>
<p>78
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:39,730
And that would give you a much better picture of what's going on in the, let's say, closest neighborhood of that event, the time window.</p>
<p>79
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:51,042
The sliding window and time window approach is definitely worth mentioning because this is something that you can apply if you think pretty much anywhere right now.</p>
<p>80
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,050
What they did.</p>
<p>81
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:04,146
In addition to having a time window, a sliding window, they also assign different levels to memory readings that are closer to the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>82
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:10,062
And usually these levels are higher and higher as we get closer and closer to the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>83
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:15,402
So this means that, for example, we would have, for a five minute window, we would have a level one.</p>
<p>84
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:22,230
Five minute means five minutes far from the out of memory kill, four minutes would be a level two.</p>
<p>85
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:37,234
Three minutes it's much closer would be a level three, two minutes would be a level four, which means like kind of the severity of the event as we get closer and closer to the actual event when the application is actually killed.</p>
<p>86
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:51,474
So by looking at this approach, nothing new there, even, I would say not even a seasoned data scientist would have understood that using a sliding window is the way to go.</p>
<p>87
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:55,482
I'm not saying that Netflix engineers are not seasoned enough.</p>
<p>88
00:12:55,556 --> 00:13:04,350
Actually they do a great job every day to keep giving us video streaming platforms that actually never fail or almost never fail.</p>
<p>89
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,460
So spot on there, guys, good job.</p>
<p>90
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:27,738
But looking at this sliding window approach, the direct consequence of this is that they can plot, they can do some sort of graphical analysis of the out of memory kills versus the memory usage that can give the reader or the data scientist a very nice picture of what's going on there.</p>
<p>91
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:39,330
And so you would have, for example, and I would definitely report some of the pictures, some of the diagrams and graphs in the show notes of this episode on the official website datascienceaton.com.</p>
<p>92
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:48,238
But essentially what you can see there is that there might be premature peaks at, let's say, a lower memory reading.</p>
<p>93
00:13:48,334 --> 00:14:08,958
And usually these are some kind of false positives or anomalies that should not be there, then it's possible to set a threshold where the threshold to start lowering the memory usage because after that threshold something nasty can happen and usually happens according to your data.</p>
<p>94
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:18,740
And then of course there is another graph about the Gaussian distribution or in fact no sharp peak at all.</p>
<p>95
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,898
That is like kills or out of memory.</p>
<p>96
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:33,754
Kills are more or less distributed in a normalized fashion and then of course there are the genuine peaks that indicate that kills near, let's say, the threshold.</p>
<p>97
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:38,758
And so usually you would see that after that particular threshold of memory usage.</p>
<p>98
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:42,142
You see most of the out of memory kills.</p>
<p>99
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:45,570
Which makes sense because given a particular device.</p>
<p>100
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,298
Which means certain amount of memories.</p>
<p>101
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,338
Certain memory characteristics.</p>
<p>102
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:53,074
Certain version of the SDK and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>103
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:53,814
You can say.</p>
<p>104
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,090
Okay.</p>
<p>105
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:10,510
Well for this device type I have this memory memory usage threshold and after this I see that I have a relatively high number of out of memory kills immediately after this threshold.</p>
<p>106
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:18,150
And this means that probably that is the threshold you would like to consider as the critical threshold you should never or almost never cross.</p>
<p>107
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:38,758
So once you have this picture in front of you, you can start thinking of implementing some mechanisms that can monitor the memory usage and of course kind of preemptively dialocate things or keep that memory threshold as low as possible with respect to the critical threshold.</p>
<p>108
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:53,446
So you can start implementing some logic that prevents the application from being killed by the operating system so that you would in fact reduce the rate of out of memory kills overall.</p>
<p>109
00:15:53,578 --> 00:16:11,410
Now, as always and as also the engineers state in their blog post, in the technical post, they say well, it's much more important for us to predict with a certain amount of false positive rather than false negatives.</p>
<p>110
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,718
False negatives means missing an out of memory kill that actually occurred but got not predicted.</p>
<p>111
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:40,462
If you are a regular listener of this podcast, that statement should resonate with you because this is exactly what happens, for example in healthcare applications, which means that doctors or algorithms that operate in healthcare would definitely prefer to have a bit more false positives rather than more false negatives.</p>
<p>112
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:54,800
Because missing that someone is sick means that you are not providing a cure and you're just sending the patient home when he or she is sick, right? That's the false positive, it's the mess.</p>
<p>113
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,618
So that's a false negative, it's the mess.</p>
<p>114
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:09,486
But having a false positive, what can go wrong with having a false positive? Well, probably you will undergo another test to make sure that the first test is confirmed or not.</p>
<p>115
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:16,018
So adding a false positive in this case is relatively okay with respect to having a false negative.</p>
<p>116
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:19,398
And that's exactly what happens to the Netflix application.</p>
<p>117
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:32,094
Now, I don't want to say that of course Netflix application is as critical as, for example, the application that predicts a cancer or an xray or something on an xray or disorder or disease of some sort.</p>
<p>118
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:48,090
But what I'm saying is that there are some analogies when it comes to machine learning and artificial intelligence and especially data science, the old school data science, there are several things that kind of are, let's say, invariant across sectors.</p>
<p>119
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:56,826
And so, you know, two worlds like the media streaming or video streaming and healthcare are of course very different from each other.</p>
<p>120
00:17:56,888 --> 00:18:05,274
But when it comes to machine learning and data science applications, well, there are a lot of analogies there.</p>
<p>121
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:06,202
And indeed.</p>
<p>122
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:10,234
In terms of the models that they use at Netflix to predict.</p>
<p>123
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:24,322
Once they have the sliding window data and essentially they have the ground truth of where this out of memory kill happened and what happened before to the memory of the application or the machine.</p>
<p>124
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:24,774
Well.</p>
<p>125
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:30,514
Then the models they use to predict these things is these events is Artificial Neural Networks.</p>
<p>126
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:31,714
Xg Boost.</p>
<p>127
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:36,742
Ada Boost or Adaptive Boosting Elastic Net with Softmax and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>128
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,226
So nothing fancy.</p>
<p>129
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:45,046
As you can see, Xg Boost is probably one of the most used I would have expected even random forest.</p>
<p>130
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:47,120
Probably they do, they've tried that.</p>
<p>131
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:58,842
But XGBoost is probably one of the most used models on kaggle competitions for a reason, because it works and it leverages a lot.</p>
<p>132
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:04,880
The data preparation step, that solves already more than half of the problem.</p>
<p>133
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,270

00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,234<br>
Welcome back to another episode of Data Science at Home podcast.</p>
<p>7<br>
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:55,426<br>
I'm Francesco Podcasting from the Regular Office of Amethyx Technologies, based in Belgium.</p>
<p>8<br>
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:02,914<br>
In this episode, I want to speak about a machine learning problem that has been formulated at Netflix.</p>
<p>9<br>
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:22,038<br>
And for the record, Netflix is not sponsoring this episode, though I still believe that this problem is a very well known problem, a very common one across factors, which is how to predict out of memory kill in an application and formulate this problem as a machine learning problem.</p>
<p>10<br>
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:39,142<br>
So this is something that, as I said, is very interesting, not just because of Netflix, but because it allows me to explain a few points that, as I said, are kind of invariance across sectors.</p>
<p>11<br>
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:56,218<br>
Regardless of your application, is a video streaming application or any other communication type of application, or a fintech application, or energy, or whatever, this memory kill, out of memory kill still occurs.</p>
<p>12<br>
00:01:56,314 --> 00:02:05,622<br>
And what is an out of memory kill? Well, it's essentially the extreme event in which the machine doesn't have any more memory left.</p>
<p>13<br>
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:16,678<br>
And so usually the operating system can start eventually swapping, which means using the SSD or the hard drive as a source of memory.</p>
<p>14<br>
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,100<br>
But that, of course, will slow down a lot.</p>
<p>15<br>
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:45,210<br>
And eventually when there is a bug or a memory leak, or if there are other applications running on the same machine, of course there is some kind of limiting factor that essentially kills the application, something that occurs from the operating system most of the time that kills the application in order to prevent the application from monopolizing the entire machine, the hardware of the machine.</p>
<p>16<br>
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,500<br>
And so this is a very important problem.</p>
<p>17<br>
00:02:49,070 --> 00:03:03,306<br>
Also, it is important to have an episode about this because there are some strategies that I've used at Netflix that are pretty much in line with what I believe machine learning should be about.</p>
<p>18<br>
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:25,062<br>
And usually people would go for the fancy solution there like this extremely accurate predictors or machine learning models, but you should have a massive number of parameters and that try to figure out whatever is happening on that machine that is running that application.</p>
<p>19<br>
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:29,466<br>
While the solution at Netflix is pretty straightforward, it's pretty simple.</p>
<p>20<br>
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:33,654<br>
And so one would say then why making an episode after this? Well.</p>
<p>21<br>
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:45,730<br>
Because I think that we need more sobriety when it comes to machine learning and I believe we still need to spend a lot of time thinking about what data to collect.</p>
<p>22<br>
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:59,730<br>
Reasoning about what is the problem at hand and what is the data that can actually tickle the particular machine learning model and then of course move to the actual prediction that is the actual model.</p>
<p>23<br>
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:15,910<br>
That most of the time it doesn't need to be one of these super fancy things that you see on the news around chatbots or autonomous gaming agent or drivers and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>24<br>
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:28,518<br>
So there are essentially two data sets that the people at Netflix focus on which are consistently different, dramatically different in fact.</p>
<p>25<br>
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:45,570<br>
These are data about device characteristics and capabilities and of course data that are collected at Runtime and that give you a picture of what's going on in the memory of the device, right? So that's the so called runtime memory data and out of memory kills.</p>
<p>26<br>
00:04:45,950 --> 00:05:03,562<br>
So the first type of data is I would consider it very static because it considers for example, the device type ID, the version of the software development kit that application is running, cache capacities, buffer capacities and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>27<br>
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:11,190<br>
So it's something that most of the time doesn't change across sessions and so that's why it's considered static.</p>
<p>28<br>
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,430<br>
In contrast, the other type of data, the Runtime memory data, as the name says it's runtime.</p>
<p>29<br>
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,190<br>
So it varies across the life of the session it's collected at Runtime.</p>
<p>30<br>
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,938<br>
So it's very dynamic data.</p>
<p>31<br>
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:36,298<br>
And example of these records are for example, profile, movie details, playback information, current memory usage, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>32<br>
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:56,086<br>
So this is the data that actually moves and moves in the sense that it changes depending on how the user is actually using the Netflix application, what movie or what profile description, what movie detail has been loaded for that particular movie and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>33<br>
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:15,094<br>
So one thing that of course the first difficulty of the first challenge that the people at Netflix had to deal with was how would you combine these two things, very static and usually small tables versus very dynamic and usually large tables or views.</p>
<p>34<br>
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:36,702<br>
Well, there is some sort of join on key that is performed by the people at Netflix in order to put together these different data resolutions, right, which is data of the same phenomenon but from different sources and with different carrying very different signals in there.</p>
<p>35<br>
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:48,620<br>
So the device capabilities is captured usually by the static data and of course the other data, the Runtime memory and out of memory kill data.</p>
<p>36<br>
00:06:48,950 --> 00:07:04,162<br>
These are also, as I said, the data that will describe pretty accurately how is the user using that particular application on that particular hardware.</p>
<p>37<br>
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:17,566<br>
Now of course, when it comes to data and deer, there is nothing new that people at Netflix have introduced dealing with missing data for example, or incorporating knowledge of devices.</p>
<p>38<br>
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:26,062<br>
It's all stuff that it's part of the so called data cleaning and data collection strategy, right? Or data preparation.</p>
<p>39<br>
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:40,782<br>
That is, whatever you're going to do in order to make that data or a combination of these data sources, let's say, compatible with the way your machine learning model will understand or will read that data.</p>
<p>40<br>
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:58,638<br>
So if you think of a big data platform, the first step, the first challenge you have to deal, you have to deal with is how can I, first of all, collect the right amount of information, the right data, but also how to transform this data for my particular big data platform.</p>
<p>41<br>
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:12,798<br>
And that's something that, again, nothing new, nothing fancy, just basics, what we have been used to, what we are used to seeing now for the last decade or more, that's exactly what they do.</p>
<p>42<br>
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:15,222<br>
And now let me tell you something important.</p>
<p>43<br>
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,278<br>
Cybercriminals are evolving.</p>
<p>44<br>
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:22,446<br>
Their techniques and tactics are more advanced, intricate and dangerous than ever before.</p>
<p>45<br>
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:30,630<br>
Industries and governments around the world are fighting back on dealing new regulations meant to better protect data against this rising threat.</p>
<p>46<br>
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:39,262<br>
Today, the world of cybersecurity compliance is a complex one, and understanding the requirements your organization must adhere to can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>47<br>
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:42,178<br>
But not when the pack has your best architect.</p>
<p>48<br>
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:53,840<br>
Wolf, the leader in security operations, is on a mission to end cyber risk by giving organizations the protection, information and confidence they need to protect their people, technology and data.</p>
<p>49<br>

<p>52<br>
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,378<br>
I think that the most important part, though, I think are actually equally important.</p>
<p>53<br>
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:26,854<br>
But the way they treat runtime memory data and out of memory kill data is by using sliding windows.</p>
<p>54<br>
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:38,718<br>
So that's something that is really worth mentioning, because the way you would frame this problem is something is happening at some point in time and I have to kind of predict that event.</p>
<p>55<br>
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:49,326<br>
That is usually an outlier in the sense that these events are quite rare, fortunately, because Netflix would not be as usable as we believe it is.</p>
<p>56<br>
00:09:49,448 --> 00:10:04,110<br>
So you would like to predict these weird events by looking at a historical view or an historical amount of records that you have before this particular event, which is the kill of the application.</p>
<p>57<br>
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,870<br>
So the concept of the sliding window, the sliding window approach is something that comes as the most natural thing anyone would do.</p>
<p>58<br>
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,366<br>
And that's exactly what the researchers and Netflix have done.</p>
<p>59<br>
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:25,494<br>
So unexpectedly, in my opinion, they treated this problem as a time series, which is exactly what it is.</p>
<p>60<br>
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:26,190<br>
Now.</p>
<p>61<br>
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,754<br>
They.</p>
<p>62<br>
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:27,330<br>
Of course.</p>
<p>63<br>
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,426<br>
Use this sliding window with a different horizon.</p>
<p>64<br>
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:32,190<br>
Five minutes.</p>
<p>65<br>
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,838<br>
Four minutes.</p>
<p>66<br>
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,702<br>
Two minutes.</p>
<p>67<br>
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,366<br>
As close as possible to the event.</p>
<p>68<br>
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,886<br>
Because maybe there are some.</p>
<p>69<br>
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:39,762<br>
Let's say.</p>
<p>70<br>
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:45,678<br>
Other dynamics that can raise when you are very close to the event or when you are very far from it.</p>
<p>71<br>
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:50,166<br>
Like five minutes far from the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>72<br>
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:51,858<br>
Might have some other.</p>
<p>73<br>
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:52,410<br>
Let's say.</p>
<p>74<br>
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,986<br>
Diagrams or shapes in the data.</p>
<p>75<br>
00:10:56,168 --> 00:11:11,310<br>
So for example, you might have a certain number of allocations that keep growing and growing, but eventually they grow with a certain curve or a certain rate that you can measure when you are five to ten minutes far from the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>76<br>
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,566<br>
When you are two minutes far from the out of memory kill, probably this trend will change.</p>
<p>77<br>
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:30,800<br>
And so probably what you would expect is that the memory is already half or more saturated and therefore, for example, the operating system starts swapping or other things are happening that you are going to measure in this.</p>
<p>78<br>
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:39,730<br>
And that would give you a much better picture of what's going on in the, let's say, closest neighborhood of that event, the time window.</p>
<p>79<br>
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:51,042<br>
The sliding window and time window approach is definitely worth mentioning because this is something that you can apply if you think pretty much anywhere right now.</p>
<p>80<br>
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,050<br>
What they did.</p>
<p>81<br>
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:04,146<br>
In addition to having a time window, a sliding window, they also assign different levels to memory readings that are closer to the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>82<br>
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:10,062<br>
And usually these levels are higher and higher as we get closer and closer to the out of memory kill.</p>
<p>83<br>
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:15,402<br>
So this means that, for example, we would have, for a five minute window, we would have a level one.</p>
<p>84<br>
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:22,230<br>
Five minute means five minutes far from the out of memory kill, four minutes would be a level two.</p>
<p>85<br>
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:37,234<br>
Three minutes it's much closer would be a level three, two minutes would be a level four, which means like kind of the severity of the event as we get closer and closer to the actual event when the application is actually killed.</p>
<p>86<br>
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:51,474<br>
So by looking at this approach, nothing new there, even, I would say not even a seasoned data scientist would have understood that using a sliding window is the way to go.</p>
<p>87<br>
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:55,482<br>
I'm not saying that Netflix engineers are not seasoned enough.</p>
<p>88<br>
00:12:55,556 --> 00:13:04,350<br>
Actually they do a great job every day to keep giving us video streaming platforms that actually never fail or almost never fail.</p>
<p>89<br>
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,460<br>
So spot on there, guys, good job.</p>
<p>90<br>
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:27,738<br>
But looking at this sliding window approach, the direct consequence of this is that they can plot, they can do some sort of graphical analysis of the out of memory kills versus the memory usage that can give the reader or the data scientist a very nice picture of what's going on there.</p>
<p>91<br>
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:39,330<br>
And so you would have, for example, and I would definitely report some of the pictures, some of the diagrams and graphs in the show notes of this episode on the official website datascienceaton.com.</p>
<p>92<br>
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:48,238<br>
But essentially what you can see there is that there might be premature peaks at, let's say, a lower memory reading.</p>
<p>93<br>
00:13:48,334 --> 00:14:08,958<br>
And usually these are some kind of false positives or anomalies that should not be there, then it's possible to set a threshold where the threshold to start lowering the memory usage because after that threshold something nasty can happen and usually happens according to your data.</p>
<p>94<br>
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:18,740<br>
And then of course there is another graph about the Gaussian distribution or in fact no sharp peak at all.</p>
<p>95<br>
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,898<br>
That is like kills or out of memory.</p>
<p>96<br>
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:33,754<br>
Kills are more or less distributed in a normalized fashion and then of course there are the genuine peaks that indicate that kills near, let's say, the threshold.</p>
<p>97<br>
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:38,758<br>
And so usually you would see that after that particular threshold of memory usage.</p>
<p>98<br>
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:42,142<br>
You see most of the out of memory kills.</p>
<p>99<br>
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:45,570<br>
Which makes sense because given a particular device.</p>
<p>100<br>
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,298<br>
Which means certain amount of memories.</p>
<p>101<br>
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,338<br>
Certain memory characteristics.</p>
<p>102<br>
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:53,074<br>
Certain version of the SDK and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>103<br>
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:53,814<br>
You can say.</p>
<p>104<br>
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,090<br>
Okay.</p>
<p>105<br>
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:10,510<br>
Well for this device type I have this memory memory usage threshold and after this I see that I have a relatively high number of out of memory kills immediately after this threshold.</p>
<p>106<br>
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:18,150<br>
And this means that probably that is the threshold you would like to consider as the critical threshold you should never or almost never cross.</p>
<p>107<br>
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:38,758<br>
So once you have this picture in front of you, you can start thinking of implementing some mechanisms that can monitor the memory usage and of course kind of preemptively dialocate things or keep that memory threshold as low as possible with respect to the critical threshold.</p>
<p>108<br>
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:53,446<br>
So you can start implementing some logic that prevents the application from being killed by the operating system so that you would in fact reduce the rate of out of memory kills overall.</p>
<p>109<br>
00:15:53,578 --> 00:16:11,410<br>
Now, as always and as also the engineers state in their blog post, in the technical post, they say well, it's much more important for us to predict with a certain amount of false positive rather than false negatives.</p>
<p>110<br>
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,718<br>
False negatives means missing an out of memory kill that actually occurred but got not predicted.</p>
<p>111<br>
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:40,462<br>
If you are a regular listener of this podcast, that statement should resonate with you because this is exactly what happens, for example in healthcare applications, which means that doctors or algorithms that operate in healthcare would definitely prefer to have a bit more false positives rather than more false negatives.</p>
<p>112<br>
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:54,800<br>
Because missing that someone is sick means that you are not providing a cure and you're just sending the patient home when he or she is sick, right? That's the false positive, it's the mess.</p>
<p>113<br>
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,618<br>
So that's a false negative, it's the mess.</p>
<p>114<br>
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:09,486<br>
But having a false positive, what can go wrong with having a false positive? Well, probably you will undergo another test to make sure that the first test is confirmed or not.</p>
<p>115<br>
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:16,018<br>
So adding a false positive in this case is relatively okay with respect to having a false negative.</p>
<p>116<br>
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:19,398<br>
And that's exactly what happens to the Netflix application.</p>
<p>117<br>
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:32,094<br>
Now, I don't want to say that of course Netflix application is as critical as, for example, the application that predicts a cancer or an xray or something on an xray or disorder or disease of some sort.</p>
<p>118<br>
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:48,090<br>
But what I'm saying is that there are some analogies when it comes to machine learning and artificial intelligence and especially data science, the old school data science, there are several things that kind of are, let's say, invariant across sectors.</p>
<p>119<br>
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:56,826<br>
And so, you know, two worlds like the media streaming or video streaming and healthcare are of course very different from each other.</p>
<p>120<br>
00:17:56,888 --> 00:18:05,274<br>
But when it comes to machine learning and data science applications, well, there are a lot of analogies there.</p>
<p>121<br>
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:06,202<br>
And indeed.</p>
<p>122<br>
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:10,234<br>
In terms of the models that they use at Netflix to predict.</p>
<p>123<br>
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:24,322<br>
Once they have the sliding window data and essentially they have the ground truth of where this out of memory kill happened and what happened before to the memory of the application or the machine.</p>
<p>124<br>
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:24,774<br>
Well.</p>
<p>125<br>
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:30,514<br>
Then the models they use to predict these things is these events is Artificial Neural Networks.</p>
<p>126<br>
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:31,714<br>
Xg Boost.</p>
<p>127<br>
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:36,742<br>
Ada Boost or Adaptive Boosting Elastic Net with Softmax and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>128<br>
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,226<br>
So nothing fancy.</p>
<p>129<br>
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:45,046<br>
As you can see, Xg Boost is probably one of the most used I would have expected even random forest.</p>
<p>130<br>
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:47,120<br>
Probably they do, they've tried that.</p>
<p>131<br>
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:58,842<br>
But XGBoost is probably one of the most used models on kaggle competitions for a reason, because it works and it leverages a lot.</p>
<p>132<br>
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:04,880<br>
The data preparation step, that solves already more than half of the problem.</p>
<p>133<br>
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,270<br>
Thank you so much for listening.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Sometimes applications crash. Some other times applications crash because memory is exhausted. Such issues exist because of bugs in the code, or heavy memory usage for reasons that were not expected during design and implementation. Can we use machine learning to predict and eventually detect out of memory kills from the operating system?
Apparently, the Netflix app many of us use on a daily basis leverage ML and time series analysis to prevent OOM-kills.

100:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,034And here we are again with the season four of the Data Science at Home podcast.
200:00:09,142 --> 00:00:19,170This time we have something for you if you want to help us shape the data science leaders of the future, we have created the the Data Science at Home's Ambassador program.
300:00:19,340 --> 00:00:28,378Ambassadors are volunteers who are passionate about data science and want to give back to our growing community of data science professionals and enthusiasts.
400:00:28,534 --> 00:00:37,558You will be instrumental in helping us achieve our goal of raising awareness about the critical role of data science in cutting edge technologies.

600:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,234Welcome back to another episode of Data Science at Home podcast.
700:00:49,282 --> 00:00:55,426I'm Francesco Podcasting from the Regular Office of Amethyx Technologies, based in Belgium.
800:00:55,618 --> 00:01:02,914In this episode, I want to speak about a machine learning problem that has been formulated at Netflix.
900:01:03,022 --> 00:01:22,038And for the record, Netflix is not sponsoring this episode, though I still believe that this problem is a very well known problem, a very common one across factors, which is how to predict out of memory kill in an application and formulate this problem as a machine learning problem.
1000:01:22,184 --> 00:01:39,142So this is something that, as I said, is very interesting, not just because of Netflix, but because it allows me to explain a few points that, as I said, are kind of invariance across sectors.
1100:01:39,226 --> 00:01:56,218Regardless of your application, is a video streaming application or any other communication type of application, or a fintech application, or energy, or whatever, this memory kill, out of memory kill still occurs.
1200:01:56,314 --> 00:02:05,622And what is an out of memory kill? Well, it's essentially the extreme event in which the machine doesn't have any more memory left.
1300:02:05,756 --> 00:02:16,678And so usually the operating system can start eventually swapping, which means using the SSD or the hard drive as a source of memory.
1400:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,100But that, of course, will slow down a lot.
1500:02:19,430 --> 00:02:45,210And eventually when there is a bug or a memory leak, or if there are other applications running on the same machine, of course there is some kind of limiting factor that essentially kills the application, something that occurs from the operating system most of the time that kills the application in order to prevent the application from monopolizing the entire machine, the hardware of the machine.
1600:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,500And so this is a very important problem.
1700:02:49,070 --> 00:03:03,306Also, it is important to have an episode about this because there are some strategies that I've used at Netflix that are pretty much in line with what I]]></itunes:summary>

                                    <description><![CDATA[That deep learning alone is not sufficient to solve artificial general intelligence, is more and more accepted statement.
Generalist agents have great properties that can overcome some of the limitations of single-task deep learning models.
Be aware, we are still far from AGI, though.
 
So what are generalist agents?

I have a very interesting conversation with Ravin,  data scientist at Google where he uses data to inform decisions.</p>
<p>He has previously worked at Sweetgreen, designing systems that would benefit team members and communities through sustainable and healthy food, and SpaceX, creating tools that would ultimately launch rocket ships. </p>
<p>All opinions in this episode are his own and none of the companies he has worked for are represented.</p>

<p>Streamr is a layer zero protocol for real-time data which powers the decentralized Streamr pub/sub network. The technology works in tandem with companion blockchains - currently Ethereum and xDai chain - which are used for identity, security and payments. On top is the application layer, including the Data Union framework, Marketplace and Core, and all third party applications. </p>

The usual suspect is clearly Pandas, as the most widely used library and de-facto standard. However when data volumes increase and distributed algorithms are in place (according to a map-reduce paradigm of computation), Pandas no longer performs as expected. Other frameworks play a role in such context. </p>
<p>In this episode I explain the frameworks that are the best equivalent to Pandas in bigdata contexts.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode I make a non exhaustive list of machine learning tools and frameworks, written in Rust. Not all of them are mature enough for production environments. I believe that community effort can change this very quickly.
To make a comparison with the Python ecosystem I will cover frameworks for linear algebra (numpy), dataframes (pandas), off-the-shelf machine learning (scikit-learn), deep learning (tensorflow) and reinforcement learning (openAI).
Rust is the language of the future.Happy coding!

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best features of neural networks and machine learning models is to memorize patterns from training data and apply those to unseen observations. That's where the magic is. 
However, there are scenarios in which the same machine learning models learn patterns so well such that they can disclose some of the data they have been trained on. This phenomenon goes under the name of unintended memorization and it is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about a language generator that discloses the passwords, the credit card numbers and the social security numbers of the records it has been trained on. Or more generally, think about a synthetic data generator that can disclose the training data it is trying to protect. </p>
<p>In this episode I explain why unintended memorization is a real problem in machine learning. Except for differentially private training there is no other way to mitigate such a problem in realistic conditions.
At <a href='https://pryml.io'>Pryml</a> we are very aware of this. Which is why we have been developing a synthetic data generation technology that is not affected by such an issue.</p>

All the above techniques try to do one simple thing: keeping the data private while sharing it with third parties. Unfortunately, they are not the silver bullet to confidentiality. 

All the players in the synthetic data space rely on simplistic techniques that are not secure, might not be compliant and risky for production.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>This is the fourth and last episode of mini series "The dark side of AI". 
I am your host Francesco and I’m with Chiara Tonini from London. The title of today’s episode is Bias in the machine </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>C: Francesco, today we are starting with an infuriating discussion. Are you ready to be angry? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: yeah sure is this about brexit? 
No, I don’t talk about that. In 1986 the New York City’s Rockefeller University conducted a study on breast and uterine cancers and their link to obesity. Like in all clinical trials up to that point, the subjects of the study were all men. 
So Francesco, do you see a problem with this approach? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: No problem at all, as long as those men had a perfectly healthy uterus.
In medicine, up to the end of the 20th century, medical studies and clinical trials were conducted on men, medicine dosage and therapy calculated on men (white men). The female body has historically been considered an exception, or variation, from a male body. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Like Eve coming from Adam’s rib. I thought we were past that...
When the female body has been under analysis, the focus was on the difference between it and the male body, the so-called “bikini approach”: the reproductive organs are different, therefore we study those, and those only. For a long time medicine assumed this was the only difference. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh good ...
This has led to a hugely harmful fallout across society. Because women had reproductive organs, they should reproduce, and all else about them was deemed uninteresting. Still today, they consider a woman without children somehow to have betrayed her biological destiny. This somehow does not apply to a man without children, who also has reproductive organs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: so this is an example of a very specific type of bias in medicine, regarding clinical trials and medical studies, that is not only harmful for the purposes of these studies, but has ripple effects in all of society
Only in the 2010 a serious conversation has started about the damage caused by not including women in clinical trials. There are many many examples (which we list in the references for this episode). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Give me one
Researchers consider cardiovascular disease a male disease - they even call it “the widower”. They conduct studies on male samples. But it turns out, the symptoms of a heart attack, especially the ones leading up to one, are different in women. This led to doctors not recognising or dismissing the early symptoms in women. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: I was reading that women are also subject to chronic pain much more than men: for example migraines, and pain related to endometriosis. But there is extensive evidence now of doctors dismissing women’s pain, as either imaginary, or “inevitable”, like it is a normal state of being and does not need a cure at all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The failure of the medical community as a whole to recognise this obvious bias up to the 21st century is an example of how insidious the problem of bias is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 3 fundamental types of bias: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li>One: Stochastic drift: you train your model on a dataset, and you validate the model on a split of the training set. When you apply your model out in the world, you systematically add bias in the predictions due to the training data being too specific</li>
<li>Two: The bias in the model, introduced by your choice of the parameters of your model.  </li>
<li>Three: The bias in your training sample: people put training samples together, and people have culture, experience, and prejudice. As we will see today, this is the most dangerous and subtle bias. Today we’ll talk about this bias.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>Bias is a warping of our understanding of reality. We see reality through the lens of our experience and our culture. The origin of bias can date back to traditions going back centuries, and is so ingrained in our way of thinking, that we don’t even see it anymore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: And let me add, when it comes to machine learning, we see reality through the lens of data. Bias is everywhere, and we could spend hours and hours talking about it. It’s complicated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s about to become more complicated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: of course, if I know you…
Let’s throw artificial intelligence in the mix. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: You know, there was a happier time when this sentence didn’t fill me with a sense of dread... 
ImageNet is an online database of over 14 million photos, compiled more than a decade ago at Stanford University. They used it to train machine learning algorithms for image recognition and computer vision, and played an important role in the rise of deep learning. We’ve all played with it, right? The cats and dogs classifier when learning Tensorflow? (I am a dog by the way. )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: ImageNet has been a critical asset for computer-vision research. There was an annual international competition to create algorithms that could most accurately label subsets of images. 
In 2012, a team from the University of Toronto used a Convolutional Neural Network to handily win the top prize. That moment is widely considered a turning point in the development of contemporary AI. The final year of the ImageNet competition was 2017, and accuracy in classifying objects in the limited subset had risen from 71% to 97%. But that subset did not include the “Person” category, where the accuracy was much lower... 
ImageNet contained photos of thousands of people, with labels. This included straightforward tags like “teacher,” “dancer” and “plumber”, as well as highly charged labels like “failure, loser” and “slut, slovenly woman, trollop.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Uh Oh. 
Then “ImageNet Roulette” was created, by an artist called Trevor Paglen and a Microsoft researcher named Kate Crawford. It was a digital art project, where you could upload your photo and let the classifier identify you, based on the labels of the database. Imagine how well that went. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: I bet it did’t work
Of course it didn’t work. Random people were classified as “orphans” or “non-smoker” or “alcoholic”. Somebody with glasses was a “nerd”. Tabong Kima, a 24-year old African American, was classified as “offender” and “wrongdoer”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: and there it is. 
Quote from Trevor Paglen: “We want to show how layers of bias and racism and misogyny move from one system to the next. The point is to let people see the work that is being done behind the scenes, to see how we are being processed and categorized all the time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: The ImageNet labels were applied by thousands of unknown people, most likely in the United States, hired by the team from Stanford, and working through the crowdsourcing service Amazon Mechanical Turk. They earned pennies for each photo they labeled, churning through hundreds of labels an hour. The labels were not verified in any way : if a labeler thought someone looks “shady”, this label is just a result of their prejudice, but has no basis in reality.
As they did, biases were baked into the database. Paglen quote again: “The way we classify images is a product of our worldview,” he said. “Any kind of classification system is always going to reflect the values of the person doing the classifying.” They defined what a “loser” looked like. And a “slut.” And a “wrongdoer.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: The labels originally came from another sprawling collection of data called WordNet, a kind of conceptual dictionary for machines built by researchers at Princeton University in the 1980s. But with these inflammatory labels included, the Stanford researchers may not have realized what they were doing.
What is happening here is the transferring of bias from one system to the next. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tech jobs, in past decades but still today, predominantly go to white males from a narrow social class. Inevitably, they imprint the technology with their worldview. So their algorithms learn that a person of color is a criminal, and a woman with a certain look is a slut. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m not saying they do it on purpose, but the lack of diversity in the tech industry translates into a narrower world view, which has real consequences in the quality of AI systems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Diversity in tech teams is often framed as an equality issue (which of course it is), but there are enormous advantages in it: it allows to create that cognitive diversity that will reflect into superior products or services. 
I believe this is an ongoing problem. In recent months, researchers have shown that face-recognition services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and IBM can be biased against women and people of color. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crawford and Paglen argue this: 
“In many narratives around AI it is assumed that ongoing technical improvements will resolve all problems and limitations. 
But what if the opposite is true? What if the challenge of getting computers to “describe what they see” will always be a problem? The automated interpretation of images is an inherently social and political project, rather than a purely technical one. Understanding the politics within AI systems matters more than ever, as they are quickly moving into the architecture of social institutions: deciding whom to interview for a job, which students are paying attention in class, which suspects to arrest, and much else.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: You are using the words “interpretation of images” here, as opposed to “description” or “classification”. Certain images depict something concrete, with an objective reality. Like an apple. But other images… not so much? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>ImageNet contain images only corresponding to nouns (not verbs for example). Noun categories such as “apple” are well defined. 
But not all nouns are created equal. Linguist George Lakoff points out that the concept of an “apple” is more nouny than the concept of “light”, which in turn is more nouny than a concept such as “health.” 
Nouns occupy various places on an axis from concrete to abstract, and from descriptive to judgmental. The images corresponding to these nouns become more and more ambiguous.
These gradients have been erased in the logic of ImageNet. Everything is flattened out and pinned to a label. 
The results can be problematic, illogical, and cruel, especially when it comes to labels applied to people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: so when an image is interpreted as Drug Addict, Crazy, Hypocrite, Spinster, Schizophrenic, Mulatto, Red Neck… this is not an objective description of reality, it’s somebody’s worldview coming to the surface. 
The selection of images for these categories skews the meaning in ways that are gendered, racialized, ableist, and ageist. ImageNet is an object lesson in what happens when people are categorized like objects. 
And this practice has only become more common in recent years, often inside the big AI companies, where there is no way for outsiders to see how images are being ordered and classified. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bizarre thing about these systems is that they remind of early 20th century criminologists like Lombroso, or phrenologists (including Nazi scientists), and physiognomy in general. This was a discipline founded on the assumption that there is a relationship between an image of a person and the character of that person. If you are a murderer, or a Jew, the shape of your head for instance will tell. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: In reaction to these ideas, Rene’ Magritte produced that famous painting of the pipe with the tag “This is not a pipe”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You know that famous photograph of the soldier kissing the nurse at the end of the second world war? The nurse came public about it when she was like 90 years old, and told how this total stranger in the street had grabbed her and kissed her. This is a picture of sexual harassment. And knowing that, it does not seem romantic anymore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: not romantic at all indeed

Images do not describe themselves. This is a feature that artists have explored for centuries. We see those images differently when we see how they’re labeled. The correspondence between image, label, and referent is fluid. What’s more, those relations can change over time as the cultural context of an image shifts, and can mean different things depending on who looks, and where they are located. Images are open to interpretation and reinterpretation. Entire subfields of philosophy, art history, and media theory are dedicated to teasing out all the nuances of the unstable relationship between images and meanings.
The common mythos of AI and the data it draws on, is that they are objectively and scientifically classifying the world. But it’s not true, everywhere there is politics, ideology, prejudices, and all of the subjective stuff of history. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: When we survey the most widely used training sets, we find that this is the rule rather than the exception.
Training sets are the foundation on which contemporary machine-learning systems are built. They are central to how AI systems recognize and interpret the world.
By looking at the construction of these training sets and their underlying structures, we discover many unquestioned assumptions that are shaky and skewed. These assumptions inform the way AI systems work—and fail—to this day.
And the impenetrability of the algorithms, the impossibility of reconstructing the decision-making of a NN, hides the bias further away from scrutiny. When an algorithm is a black box and you can’t look inside, you have no way of analysing its bias. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the skewness and bias of these algorithms have real effects in society, the more you use AI in the judicial system, in medicine, the job market, in security systems based on facial recognition, the list goes on and on. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last year Google unveiled BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). It’s an AI system that learns to talk: it’s a Natural Language Processing engine to generate written (or spoken) language. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: we have an <a href='https://datascienceathome.com/more-powerful-deep-learning-with-transformers/'>episode</a>  in which we explain all that </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
They trained it from lots and lots of digitized information, as varied as old books, Wikipedia entries and news articles. They baked decades and even centuries of biases — along with a few new ones — into all that material. So for instance BERT is extremely sexist: it associates with male almost all professions and positive attributes (except for “mom”). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>BERT is widely used in industry and academia. For example it can interpret news headlines automatically. Even Google’s search engine use it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Try googling “CEO”, and you get out a gallery of images of old white men.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: such a pervasive and flawed AI system can propagate inequality at scale. And it’s super dangerous because it’s subtle. Especially in industry, query results will not be tested and examined for bias. AI is a black box and researchers take results at face value. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many cases of algorithm-based discrimination in the job market. Targeting candidates for tech jobs for instance, may be done by algorithms that will not recognise women as potential candidates. Therefore, they will not be exposed to as many job ads as men. Or, automated HR systems will rank them lower (for the same CV) and screen them out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the US, algorithms are used to calculate bail. The majority of the prison population in the US is composed of people of colour, as a result of a systemic bias that goes back centuries. An algorithm learns that a person of colour is more likely to commit a crime, is more likely to not be able to afford bail, is more likely to violate parole. Therefore, people of colour will receive harsher punishments for the same crime. This amplifies this inequality at scale. </p>
<p> </p>
Conclusion
<p> </p>
<p>Question everything, never take predictions of your models at face value. Always question how your training samples have been put together, who put them together, when and in what context. Always remember that your model produces an interpretation of reality, not a faithful depiction. 
Treat reality responsibly. </p>

<p>This is the fourth and last episode of mini series <em>"The dark side of AI"</em>. <br>
I am your host Francesco and I’m with Chiara Tonini from London. The title of today’s episode is B<em>ias in the machine</em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>C: Francesco, today we are starting with an infuriating discussion. Are you ready to be angry? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: yeah sure is this about brexit? <br>
No, I don’t talk about that. In 1986 the New York City’s Rockefeller University conducted a study on breast and uterine cancers and their link to obesity. Like in all clinical trials up to that point, the subjects of the study were all men. <br>
So Francesco, do you see a problem with this approach? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: No problem at all, as long as those men had a perfectly healthy uterus.<br>
In medicine, up to the end of the 20th century, medical studies and clinical trials were conducted on men, medicine dosage and therapy calculated on men (white men). The female body has historically been considered an exception, or variation, from a male body. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Like Eve coming from Adam’s rib. I thought we were past that...<br>
When the female body has been under analysis, the focus was on the difference between it and the male body, the so-called<em> “bikini approach”</em>: the reproductive organs are different, therefore we study those, and those only. For a long time medicine assumed this was the only difference. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh good ...<br>
This has led to a hugely harmful fallout across society. Because women had reproductive organs, they should reproduce, and all else about them was deemed uninteresting. Still today, they consider a woman without children somehow to have betrayed her biological destiny. This somehow does not apply to a man without children, who also has reproductive organs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: so this is an example of a very specific type of bias in medicine, regarding clinical trials and medical studies, that is not only harmful for the purposes of these studies, but has ripple effects in all of society<br>
Only in the 2010 a serious conversation has started about the damage caused by not including women in clinical trials. There are many many examples (which we list in the references for this episode). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Give me one<br>
Researchers consider cardiovascular disease a male disease - they even call it “the widower”. They conduct studies on male samples. But it turns out, the symptoms of a heart attack, especially the ones leading up to one, are different in women. This led to doctors not recognising or dismissing the early symptoms in women. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: I was reading that women are also subject to chronic pain much more than men: for example migraines, and pain related to endometriosis. But there is extensive evidence now of doctors dismissing women’s pain, as either imaginary, or “inevitable”, like it is a normal state of being and does not need a cure at all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The failure of the medical community as a whole to recognise this obvious bias up to the 21st century is an example of how insidious the problem of bias is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 3 fundamental types of bias: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li>One: Stochastic drift: you train your model on a dataset, and you validate the model on a split of the training set. When you apply your model out in the world, you systematically add bias in the predictions due to the training data being too specific</li>
<li>Two: The bias in the model, introduced by your choice of the parameters of your model.  </li>
<li>Three: The bias in your training sample: people put training samples together, and people have culture, experience, and prejudice. As we will see today, this is the most dangerous and subtle bias. Today we’ll talk about this bias.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>Bias is a warping of our understanding of reality. We see reality through the lens of our experience and our culture. The origin of bias can date back to traditions going back centuries, and is so ingrained in our way of thinking, that we don’t even see it anymore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: And let me add, when it comes to machine learning, we see reality through the lens of data. Bias is everywhere, and we could spend hours and hours talking about it. It’s complicated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s about to become more complicated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: of course, if I know you…<br>
Let’s throw artificial intelligence in the mix. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: You know, there was a happier time when this sentence didn’t fill me with a sense of dread... <br>
ImageNet is an online database of over 14 million photos, compiled more than a decade ago at Stanford University. They used it to train machine learning algorithms for image recognition and computer vision, and played an important role in the rise of deep learning. We’ve all played with it, right? The cats and dogs classifier when learning Tensorflow? (I am a dog by the way. )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: ImageNet has been a critical asset for computer-vision research. There was an annual international competition to create algorithms that could most accurately label subsets of images. <br>
In 2012, a team from the University of Toronto used a Convolutional Neural Network to handily win the top prize. That moment is widely considered a turning point in the development of contemporary AI. The final year of the ImageNet competition was 2017, and accuracy in classifying objects in the limited subset had risen from 71% to 97%. But that subset did not include the “Person” category, where the accuracy was much lower... <br>
ImageNet contained photos of thousands of people, with labels. This included straightforward tags like “teacher,” “dancer” and “plumber”, as well as highly charged labels like “failure, loser” and “slut, slovenly woman, trollop.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Uh Oh. <br>
Then “ImageNet Roulette” was created, by an artist called Trevor Paglen and a Microsoft researcher named Kate Crawford. It was a digital art project, where you could upload your photo and let the classifier identify you, based on the labels of the database. Imagine how well that went. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: I bet it did’t work<br>
Of course it didn’t work. Random people were classified as “orphans” or “non-smoker” or “alcoholic”. Somebody with glasses was a “nerd”. Tabong Kima, a 24-year old African American, was classified as “offender” and “wrongdoer”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: and there it is. <br>
Quote from Trevor Paglen: “We want to show how layers of bias and racism and misogyny move from one system to the next. The point is to let people see the work that is being done behind the scenes, to see how we are being processed and categorized all the time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: The ImageNet labels were applied by thousands of unknown people, most likely in the United States, hired by the team from Stanford, and working through the crowdsourcing service Amazon Mechanical Turk. They earned pennies for each photo they labeled, churning through hundreds of labels an hour. The labels were not verified in any way : if a labeler thought someone looks “shady”, this label is just a result of their prejudice, but has no basis in reality.<br>
As they did, biases were baked into the database. Paglen quote again: “The way we classify images is a product of our worldview,” he said. “Any kind of classification system is always going to reflect the values of the person doing the classifying.” They defined what a “loser” looked like. And a “slut.” And a “wrongdoer.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: The labels originally came from another sprawling collection of data called WordNet, a kind of conceptual dictionary for machines built by researchers at Princeton University in the 1980s. But with these inflammatory labels included, the Stanford researchers may not have realized what they were doing.<br>
What is happening here is the transferring of bias from one system to the next. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tech jobs, in past decades but still today, predominantly go to white males from a narrow social class. Inevitably, they imprint the technology with their worldview. So their algorithms learn that a person of color is a criminal, and a woman with a certain look is a slut. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m not saying they do it on purpose, but the lack of diversity in the tech industry translates into a narrower world view, which has real consequences in the quality of AI systems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Diversity in tech teams is often framed as an equality issue (which of course it is), but there are enormous advantages in it: it allows to create that cognitive diversity that will reflect into superior products or services. <br>
I believe this is an ongoing problem. In recent months, researchers have shown that face-recognition services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and IBM can be biased against women and people of color. </p>

Nouns occupy various places on an axis from concrete to abstract, and from descriptive to judgmental. The images corresponding to these nouns become more and more ambiguous.<br>
These gradients have been erased in the logic of ImageNet. Everything is flattened out and pinned to a label. <br>
The results can be problematic, illogical, and cruel, especially when it comes to labels applied to people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: so when an image is interpreted as Drug Addict, Crazy, Hypocrite, Spinster, Schizophrenic, Mulatto, Red Neck… this is not an objective description of reality, it’s somebody’s worldview coming to the surface. <br>
The selection of images for these categories skews the meaning in ways that are gendered, racialized, ableist, and ageist. ImageNet is an object lesson in what happens when people are categorized like objects. <br>
And this practice has only become more common in recent years, often inside the big AI companies, where there is no way for outsiders to see how images are being ordered and classified. </p>

Episode transcript
<p>We always hear the word “metadata”, usually in a sentence that goes like this</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Your Honor, I swear, we were not collecting users data, just metadata.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Usually the guy saying this sentence is Zuckerberg, but could be anybody from Amazon or Google. “Just” metadata, so no problem. This is one of the biggest lies about the reality of data collection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Ok the first question is, what the hell is metadata? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Metadata is data about data. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Ok… still not clear.
Imagine you make a phone call to your mum. How often do you call your mum, Francesco?

F: Every day of course! (coughing)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good boy! Ok, so let’s talk about today’s phone call. Let’s call “data” the stuff that you and your mum actually said. What did you talk about? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: She was giving me the recipe for her famous lasagna. </p>
<p>So your mum’s lasagna is the DATA. What is the metadata of this phone call? The lasagna has data of its own attached to it: the date and time when the conversation happened, the duration of the call, the unique hardware identifiers of your phone and your mum’s phone, the identifiers of the two sim cards, the location of the cell towers that pinged the call, the GPS coordinates of the phones themselves. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: yeah well, this lasagna comes with a lot of data :) </p>
<p>And this is assuming that this data is not linked to any other data like your Facebook account or your web browsing history. More of that later. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Whoa Whoa Whoa, ok. Let’s put a pin in that. Going back to the “basic” metadata that you describe. I think we understand the concept of data about data. I am sure you did your research and you would love to paint me a dystopian nightmare, as always. Tell us why is this a big deal? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Metadata is a very big deal. In fact, metadata is far more “useful” than the actual data, where by “useful” I mean that it allows a third party to learn about you and your whole life. What I am saying is, the fact that you talk with your mum every day for 15 minutes is telling me more about you than the content of the actual conversations. In a way, the content does not matter. Only the metadata matters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Ok, can you explain this point a bit more? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: you work in an office in Brussels, and you go by car. Every day, you use your time in the car while you go home to call your mum. So every day around 6pm, a cell tower along the path from your office to your home pings a call from your phone to your mum’s phone. Someone who is looking at your metadata, knows exactly where you are while you call your mum. Every day you will talk about something different, and it doesn't really matter.  Your location will come through loud and clear. A lot of additional information can be deduced from this too: for example, you are moving along a motorway, therefore you have a car. The metadata of a call to mum now becomes information on where you are at 6pm, and the way you travel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: I see. So metadata about the phone call is, in fact, real data about me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exactly. YOU are what is interesting, not your mum’s lasagna.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: you say so because you haven’t tried my mum’s lasagna. But I totally get your point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Now, imagine that one day, instead of going straight home, you decide to go somewhere else. Maybe you are secretly looking for another job. Your metadata is recording the fact that after work you visit the offices of a rival company. Maybe you are a journalist and you visit your anonymous source. Your metadata records wherever you go, and one of these places is your secret meeting with your source. Anyone’s metadata can be combined with yours. There will be someone who was with you at the time and place of your secret meeting. Anyone who comes in contact with you can be tagged and monitored. Now their anonymity has been reduced. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: I get it. So, compared to the content of my conversation, its metadata contains more actionable information. And this is the most useful, and most precious, kind of information about me. What I do, what I like, who I am, beyond the particular conversation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Precisely. If companies like <a href='http://facebook.com'>Facebook</a> or the phone companies had the explicit permission to collect all the users’ data, including all content of conversations, it’s still the metadata that would  generate the most actionable information. They would probably throw the content of conversations away. In the vast majority of instances, the content does not matter. Unless you are an actual spy talking about state secrets, nobody cares. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Let’s stay on the spy point for a minute. One could say, So what? As I have heard this many times. So what if my metadata contains actionable information, and there are entities that collect it. If I am an honest person, I have nothing to hide. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
There are two aspects to the problem of privacy. Government surveillance, and corporate - in other words private - surveillance. 
Government surveillance is a topic that has been covered flawlessly by Edward Snowden in his book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Record-Edward-Snowden/dp/1250237238'>“Permanent Record”</a>, and in the documentary about his activity, “Citizenfour”. Which I both recommend, and in fact I think every data scientist should read and watch. 
Let’s just briefly mention the obvious: just because something comes from a government, it does not mean it’s legal or legitimate, or even ethical or moral. What if your government is corrupt, or authoritarian. What if you are a dissident and you are fighting for human rights. What if you are a journalist, trying to uncover government corruption. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: In other words,  it is a false equivalence to say that protecting your privacy has anything to do with having something to hide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Mass surveillance of private citizens without cause is a danger to individual freedom as well as civil liberties. Government exists to serve its citizens, not the other way around. To freely paraphrase Snowden, as individuals have no power compared to the government, the only way the system works is if the government is completely transparent to the citizens, so that they can collectively change it, and at the same time the single citizens are opaque to the government, so that it cannot abuse its power. But today the opposite happens: we citizens are completely naked and exposed in front of a completely opaque government machine, with secret surveillance programs on us, that we don’t even know exist. We are not free to self-determine, or do anything about government power, really.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> 
F: We could really talk for days and days about government mass surveillance. But let’s go back to metadata, and let’s talk about the commercial use of it. Metadata for sale. You mentioned this term, “corporate surveillance”. It sounds…. Ominous. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
We live in privacy hell, Francesco. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: I get that. According to your research, where can we find metadata?  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
First of all, metadata is everywhere. We are swimming in it. In each and every interaction between two people, that make use of digital technology, metadata is generated automatically, without the user’s consent. When two people interact, two machines also interact, recording the “context” of this interaction. Who we are, when, where, why, what we want. 

F: And that doesn’t seem avoidable. In fact metadata must be generated by devices and software to just work properly. I look at it as an intrinsic component that cannot be removed from the communication system, whatever it is. The problem is who owns it. So tell me, who has such data? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
It does not matter, because it’s all for sale. Which means, we are for sale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Ok, holy s**t, this keeps getting darker. Let’s have a practical example, shall we? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Have you booked a flight recently? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Yep. I’m going to Berlin, and in fact so are you. For a hackathon, no less. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Have you ever heard of a company called <a href='https://adara.com/'>Adara</a>? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: No… Cannot say that I have. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Adara is a “Predictive Traveler Intelligence” company. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: sounds pretty pretentious. Kinda douchy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
This came up on the terrifying twitter account of Wolfie Christl, author among other things of a great report about corporate surveillance for Cracked Labs. Go check him out on twitter, he’s great. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Sure I will add what I find to the show notes of this episode. Oh and by the way you can find all this stuff on datascienceathome.com 
Sorry go ahead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Adara collects data - metadata - about travel-related online searches, purchases, devices, passenger records, loyalty program records. Data from clients that include major airlines, major airports, hotel chains and car rental chains. It creates a profile, a “traveler graph” in real time, for 750 million people around the world. A profile based on personal identifiers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: uhh uhh Then what?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Then Adara sells these profiles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Ok… I have to say, the box that I tick giving consent to the third-party use of my personal data when I use an airline website does not quite convey how far my data actually goes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Consent. LOL. Adara calculates a: “traveler value score” based on customer behaviour and needs across the global travel ecosystem, over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The score is in the Salesforce Service Cloud, for sale to anyone. 
This score, and your profile, determine the personalisation of travel offers and treatment, before purchase, during booking, post purchase, at check in, in airport, at destination. 
In their own website, Adara explains how customer service agents for their myriad of clients - for example a front desk agent at a hotel - can instantly see the Traveler value score. Therefore they will treat you differently based on this score. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Oh so if you have money to spend they will treat you differently</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
The score is used to assess your potential value, to inform service and customer service strategies for you, as well as personalised messaging and relevant offers. And of course, the pricing you see when you look for flights. Low score? Prepare yourself to wait to have your call rerouted to a customer service agent. Would you ever tick a box to give consent to this? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: Fuck no. How is this even legal? What about the GDPR? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
It is, in fact, illegal. Adara is based in the US, but they collect data through data warehouses in the Netherlands. They claim they are GDPR-compliant. However, they collect all the data, and then decide on the specific business use, which is definitely not GDPR compliant. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: exactly! According to GDPR the user has to know in advance what the business use of the data they are giving consent for!!
With GDPR and future regulations, there is a way to control how the data is used and with what purpose. Regulations are still blurred or undefined when it comes to metadata. For example, there’s no regulation for the number of records in a database or the timestamp when such record  was created. As a matter of fact data is useless without metadata. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
One cannot even collect data without metadata. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Whatsapp, telegram, Facebook messenger... they all create metadata. So one might say “I’ve got end-to-end encryption, buddy”. Sure thing. How about the metadata attached to that encrypted gibberish nobody is really interested in? To show you how unavoidable the concept of metadata is, even Signal developed by the Signal Foundation which is considered the truly end-to-end and open source protocol for confidential information exchange, can see metadata. At Signal they claim they just don’t keep it, as they also state in the Signal’s privacy policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
"Certain information (e.g. a recipient's identifier, an encrypted message body, etc.) is transmitted to us solely for the purpose of placing calls or transmitting messages. Unless otherwise stated below, this information is only kept as long as necessary to place each call or transmit each message, and is not used for any other purpose." 
This is one of those issues that shall be solved with legislation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But like money laundering, your data is caught in a storm of transactions so intricate that at a certain point, how do you even check...
All participating companies share customer data with each other (a process called value exchange). They let marketers utilize the data, for example to target people after they have searched for flights or hotels. Adara creates audience segments and sells them, for example to Google, for advertisement targeting. The consumer data broker LiveRamp for example lists Adara as a data provider. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: consumer data broker. I am starting to get what you mean when you say that we are for sale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Let’s talk about LiveRamp, part of Acxiom. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: there they go... Acxiom... I heard of them </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
They self-describe as an “Identity Resolution Platform”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: I mean, George Orwell would be proud. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Their mission? “To connect offline data and online data back to a single identifier”. In other words, clients can “resolve all” of their “offline and online identifiers back to the individual consumer”. 
Various digital profiles, like the ones generated on social media or when you visit a website, are matched to databases which contains names, postal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, geo locations and IP addresses, online and mobile identifiers, such as cookie and device IDs. 

F: well, all this stuff is possible if and only if someone gets in possession of all these profiles, or well... they purchase them. Still, what the f**k. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
A cute example? Imagine you register on any random website but you don’t want to give them your home address. They just buy it from LiveRamp, which gets it from your phone geolocation data - which is for sale. Where does your phone sit still for 12 hours every night? That’s your home address. Easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: And they definitely know how much time do I spend at the gym, without even checking my Instagram! Ok this is another level of creepy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Clients of LiveRamp can upload their own consumer data to the platform, combine it with data from hundreds of 100 third-party data providers, and then utilize it on more than 500 marketing technology platforms. They can use this data to find and target people with specific characteristics, to recognize and track consumers across devices and platforms, to profile and categorize them, to personalize content for them, and to measure how they behave. For example, clients could “recognize a website visitor” and “provide a customized offer” based on extensive profile data, without requiring said user to log in to the website. Furthermore, LiveRamp has a data store, for other companies to “buy and sell valuable customer data”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: What is even the point of giving me the choice to consent to anything online?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
In short, there is no point. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F: it seems we are so behind with regulations on data sharing. GDPR is not cutting it, not really. With programmatic advertising we have created a monster that has really grown out of control. 
So: our lives are completely transparent to private corporations, that constantly surveil us en-masse, and exploit all of our data to sell us shit. How does this affect our freedom? How about we just don’t buy it? Can it be that simple? And I would not take a no for an answer here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
F:  oh crap!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m going to read you a passage from Permanent Record:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who among us can predict the future? Who would dare to? 
The answer to the first question is no one, really, and the answer to the second is everyone, especially every government and business on the planet. This is what that data of ours is used for. Algorithms analyze it for patterns of established behaviour in order to extrapolate behaviours to come, a type of digital prophecy that’s only slightly more accurate that analog methods like palm reading. Once you go digging into the actual technical mechanisms by which predictability is calculated, you come to understand that its science is, in fact, anti-scientific, and fatally misnamed: predictability is actually manipulation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
A website that tells you that because you liked book 1 then you might also like book 2, isn’t offering an educated guess as much as a mechanism of subtle coercion. We can’t allow ourselves to be used in this way, to be used against the future. We can’t permit our data to be used to sell us the very things that must not be sold, such as journalism. [....] 
We can’t let the god-like surveillance we’re under be used to “calculate” our citizenship scores, or to “predict” our criminal activity; to tell us what kind of education we can have, or what kind of job we can have [...], to discriminate against us based on our financial, legal, and medical histories, not to mention our ethnicity or race, which are constructs that data often assumes or imposes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
[...] if we allow [our data] to be used to identify us, then it will be used to victimize us, even to modify us - to remake the very essence of our humanity in the image of the technology that seeks its control. Of course, all of the above has already happened. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: In other words, we are surveilled and our data collected, and used to affect every aspect of our lives - what we read, what movies we watch, where we travel, what we buy, who we date, what we study, where we work… This is a self-fulfilling prophecy for all of humanity, and the prophet is a stupid, imperfect algorithm optimised just to make money. 
So I guess my message of today for all Data Scientists out there is this: just… don't. </p>

<p>We always hear the word “metadata”, usually in a sentence that goes like this</p>

F: I get that. According to your research, where can we find metadata?  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
First of all, metadata is everywhere. We are swimming in it. In each and every interaction between two people, that make use of digital technology, metadata is generated automatically, without the user’s consent. When two people interact, two machines also interact, recording the “context” of this interaction. Who we are, when, where, why, what we want. <br>
<br>
F: And that doesn’t seem avoidable. In fact metadata must be generated by devices and software to just work properly. I look at it as an intrinsic component that cannot be removed from the communication system, whatever it is. The problem is who owns it. So tell me, who has such data? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
It does not matter, because it’s all for sale. Which means, we are for sale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: Ok, holy s**t, this keeps getting darker. Let’s have a practical example, shall we? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Have you booked a flight recently? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: Yep. I’m going to Berlin, and in fact so are you. For a hackathon, no less. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Have you ever heard of a company called <a href='https://adara.com/'>Adara</a>? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: No… Cannot say that I have. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Adara is a “Predictive Traveler Intelligence” company. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: sounds pretty pretentious. Kinda douchy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
This came up on the terrifying twitter account of Wolfie Christl, author among other things of a great report about corporate surveillance for Cracked Labs. Go check him out on twitter, he’s great. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: Sure I will add what I find to the show notes of this episode. Oh and by the way you can find all this stuff on datascienceathome.com <br>
Sorry go ahead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Adara collects data - metadata - about travel-related online searches, purchases, devices, passenger records, loyalty program records. Data from clients that include major airlines, major airports, hotel chains and car rental chains. It creates a profile, a “traveler graph” in real time, for 750 million people around the world. A profile based on personal identifiers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: uhh uhh Then what?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Then Adara sells these profiles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: Ok… I have to say, the box that I tick giving consent to the third-party use of my personal data when I use an airline website does not quite convey how far my data actually goes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Consent. LOL. Adara calculates a: <em>“traveler value score” based on customer behaviour and needs across the global travel ecosystem, over time.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The score is in the Salesforce Service Cloud, for sale to anyone. <br>
This score, and your profile, determine the personalisation of travel offers and treatment, before purchase, during booking, post purchase, at check in, in airport, at destination. <br>
In their own website, Adara explains how customer service agents for their myriad of clients - for example a front desk agent at a hotel - can instantly see the <em>Traveler value score</em>. Therefore they will treat you differently based on this score. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: Oh so if you have money to spend they will treat you differently</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
The score is used to assess your potential value, to inform service and customer service strategies for you, as well as personalised messaging and relevant offers. And of course, the pricing you see when you look for flights. Low score? Prepare yourself to wait to have your call rerouted to a customer service agent. Would you ever tick a box to give consent to this? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: Fuck no. How is this even legal? What about the GDPR? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
It is, in fact, illegal. Adara is based in the US, but they collect data through data warehouses in the Netherlands. They claim they are GDPR-compliant. However, they collect all the data, and then decide on the specific business use, which is definitely not GDPR compliant. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: exactly! According to GDPR the user has to know in advance what the business use of the data they are giving consent for!!<br>
With GDPR and future regulations, there is a way to control how the data is used and with what purpose. Regulations are still blurred or undefined when it comes to metadata. For example, there’s no regulation for the number of records in a database or the timestamp when such record  was created. As a matter of fact data is useless without metadata. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
One cannot even collect data without metadata. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Whatsapp, telegram, Facebook messenger... they all create metadata. So one might say “I’ve got end-to-end encryption, buddy”. Sure thing. How about the metadata attached to that encrypted gibberish nobody is really interested in? To show you how unavoidable the concept of metadata is, even Signal developed by the Signal Foundation which is considered the truly end-to-end and open source protocol for confidential information exchange, can see metadata. At Signal they claim they just don’t keep it, as they also state in the Signal’s privacy policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
"Certain information (e.g. a recipient's identifier, an encrypted message body, etc.) is transmitted to us solely for the purpose of placing calls or transmitting messages. Unless otherwise stated below, this information is only kept as long as necessary to place each call or transmit each message, and is not used for any other purpose." <br>
This is one of those issues that shall be solved with legislation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But like money laundering, your data is caught in a storm of transactions so intricate that at a certain point, how do you even check...<br>
All participating companies share customer data with each other (a process called value exchange). They let marketers utilize the data, for example to target people after they have searched for flights or hotels. Adara creates audience segments and sells them, for example to Google, for advertisement targeting. The consumer data broker LiveRamp for example lists Adara as a data provider. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: consumer data broker. I am starting to get what you mean when you say that we are for sale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Let’s talk about LiveRamp, part of Acxiom. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: there they go... Acxiom... I heard of them </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
They self-describe as an “Identity Resolution Platform”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: I mean, George Orwell would be proud. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Their mission? <em>“To connect offline data and online data back to a single identifier”. In other words, clients can “resolve all” of their “offline and online identifiers back to the individual consumer”. </em><br>
Various digital profiles, like the ones generated on social media or when you visit a website, are matched to databases which contains names, postal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, geo locations and IP addresses, online and mobile identifiers, such as cookie and device IDs. <br>
<br>
F: well, all this stuff is possible if and only if someone gets in possession of all these profiles, or well... they purchase them. Still, what the f**k. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
A cute example? Imagine you register on any random website but you don’t want to give them your home address. They just buy it from LiveRamp, which gets it from your phone geolocation data - which is for sale. Where does your phone sit still for 12 hours every night? That’s your home address. Easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: And they definitely know how much time do I spend at the gym, without even checking my Instagram! Ok this is another level of creepy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
Clients of LiveRamp can upload their own consumer data to the platform, combine it with data from hundreds of 100 third-party data providers, and then utilize it on more than 500 marketing technology platforms. They can use this data to find and target people with specific characteristics, to recognize and track consumers <em>across devices and platforms</em>, to profile and categorize them, to personalize content for them, and to measure how they behave. For example, clients could “recognize a website visitor” and “provide a customized offer” based on extensive profile data, <em>without requiring said user to log in to the website.</em> Furthermore, LiveRamp has a data store, for other companies to “buy and sell valuable customer data”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: What is even the point of giving me the choice to consent to anything online?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
In short, there is no point. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F: it seems we are so behind with regulations on data sharing. GDPR is not cutting it, not really. With programmatic advertising we have created a monster that has really grown out of control. <br>
So: our lives are completely transparent to private corporations, that constantly surveil us en-masse, and exploit all of our data to sell us shit. How does this affect our freedom? How about we just don’t buy it? Can it be that simple? And I would not take a no for an answer here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
F:  oh crap!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m going to read you a passage from Permanent Record:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Who among us can predict the future? Who would dare to? <br>
The answer to the first question is no one, really, and the answer to the second is everyone, especially every government and business on the planet. This is what that data of ours is used for. Algorithms analyze it for patterns of established behaviour in order to extrapolate behaviours to come, a type of digital prophecy that’s only slightly more accurate that analog methods like palm reading. Once you go digging into the actual technical mechanisms by which predictability is calculated, you come to understand that its science is, in fact, anti-scientific, and fatally misnamed: predictability is actually manipulation. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><br>
A website that tells you that because you liked book 1 then you might also like book 2, isn’t offering an educated guess as much as a mechanism of subtle coercion. We can’t allow ourselves to be used in this way, to be used against the future. We can’t permit our data to be used to sell us the very things that must not be sold, such as journalism. [....]</em> <br>
<em>We can’t let the god-like surveillance we’re under be used to “calculate” our citizenship scores, or to “predict” our criminal activity; to tell us what kind of education we can have, or what kind of job we can have [...], to discriminate against us based on our financial, legal, and medical histories, not to mention our ethnicity or race, which are constructs that data often assumes or imposes. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><br>
[...] if we allow [our data] to be used to identify us, then it will be used to victimize us, even to modify us - to remake the very essence of our humanity in the image of the technology that seeks its control. Of course, all of the above has already happened. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: In other words, we are surveilled and our data collected, and used to affect every aspect of our lives - what we read, what movies we watch, where we travel, what we buy, who we date, what we study, where we work… This is a self-fulfilling prophecy for all of humanity, and the prophet is a stupid, imperfect algorithm optimised just to make money. <br>
So I guess my message of today for all Data Scientists out there is this: just… don't. </p>

Episode transcript
We always hear the word “metadata”, usually in a sentence that goes like this
 

Your Honor, I swear, we were not collecting users data, just metadata.

 
Usually the guy saying this sentence is Zuckerberg, but could be anybody from Amazon or Google. “Just” metadata, so no problem. This is one of the biggest lies about the reality of data collection.
 
F: Ok the first question is, what the hell is metadata? 
 
Metadata is data about data. 
 
F: Ok… still not clear.Imagine you make a phone call to your mum. How often do you call your mum, Francesco?F: Every day of course! (coughing)
 
Good boy! Ok, so let’s talk about today’s phone call. Let’s call “data” the stuff that you and your mum actually said. What did you talk about? 
 
F: She was giving me the recipe for her famous lasagna. 
So your mum’s lasagna is the DATA. What is the metadata of this phone call? The lasagna has data of its own attached to it: the date and time when the conversation happened, the duration of the call, the unique hardware identifiers of your phone and your mum’s phone, the identifiers of the two sim cards, the location of the cell towers that pinged the call, the GPS coordinates of the phones themselves. 
 
F: yeah well, this lasagna comes with a lot of data :) 
And this is assuming that this data is not linked to any other data like your Facebook account or your web browsing history. More of that later. 
 
F: Whoa Whoa Whoa, ok. Let’s put a pin in that. Going back to the “basic” metadata that you describe. I think we understand the concept of data about data. I am sure you did your research and you would love to paint me a dystopian nightmare, as always. Tell us why is this a big deal? 
 
Metadata is a very big deal. In fact, metadata is far more “useful” than the actual data, where by “useful” I mean that it allows a third party to learn about you and your whole life. What I am saying is, the fact that you talk with your mum every day for 15 minutes is telling me more about you than the content of the actual conversations. In a way, the content does not matter. Only the metadata matters. 
 
F: Ok, can you explain this point a bit more? 
 
Imagine this scenario: you work in an office in Brussels, and you go by car. Every day, you use your time in the car while you go home to call your mum. So every day around 6pm, a cell tower along the path from your office to your home pings a call from your phone to your mum’s phone. Someone who is looking at your metadata, knows exactly where you are while you call your mum. Every day you will talk about something different, and it doesn't really matter.  Your location will come through loud and clear. A lot of additional information can be deduced from this too: for example, you are moving along a motorway, therefore you have a car. The metadata of a call to mum now becomes information on where you are at 6pm, and the way you travel. 
 
F: I see. So metadata about the phone call is, in fact, real data about me. 
 
Exactly. YOU are what is interesting, not your mum’s lasagna.
 
F: you say so because you haven’t tried my mum’s lasagna. But I totally get your point.
 
Now, imagine that one day, instead of going straight home, you decide to go somewhere else. Maybe you are secretly looking for another job. Your metadata is recording the fact that after work you visit the offices of a rival company. Maybe you are a journalist and you visit your anonymous source. Your metadata records wherever you go, and one of these places is your secret meeting with your source. Anyone’s metadata can be combined with yours. There will be someone who was with you at the time and place of your secret meeting. Anyone who comes in contact with you can be tagged and monitored. Now their anonymity has been reduced. 
 
F: I get it. So, compared to the content of my c]]></itunes:summary>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In 2017 a research group at the University of Washington did a study on the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter. They constructed what they call a “shared audience graph” to analyse the different groups of audiences participating in the debate, and found an alignment of the groups with the political left and political right, as well as clear alignments with groups participating in other debates, like environmental issues, abortion issues and so on. In simple terms, someone who is pro-environment, pro-abortion, left-leaning, is also supportive of the <a href='https://blacklivesmatter.com/'>Black Lives Matter</a> movement, and viceversa.</p>
F: Ok, this seems to make sense, right? But… I suspect there is more to this story?
<p>So far, yes…. What they did not expect to find, though, was a pervasive network of Russian accounts participating in the debate, which turned out to be orchestrated by the Internet Research Agency, the not-so-secret Russian secret service agency of internet black ops. The same connected with the US election and Brexit referendum, allegedly. </p>
F: Are we talking about actual spies? Where are you going with this?
<p>Basically, the Russian accounts (part of them human and part of them bots) were infiltrating all aspects of the debate, both on the left and on the right side, and always taking the most extreme stances on any particular aspect of the debate. The aim was to radicalise the conversation, to make it more and more extreme, in a tactic of divide-and-conquer: turn the population against itself in an online civil war, push for policies that normally would be considered too extreme (for instance, give tanks to the police to control riots, force a curfew, try to ban Muslims from your country). Chaos and unrest have repercussions on international trade and relations, and can align to foreign interests.</p>
F: It seems like a pretty indirect and convoluted way of influencing a foreign power…
<p>You might think so, but you are forgetting social media. This sort of operation is directly exploiting a core feature of internet social media platforms. And that feature, I am afraid, is recommender systems.</p>
F: Whoa. Let’s take a step back. Let’s recap the general features of recommender systems, so we are on the same page. 
<p>The main purpose of recommender systems is to recommend people the same items similar people show an interest in.
Let’s think about books and readers. The general idea is to find a way to predict the best book to the best reader. Amazon is doing it, Netflix is doing it, probably the bookstore down the road does that too, just on a smaller scale.
Some of the most common methods to implement recommender systems, use concepts such as cosine/correlation similarity, matrix factorization, neural autoencoders and sequence predictors.</p>
<p>The major issue of recommender systems is in their validation. Even though validation occurs in a way that is similar to many machine learning methods, one should recommend a set of items first (in production) and measure the efficacy of such a recommendation. But, recommending is already altering the entire scenario, a bit in the flavour of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle'>Heisenberg principle of uncertainty</a>. </p>
F: In the attention economy, the business model is to monetise the time the user spends on a platform, by showing them ads. Recommender systems are crucial for this purpose.
Chiara, you are saying that these algorithms have effects that are problematic?
<p>As you say, recommender systems exist because the business model of social media platforms is to monetise attention. The most effective way to keep users’ attention is to show them stuff they could show an interest in.
In order to do that, one must segment the audience to find the best content for each user. But then, for each user, how do you keep them engaged, and make them consume more content? </p>
F: You’re going to say the word “filter bubble” very soon.
<p>Spot on. To keep the user on the platform, you start by showing them content that they are interested in, and that agrees with their opinion. </p>
<p>But that is not all. How many videos of the same stuff can you watch, how many articles can you read? You must also escalate the content that the user sees, increasing the wow factor. The content goes from mild to extreme (conspiracy theories, hate speech etc).</p>
<p>The recommended content pushes the user opinion towards more extreme stances. It is hard to see from inside the bubble, but a simple experiment will show it. If you continue to click the first recommended video on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/'>YouTube</a>, and you follow the chain of first recommended videos, soon you will find yourself watching stuff you’d never have actively looked for, like conspiracy theories, or alt-right propaganda (or pranks that get progressively more cruel, videos by people committing suicide, and so on).</p>
F: So you are saying that this is not an accident: is this the basis of the optimisation of the recommender system? 
<p>Yes, and it’s very effective. But obviously there are consequences. </p>
F: And I’m guessing they are not good. 
<p>The collective result of single users being pushed toward more radical stances is a radicalisation of the whole conversation, the disappearance of nuances in the argument, the trivialisation of complex issues. For example, the Brexit debate in 2016 was about trade deals and custom unions, and now it is about remain vs no deal, with almost nothing in between. </p>
F: Yes, the conversation is getting stupider. Is this just a giant accident? Just a sensible system that got out of control?
<p>Yes and no. Recommender systems originate as a tool for boosting commercial revenue, by selling more products. But applied to social media, they have caused an aberration: the recommendation of information, which leads to the so-called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble'>filter bubbles</a>, the rise of fake news and disinformation, and the manipulation of the masses. </p>
<p>There is an intense debate in the scientific community about the polarising effects of the internet and social media on the population. An example of such study is a paper by Johnson et al. It predicts that whether and how a population becomes polarised is dictated by the nature of the underlying competition, rather than the validity of the information that individuals receive or their online bubbles. </p>
F: I would like to stress on this finding. This is really f*cked up. Polarisation is not caused by the particular subject nor the way a debate is conducted. But by how legitimate the information seems to the single person. Which means that if I find a way to convince the single individuals about something, I will be in fact manipulating the debate at a community scale or, in some cases, globally!
Oh my god we seem to be so f*cked.
<p>Take for instance the people who believe that the Earth is flat. Or the time it took people to recognise global warming as scientific, despite the fact that, the threshold for scientific confirmation was reached decades ago.</p>
F: So, recommender systems let loose on social media platforms amplify controversy and conflict, and fringe opinions. I know I’m not going to like the answer, but I’m going to ask the question anyway.
This is all just an innocent mistake, right? 
<p>Last year, the European Data Protection Supervisor has published a report on online manipulation at scale. </p>
F: That does not sound good.
<p>The online digital ecosystem has connected people across the world with over 50% of the population on the Internet, albeit very unevenly in terms of geography, wealth and gender. The initial optimism about the potential of internet tools and social media for civic engagement has given way to concern that people are being manipulated. This happens through the combination of constant harvesting of often intimate information about them, and the control over the information they see online according to the category they are put into (so called segmentation of the audience). Arguably since 2016, but probably before, mass manipulation at scale has occurred during democratic elections. By using algorithms to game recommender systems, among other things, to spread misinformation. Remember Cambridge Analytica? </p>
F: I remember. I wish I didn’t. But why does it work? Are we so easy to manipulate? 
<p>An interesting point is this. When one receives information collectively, as for example from the television news, it is far less likely that she develops extreme views (like, the Earth is flat), because she would base the discourse on a common understanding of reality. And people call out each other’s bulls*it. </p>
F: Fair enough.
<p>
But when one receives information singularly, like what happens via a recommender system through micro-targeting, then reality has a different manifestation for each audience member, with no common ground. It is far more likely to adopt extreme views, because there is no way to fact check, and because the news feel personal. In fact, they tailor such news are to the users to push their buttons.
Francesco, if you show me George Clooney shirtless and holding a puppy, and George tells me that the Earth is flat, I might have doubts for a minute. Too personal? </p>
F: That’s good to know about you. I’m more of a cat person. But, experts keep saying that we are moving towards personalisation of everything. While this makes sense for things like personalised medicine, it probably is not that beneficial with many other kinds of recommendations. Especially not the news.
But social media feeds are extremely personalised. What can we do? 
<p>Solutions have focused on transparency measures, exposing the source of information while neglecting the accountability of players in the ecosystem who profit from harmful behaviour. But these are band aids on bullet wounds.
The problem is the social media platforms. In October 2019 Zuckerberg was in front of congress again, because Facebook refuses to fact-check political advertisements, in 2019, after everything that’s happened. At the same time market concentration and the rise of platform dominance threatens media pluralism. This in turn, is leading to repeat and amplify a handful of news pieces and to silence independent journalism. </p>
F: When I think of a recommender system, I think of Netflix.
<ul><li>You liked this kind of show in the past, so here are more shows of the same genre</li>
<li>People like you have liked this other type of show. Hence, here it is for your consideration</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems relatively benign. Although, if you think some more, you realise that this mechanism will prevent you from actually discovering anything new. It just gives you more of what you are likely to like. But one would not think that this would have world-changing consequences. 
If you think of the news, this mechanism becomes lethal: in the mildest form – which is already bad – you will only hear opinions that already align with those of your own peer group. In the worst scenario, you will not hear some news at all, or you will hear a misleading or false version of the news, and you don’t even know that a different version exists.</p>
<p>In the Brexit referendum, misleading or false content (like the famous NHS money that supposedly was going to the EU instead) has been amplified in filter bubbles. Each bubble of people was essentially understanding a different version of the same issue. Brexit was a million different things, depending on your social media feeds.
And of course, there are malicious players in the game, like the russian Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica, who actively exploited this features in order to swing the vote. </p>
F: Even the traditional media is starting to adopt recommender systems for the news content. This seems like a very bad idea, after all. Is there any other scenario in which recommender systems are not great? 
<p>Researchers use recommender systems in a variety of applications.
For instance, in the job market. A recommender system limits exposure to certain information about jobs on the basis of the person’s gender or inferred health status, and therefore it perpetuates discriminatory attitudes and practices. In the US, researchers use recommender systems to calculate the bail fee for people who have been arrested, disproportionately penalising people of colour. This has to do with the training of the algorithm. In an already unequal system (where for instance there are few women in top managerial positions, and more African-Americans in jail than white Americans) a recommender system will by design amplify such inequality. </p>
F: Recommender systems are part of the problem, and they make everything worse. But the origin of the problem lies somewhere else, I suspect. 
<p>Yep. The problem with recommender systems goes even deeper. I would rather connect it to the problem of privacy. A recommender system only works if it knows its audience. They are so powerful, because they know everything about us. 
We don’t have any privacy anymore. Online players know exactly who we are, our lives are transparent to both corporations and governments. For an excellent analysis of this, read Snowden’s book “<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Record-Edward-Snowden/dp/1250237238'>Permanent Record</a>”. I highly recommend it. </p>
F: The pun was intended wasn’t it?
<p>With all this information about us, we are put into “categories” for specific purposes: selling us products, influencing our vote. They target us with ads aimed at our specific category, and this generates more discussion and more content on our social media. Recommender systems amplify the targeting by design. They would be much less effective, and much less dangerous, in a world where our lives are private. </p>
F: Social media platforms base their whole business model in “knowing us”. The business model itself is problematic. 
<p>As we said in the <a href='https://datascienceathome.com/the-dark-side-of-ai-social-media-and-the-optimization-of-addiction/'>previous episode</a>, the internet has become centralised, with a handful of platforms controlling most of the traffic. In some countries like Myanmar, internet access itself is provided and controlled by Facebook. </p>
F: Chiara, where’s Myanmar?
<p>In South-East Asia, between India and Thailand.
In effect, the forum for public discourse and the available space for freedom of speech is now bounded by the profit motives of powerful private companies. Due to technical complexity or on the grounds of commercial secrecy, such companies decline to explain how decisions are made. Mostly, they make decisions via recommender algorithms, which amplify bias and segregation. And at the same time the few major platforms with their extraordinary reach offer an easy target for people seeking to use the system for malicious ends. </p>
Conclusion
<p>This is our call to all data scientists out there. Be aware of personalisation in building recommender systems. Personalising is not always beneficial. There are a few cases where it is, e.g. medicine, genetics, drug discovery. Many other cases where it is detrimental e.g. news, consumer products/services, opinions.
Personalisation by algorithm, and in particular of the news, leads to a fragmentation of reality that undermines democracy. Collectively we need to push for reigning in targeted advertising, and the path to this leads to more strict rules on privacy. As long as we are completely transparent to commercial and governmental players, like we are today, we are vulnerable to lies, misdirection and manipulation.
As Christopher Wylie (the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower) eloquently said, it’s like going on a date, where you know nothing about the other person, but they know absolutely everything about you.
We are left without agency, and without real choice.
In other words, we are f*cked</p>

They constructed what they call a <em>“shared audience graph”</em> to analyse the different groups of audiences participating in the debate, and found an alignment of the groups with the political left and political right, as well as clear alignments with groups participating in other debates, like environmental issues, abortion issues and so on. In simple terms, someone who is pro-environment, pro-abortion, left-leaning, is also supportive of the <a href='https://blacklivesmatter.com/'>Black Lives Matter</a> movement, and viceversa.</p>
F: Ok, this seems to make sense, right? But… I suspect there is more to this story?
<p>So far, yes…. What they did not expect to find, though, was a pervasive network of Russian accounts participating in the debate, which turned out to be orchestrated by the Internet Research Agency, the not-so-secret Russian secret service agency of internet black ops. The same connected with the US election and Brexit referendum, allegedly. </p>
F: Are we talking about actual spies? Where are you going with this?
<p>Basically, the Russian accounts (part of them human and part of them bots) were infiltrating all aspects of the debate, both on the left and on the right side, and always taking the most extreme stances on any particular aspect of the debate. The aim was to radicalise the conversation, to make it more and more extreme, in a tactic of divide-and-conquer: turn the population against itself in an online civil war, push for policies that normally would be considered too extreme (for instance, give tanks to the police to control riots, force a curfew, try to ban Muslims from your country). Chaos and unrest have repercussions on international trade and relations, and can align to foreign interests.</p>
F: It seems like a pretty indirect and convoluted way of influencing a foreign power…
<p>You might think so, but you are forgetting social media. This sort of operation is directly exploiting a core feature of internet social media platforms. And that feature, I am afraid, is recommender systems.</p>
F: Whoa. Let’s take a step back. Let’s recap the general features of recommender systems, so we are on the same page. 
<p>The main purpose of recommender systems is to recommend people the same items similar people show an interest in.<br>
Let’s think about books and readers. The general idea is to find a way to predict the best book to the best reader. Amazon is doing it, Netflix is doing it, probably the bookstore down the road does that too, just on a smaller scale.<br>
Some of the most common methods to implement recommender systems, use concepts such as cosine/correlation similarity, matrix factorization, neural autoencoders and sequence predictors.</p>
<p>The major issue of recommender systems is in their validation. Even though validation occurs in a way that is similar to many machine learning methods, one should recommend a set of items first (in production) and measure the efficacy of such a recommendation. But, recommending is already altering the entire scenario, a bit in the flavour of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle'>Heisenberg principle of uncertainty</a>. </p>
F: In the attention economy, the business model is to monetise the time the user spends on a platform, by showing them ads. Recommender systems are crucial for this purpose.<br>
Chiara, you are saying that these algorithms have effects that are problematic?
<p>As you say, recommender systems exist because the business model of social media platforms is to monetise attention. The most effective way to keep users’ attention is to show them stuff they could show an interest in.<br>
In order to do that, one must segment the audience to find the best content for each user. But then, for each user, how do you keep them engaged, and make them consume more content? </p>
F: You’re going to say the word “filter bubble” very soon.
<p>Spot on. To keep the user on the platform, you start by showing them content that they are interested in, and that agrees with their opinion. </p>
<p>But that is not all. How many videos of the same stuff can you watch, how many articles can you read? You must also escalate the content that the user sees, increasing the wow factor. The content goes from mild to extreme (conspiracy theories, hate speech etc).</p>
<p>The recommended content pushes the user opinion towards more extreme stances. It is hard to see from inside the bubble, but a simple experiment will show it. If you continue to click the first recommended video on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/'>YouTube</a>, and you follow the chain of first recommended videos, soon you will find yourself watching stuff you’d never have actively looked for, like conspiracy theories, or alt-right propaganda (or pranks that get progressively more cruel, videos by people committing suicide, and so on).</p>
F: So you are saying that this is not an accident: is this the basis of the optimisation of the recommender system? 
<p>Yes, and it’s very effective. But obviously there are consequences. </p>
F: And I’m guessing they are not good. 
<p>The collective result of single users being pushed toward more radical stances is a radicalisation of the whole conversation, the disappearance of nuances in the argument, the trivialisation of complex issues. For example, the Brexit debate in 2016 was about trade deals and custom unions, and now it is about remain vs no deal, with almost nothing in between. </p>
F: Yes, the conversation is getting stupider. Is this just a giant accident? Just a sensible system that got out of control?
<p>Yes and no. Recommender systems originate as a tool for boosting commercial revenue, by selling more products. But applied to social media, they have caused an aberration: the recommendation of information, which leads to the so-called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble'>filter bubbles</a>, the rise of fake news and disinformation, and the manipulation of the masses. </p>
<p>There is an intense debate in the scientific community about the polarising effects of the internet and social media on the population. An example of such study is a paper by Johnson et al. It predicts that whether and how a population becomes polarised is dictated by the nature of the underlying competition, rather than the validity of the information that individuals receive or their online <em>bubbles</em>. </p>
F: I would like to stress on this finding. This is really f*cked up. Polarisation is not caused by the particular subject nor the way a debate is conducted. But by how legitimate the information seems to the single person. Which means that if I find a way to convince the single individuals about something, I will be in fact manipulating the debate at a community scale or, in some cases, globally!<br>
Oh my god we seem to be so f*cked.
<p>Take for instance the people who believe that the Earth is flat. Or the time it took people to recognise global warming as scientific, despite the fact that, the threshold for scientific confirmation was reached decades ago.</p>
F: So, recommender systems let loose on social media platforms amplify controversy and conflict, and fringe opinions. I know I’m not going to like the answer, but I’m going to ask the question anyway.<br>
This is all just an innocent mistake, right? 
<p>Last year, the European Data Protection Supervisor has published a report on online manipulation at scale. </p>
F: That does not sound good.
<p>The online digital ecosystem has connected people across the world with over 50% of the population on the Internet, albeit very unevenly in terms of geography, wealth and gender. The initial optimism about the potential of internet tools and social media for civic engagement has given way to concern that people are being manipulated. This happens through the combination of constant harvesting of often intimate information about them, and the control over the information they see online according to the category they are put into (so called segmentation of the audience). Arguably since 2016, but probably before, mass manipulation at scale has occurred during democratic elections. By using algorithms to game recommender systems, among other things, to spread misinformation. Remember Cambridge Analytica? </p>
F: I remember. I wish I didn’t. But why does it work? Are we so easy to manipulate? 
<p>An interesting point is this. When one receives information collectively, as for example from the television news, it is far less likely that she develops extreme views (like, the Earth is flat), because she would base the discourse on a common understanding of reality. And people call out each other’s bulls*it. </p>
F: Fair enough.
<p><br>
But when one receives information singularly, like what happens via a recommender system through micro-targeting, then reality has a different manifestation for each audience member, with no common ground. It is far more likely to adopt extreme views, because there is no way to fact check, and because the news <em>feel personal</em>. In fact, they tailor such news are to the users to push their buttons.<br>
Francesco, if you show me George Clooney shirtless and holding a puppy, and George tells me that the Earth is flat, I might have doubts for a minute. Too personal? </p>
F: That’s good to know about you. I’m more of a cat person. But, experts keep saying that we are moving towards personalisation of everything. While this makes sense for things like personalised medicine, it probably is not that beneficial with many other kinds of recommendations. Especially not the news.<br>
But social media feeds are extremely personalised. What can we do? 
<p>Solutions have focused on transparency measures, exposing the source of information while neglecting the accountability of players in the ecosystem who profit from harmful behaviour. But these are band aids on bullet wounds.<br>
The problem is the social media platforms. In October 2019 Zuckerberg was in front of congress again, because Facebook refuses to fact-check political advertisements, in 2019, after everything that’s happened. At the same time market concentration and the rise of platform dominance threatens media pluralism. This in turn, is leading to repeat and amplify a handful of news pieces and to silence independent journalism. </p>
F: When I think of a recommender system, I think of Netflix.
<ul><li>You liked this kind of show in the past, so here are more shows of the same genre</li>
<li>People like you have liked this other type of show. Hence, here it is for your consideration</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems relatively benign. Although, if you think some more, you realise that this mechanism will prevent you from actually discovering anything new. It just gives you more of what you are likely to like. But one would not think that this would have world-changing consequences. <br>
If you think of the news, this mechanism becomes lethal: in the mildest form – which is already bad – you will only hear opinions that already align with those of your own peer group. In the worst scenario, you will not hear some news at all, or you will hear a misleading or false version of the news, and you don’t even know that a different version exists.</p>
<p>In the Brexit referendum, misleading or false content (like the famous NHS money that supposedly was going to the EU instead) has been amplified in filter bubbles. Each bubble of people was essentially understanding a different version of the same issue. Brexit was a million different things, depending on your social media feeds.<br>
And of course, there are malicious players in the game, like the russian Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica, who actively exploited this features in order to swing the vote. </p>
F: Even the traditional media is starting to adopt recommender systems for the news content. This seems like a very bad idea, after all. Is there any other scenario in which recommender systems are not great? 
<p>Researchers use recommender systems in a variety of applications.<br>
For instance, in the job market. A recommender system limits exposure to certain information about jobs on the basis of the person’s gender or inferred health status, and therefore it perpetuates discriminatory attitudes and practices. In the US, researchers use recommender systems to calculate the bail fee for people who have been arrested, disproportionately penalising people of colour. This has to do with the training of the algorithm. In an already unequal system (where for instance there are few women in top managerial positions, and more African-Americans in jail than white Americans) a recommender system will by design amplify such inequality. </p>
F: Recommender systems are part of the problem, and they make everything worse. But the origin of the problem lies somewhere else, I suspect. 
<p>Yep. The problem with recommender systems goes even deeper. I would rather connect it to the problem of <em>privacy</em>. A recommender system only works if it knows its audience. They are so powerful, because they know everything about us. <br>

“I feel tremendous guilt. The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works ”.</p>

<p>F: how many times do you check your Facebook in a day?</p>
<p>I am not a fan of Facebook. I do not have it on my phone.  Still, I check it in the morning on my laptop, and maybe twice more per day. I have a trick though: I do not scroll down. I only check the top bar to see if someone has invited me to an event, or contacted me directly. But from time to time, this resolution of mine slips, and I catch myself scrolling down, without even realising it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: is it the first thing you check when you wake up?</p>
<p>No because usually I have a message from you!! :) But yes, while I have my coffee I do a sweep on Facebook and twitter and maybe Instagram, plus the news.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Check how much time you spend on Facebook</p>
<p>And then sum it up to your email, twitter, reddit, youtube, instagram, etc. (all viable channels for ads to reach you)</p>
<p>We have an answer. More on that later. 
Clearly in this episode there is some form of addiction we would like to talk about. So let’s start from the beginning: how does addiction work?</p>
<p>Dopamine is a hormone produced by our body, and in the brain it works as a neurotransmitter, a chemical that neurons use to transmit signals to each other. One of the main functions of dopamine is to shape the “reward-motivated behaviour”: this is the way our brain learns through association, positive reinforcement, incentives, and positively-valenced emotions, in particular, pleasure. In other words, it makes our brain desire more of the things that make us feel good. These things can be for example good food, sex, and crucially, good social interactions, like hugging your friends or your baby, or having a laugh together. Because we are evolved to be social animals with complex social structures, successful social interactions are an evolutionary advantage, and therefore they trigger dopamine release in our brain, which makes us feel good, and reinforces the association between the action and the reward. This feeling motivates us to repeat the behaviour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: now that you mention reinforcement, I recall that this mechanism is so powerful and effective that in fact we have been inspired by nature and replicated it in-silico with reinforcement learning. The idea is to motivate (and eventually create an addictive pattern) an agent to follow what is called the optimal policy by giving it positive rewards or punishing it when things don’t go the way we planned. </p>
<p>In our brain, every time an action produces a reward, the connection between action and reward becomes stronger. Through reinforcement, a baby learns to distinguish a cat from a dog, or that fire hurts (that was me).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: and so this means that all the social interactions people get from social media platforms are in fact doing the same, right? </p>
<p>Yes, but with a difference: smartphones in our pockets keep us connected to an unlimited reserve of constant social interactions. This constant flux of notifications - the rewards - flood our brain with dopamine. The mechanism of reinforcement can spin out of control. The reward pathways in our brain can malfunction, and this leads to addiction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: you are saying that social media has LITERALLY the effect of a drug? </p>
<p>Yes. In fact, social media platforms are DESIGNED to exploit the rewards systems in our brain. They are designed to work like a drug. 
Have you been to a casino and played roulette or the slot machines? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: ...maybe?</p>
<p>Why is it fun to play roulette? The fun comes from the WAIT before the reward. You put a chip on a number, you don’t know how it’s going to go. You wait for the ball to spin, you get excited. And from time to time, BAM! Your number comes out. Now, compare this with posting something on facebook. You write a message into the void, wait…. And then the LIKES start coming in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F:  yeah i find that familiar... </p>
<p>Contrary to the casino, social media platforms do not want our money, in fact they are free. What they want is, and what we are buying into with, is our time. Because the longer we stay on, the longer they can show us ads, and the more money advertisers can pay them. This is no accident, this is the business model. But asking for our time out loud would not work, we would probably not consciously give it to them. So, like a casino, they make it hard for us to get off, once we are on: they make us crave the likes, the right-swipes, the retweets, the subscriptions. So we check in, we stay on, we keep scrolling, because we hope to get those rewards. The short-term satisfaction of getting a “like” is a little boost of dopamine in our brain. We get used to it, and we want more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: a lot of machine learning is also being deployed to amplify this form of addiction and make it.... Well more addictive :) But the question is: how such powerful ads and scenarios are so effective because of the algorithms and how much just because humans are just wired to obey such dynamics? My question is: are we essentially flawed or are these algorithms truly powerful? </p>
<p>It is not a flaw, it’s a feature. The way our brain has evolved has been in response to very specific needs. In particular for this conversation, our brain is wired to favour social interactions, because it is an evolutionary advantage. These algorithms exploit these features of the brain on purpose, they are designed to exploit them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: I believe so, but I also believe that the human brain is a powerful machine, so it should be able to predict what satisfaction it can get from social media. So how does it happen that we become addicted?</p>
<p>An example of optimisation strategy that social media platforms use is based on the principle of “reward prediction error coding”. Our brain learns to find patterns in data - this is a basic survival skill - and therefore learns when to expect a reward for a given set of actions. I eat cake, therefore I am happy. Every time. 
Imagine a scenario, where we have learnt through experience that when we play slot machines in a casino, we learn that we win some money once every 100 times we pull the lever. The difference between predicted and received rewards is a known, fixed quantity. If so, just after winning once, we have almost zero incentive to play again. So the casino fixes the slot machines, to introduce a random element to the timing of the reward. Suddenly our prediction error increases substantially. In this margin of error, in the time between the action (pull the lever) and the reward (maybe) our brain has time to make us anticipate the result and make us excited at the possibility, and this releases dopamine. Playing in itself becomes a reward. 

F: There is an equivalent in reinforcement learning called the grid world which consists in a mouse getting to the cheese in a maze. In reinforcement learning, everything works smooth as long as the cheese stays in the same place.</p>
<p>Exactly! Now social media apps implement an equivalent trick, called “variable reward schedules”.</p>
<p>In our brain, after an action we get a reward or punishment, and we generate positive or negative feedback to that action. 
Social media apps optimise their algorithms for the ideal balance of negative and positive feedback  in our brains caused by the difference between these predicted and received rewards. </p>
<p>If we perceive a reward to be delivered at random, and - crucially - if checking for the reward comes at little cost, like opening the Facebook app, we end up checking for rewards all the time. Every time we are just a little bit bored, without even thinking, we check the app. The Facebook reward system (the schedule and triggers of notification and likes) has been optimised to maximise this behaviour. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: are you saying that buffering some likes and then finding the right moment to show them to the user can make the user crave for reward? </p>
<p>Oh yes. Instagram will withhold likes for a period of time, causing a dip in reward compared to the expected level. It will then deliver them later in larger bundles, thus boosting the reward above the expected value, which trigger extra dopamine release, which sends us on a high akin to a cocaine hit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: Dear audience, do you remember my question? How much time do each of you spend on social media (or similar) in a day? And why do we still do it?</p>
<p>The fundamental feature here is how little is the perceived cost to check for the reward: I just need to open the app. We perceive this cost to be minimal, so we don’t even think about it. YouTube for instance had the autoplay feature, so you need to do absolutely nothing to remain on the app. But the cost is cumulative over time, it becomes hours in our day, days in a month, years in our lives!! 2 hours of social media per day amounts to 1 month per year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>F: But it’s so EASY, it has become so natural to use social media for everything. To use Google for everything.</p>
<p>The convenience that the platforms give us is one of the most dangerous things about them, and not only for our individual life. The convenience of reaching so many users, together with the business model of monetising attention is one of the causes of the centralisation of the internet, i.e. the fact a few giant platforms control most of the internet traffic. Revenue from ads is concentrated on big platforms, and content creators have no other choice but to use them, if they want to be competitive. The internet went from looking like a distributed network to a centralised network. And this in turn causes data to be centralised, in a self-reinforcing loop. Most of human conversations and interactions pass through the servers of a handful of private corporations.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>As Data scientists we should be aware of this (and we think mostly we are). We should also be ethically responsible. I think that being a data scientist no longer has a neutral connotation. Algorithms have this huge power of manipulating human behaviour, and let’s be honest, we are the only ones who really understand how they work. So we have a responsibility here. </p>
<p>There are some organisations, like Data For Democracy for example, who are advocating for something equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath for data scientists. Do no harm.  </p>

<p>I am not a fan of Facebook. I do not have it on my phone.  Still, I check it in the morning on my laptop, and maybe twice more per day. I have a trick though: I do not scroll down.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Some of the most powerful NLP models like BERT and GPT-2 have one thing in common: they all use the transformer architecture. Such architecture is built on top of another important concept already known to the community: self-attention.In this episode I explain what these mechanisms are, how they work and why they are so powerful.

More specifically, GANs suffer of three major issues such as instability of the training procedure, mode collapse and vanishing gradients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this episode I not only explain the most challenging issues one would encounter while designing and training Generative Adversarial Networks. But also some methods and architectures to mitigate them. In addition I elucidate the three specific strategies that researchers are considering to improve the accuracy and the reliability of GANs.</p>
<p> </p>
The most tedious issues of GANs
<p> </p>
Convergence to equilibrium
<p> </p>
<p>A typical GAN is formed by at least two networks: a generator G and a discriminator D. The generator's task is to generate samples from random noise. In turn, the discriminator has to learn to distinguish fake samples from real ones. While it is theoretically possible that generators and discriminators converge to a Nash Equilibrium (at which both networks are in their optimal state), reaching such equilibrium is not easy. </p>
<p> </p>
Vanishing gradients
<p> </p>
<p>Moreover, a very accurate discriminator would push the loss function towards lower and lower values. This in turn, might cause the gradient to vanish and the entire network to stop learning completely. </p>
<p> </p>
Mode collapse
<p> </p>
<p>Another phenomenon that is easy to observe when dealing with GANs is mode collapse. That is the incapability of the model to generate diverse samples. This in turn, leads to generated data that are more and more similar to the previous ones. Hence, the entire generated dataset would be just concentrated around a particular statistical value. </p>
<p> </p>
The solution
<p> </p>
<p>Researchers have taken into consideration several approaches to overcome such issues. They have been playing with architectural changes, different loss functions and game theory.</p>

<p>Today’s episode will be about memorisation and generalisation in deep learning, with <a href='https://kudkudak.github.io/'>Stanislaw Jastrzębski</a> from New York University.</p>
<p>Stan spent two summers as a visiting student with <a href='http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/index.html'>Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a> and has been working on </p>
<ul><li style="font-weight:400;">Understanding and improving how deep network generalise</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
What makes deep learning unique?
<p>I have asked him a few questions for which I was looking for an answer for a long time. For instance, what is deep learning bringing to the table that other methods don’t or are not capable of? 
Stan believe that the one thing that makes deep learning special is representation learning. All the other competing methods, be it kernel machines, or random forests, do not have this capability. Moreover, optimisation (SGD) lies at the heart of representation learning in the sense that it allows finding good representations. </p>
<p> </p>
What really improves the training quality of a neural network?
<p>We discussed about the accuracy of neural networks depending pretty much on how good the Stochastic Gradient Descent method is at finding minima of the loss function. What would influence such minima?
Stan's answer has revealed that training set accuracy or loss value is not that interesting actually. It is relatively easy to overfit data (i.e. achieve the lowest loss possible), provided a large enough network, and a large enough computational budget. However, shape of the minima, or performance on validation sets are in a quite fascinating way influenced by optimisation. 
Optimisation in the beginning of the trajectory, steers such trajectory towards minima of certain properties that go much further than just training accuracy.</p>
<p>As always we spoke about the future of AI and the role deep learning will play.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In this episode I explain how a research group from the University of Lubeck dominated the curse of dimensionality for the generation of large medical images with GANs. 
The problem is not as trivial as it seems. Many researchers have failed in generating large images with GANs before. One interesting application of such approach is in medicine for the generation of CT and X-ray images.

The problem is not as trivial as it seems. Many researchers have failed in generating large images with GANs before. One interesting application of such approach is in medicine for the generation of CT and X-ray images.<br>

<p>After reinforcement learning agents doing great at playing Atari video games, Alpha Go, doing financial trading, dealing with language modeling, let me tell you the real story here.
In this episode I want to shine some light on reinforcement learning (RL) and the limitations that every practitioner should consider before taking certain directions. RL seems to work so well! What is wrong with it?</p>

<p>In this episode I have an amazing conversation with Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman, authors of “A mind at play”, a book entirely dedicated to the life and achievements of Claude Shannon. Claude Shannon does not need any introduction. But for those who need a refresh, Shannon is the inventor of the information age. </p>
<p>Have you heard of binary code, entropy in information theory, data compression theory (the stuff behind mp3, mpg, zip, etc.), error correcting codes (the stuff that makes your RAM work well), n-grams, block ciphers, the beta distribution, the uncertainty coefficient?</p>
<p>All that stuff has been invented by Claude Shannon :) </p>

<p>In this episode I have an amazing conversation with Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman, authors of <em>“A mind at play”</em>, a book entirely dedicated to the life and achievements of Claude Shannon. Claude Shannon does not need any introduction. But for those who need a refresh, Shannon is the inventor of the information age. </p>
<p>Have you heard of binary code, entropy in information theory, data compression theory (the stuff behind mp3, mpg, zip, etc.), error correcting codes (the stuff that makes your RAM work well), n-grams, block ciphers, the beta distribution, the uncertainty coefficient?</p>
<p>All that stuff has been invented by Claude Shannon :) </p>

<p>As ML plays a more and more relevant role in many domains of everyday life, it’s quite obvious to see more and more attacks to ML systems. In this episode we talk about the most popular attacks against machine learning systems and some mitigations designed by researchers Ambra Demontis and Marco Melis, from the University of Cagliari (Italy). The guests are also the authors of SecML, an open-source Python library for the security evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Both Ambra and Marco are members of research group <a href='https://pralab.diee.unica.it/'>PRAlab</a>, under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Roli.

<p style="text-align:left;">Scaling technology and business processes are not equal.

<p>In this episode, I am with <a href='/datascienceathome/episode/update/id/%20https:/skylion007.github.io/'>Aaron Gokaslan</a>, computer vision researcher, AI Resident at Facebook AI Research. Aaron is the author of OpenGPT-2, a parallel NLP model to the most discussed version that OpenAI decided not to release because too accurate to be published. </p>
<p>We discuss about image-to-image translation, the dangers of the GPT-2 model and the future of AI. 
Moreover, Aaron provides some very interesting links and demos that will blow your mind!</p>

Enjoy the show!

<p>Training neural networks faster usually involves the usage of powerful GPUs. In this episode I explain an interesting method from a group of researchers from Google Brain, who can train neural networks faster by squeezing the hardware to their needs and making the training pipeline more dense.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In this episode I explain how a research group from the University of Lubeck dominated the curse of dimensionality for the generation of large medical images with GANs. 
The problem is not as trivial as it seems. Many researchers have failed in generating large images with GANs before. One interesting application of such approach is in medicine for the generation of CT and X-ray images.
Enjoy the show!</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode, I am with Dr. Charles Martin from Calculation Consulting a machine learning and data science consulting company based in San Francisco. We speak about the nuts and bolts of deep neural networks and some impressive findings about the way they work. 
The questions that Charles answers in the show are essentially two:
Why is regularisation in deep learning seemingly quite different than regularisation in other areas on ML?
How can we dominate DNN in a theoretically principled way?

<p>Training neural networks faster usually involves the usage of powerful GPUs. In this episode I explain an interesting method from a group of researchers from Google Brain, who can train neural networks faster by squeezing the hardware to their needs and making the training pipeline more dense.</p>

<p>Chris and I recently got in touch at The banking scene 2019, fintech conference recently held in Brussels. During that conference he talked as a real trouble maker - that’s how he defines himself - saying that “People are not educated with loans, credit, money” and that “Banks are failing at digital”. </p>
<p>After I got my hands on his last book Digital Human, I invited him to the show to ask him a few questions about innovation, regulation and technology in finance.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode I speak to Alexandr Honchar, data scientist and owner of blog <a href='https://medium.com/@alexrachnog'>https://medium.com/@alexrachnog</a>
Alexandr has written very interesting posts about time series analysis for financial data. His blog is in my personal list of best tutorial blogs. 

We discuss about financial time series and machine learning, what makes predicting the price of stocks a very challenging task and why machine learning might not be enough.
As usual, I ask Alexandr how he sees machine learning in the next 10 years. His answer - in my opinion quite futuristic - makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>Chris and I recently got in touch at The banking scene 2019, fintech conference recently held in Brussels. During that conference he talked as a real trouble maker - that’s how he defines himself - saying that “People are not educated with loans, credit, money” and that “Banks are failing at digital”. </p>
<p>After I got my hands on his last book Digital Human, I invited him to the show to ask him a few questions about innovation, regulation and technology in finance.</p>

When you are collaborating with diverse teams, several tasks will be distributed among different individuals. Everyone will have good reasons to change parts of your pipeline, leading to confusion and definitely a number of options that soon explode. 
In all those cases, tracking data and code is extremely helpful to build models that are reproducible anytime, anywhere.

His adventure with AI started in the 90s and since then a long list of experiences at the intersection of computer science and physics, led him to the conclusion that deep learning might not be sufficient nor appropriate to solve the problem of intelligence, specifically artificial intelligence.  
I read some of his publications and got familiar with some of his ideas. Honestly, I have been attracted by the fact that Filip does not buy the hype around AI and deep learning in particular. 
He doesn’t seem to share the vision of folks like Elon Musk who claimed that we are going to see an exponential improvement in self driving cars among other things (he actually said that before a Tesla drove over a pedestrian).</p>

<p>While many machine learning models rely on certain amounts of data eg. text, images, audio and video, it has been proved how powerful is the signal carried by metadata, that is all data that is invisible to the end user.
Behind a tweet of 140 characters there are more than 140 fields of data that draw a much more detailed profile of the sender and the content she is producing... without ever considering the tweet itself.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deep learning models have shown very promising results in computer vision and sound recognition. As more and more deep learning based systems get integrated in disparate domains, they will keep affecting the life of people.

As a very general rule, the more one compresses an image the lower the quality, due to a number of factors like bitrate, quantization error, etcetera. I am glad to be here with Tong Chen,  researcher at the School of electronic Science and Engineering of Nanjing University, China. </p>
<p>Tong developed a deep learning based compression algorithm for images, that seems to improve over state of the art approaches like BPG, JPEG2000 and JPEG.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deep learning models have shown very promising results in computer vision and sound recognition. As more and more deep learning based systems get integrated in disparate domains, they will keep affecting the life of people. Autonomous vehicles, medical imaging and banking applications, surveillance cameras and drones, digital assistants, are only a few real applications where deep learning plays a fundamental role.

His adventure with AI started in the 90s and since then a long list of experiences at the intersection of computer science and physics, led him to the conclusion that deep learning might not be sufficient nor appropriate to solve the problem of intelligence, specifically artificial intelligence.  
I read some of his publications and got familiar with some of his ideas. Honestly, I have been attracted by the fact that Filip does not buy the hype around AI and deep learning in particular. 
He doesn’t seem to share the vision of folks like Elon Musk who claimed that we are going to see an exponential improvement in self driving cars among other things (he actually said that before a Tesla drove over a pedestrian).</p>

Honestly, I have been attracted by the fact that Filip does not buy the hype around AI and deep learning in particular. He doesn’t seem to share the vision of folks like Elon Musk who claimed that we are going to see an exponential improvement in self driving cars among other things (he actually said that before a Tesla drove over a pedestrian).]]></itunes:summary>

Overview
<p>Francesco Gadaleta introduces Fitchain, a decentralized machine learning platform that combines blockchain technology and AI to solve the data manipulation problem in restrictive environments such as healthcare or financial institutions.<a href='http://cryptoradio.io/francesco'>Francesco Gadaleta</a> is the founder of <a href='http://cryptoradio.io/fitchain_io'>Fitchain.io</a> and senior advisor to <a href='http://cryptoradio.io/abe'>Abe AI</a>. Fitchain is a platform that officially started in October 2017, which allows data scientists to write machine learning models on data they cannot see and access due to restrictions imposed in healthcare or financial environments. In the Fitchain platform, there are two actors, the data owner and the data scientist. They both run the Fitchain POD, which orchestrates the relationship between these two sides. The idea behind Fitchain is summarized in the thesis “do not move the data, move the model – bring the model where the data is stored.”</p>
<p>The Fitchain team has also coined a new term called “proof of train” – a way to guarantee that the model is truly trained at the organization, and that it becomes traceable on the blockchain. To develop the complex technological aspects of the platform, Fitchain has partnered up with <a href='http://cryptoradio.io/trent-mcconaghy-ocean-bigchaindb/'>BigChainDB</a>, the project we have recently featured on Crypto Radio.</p>
Roadmap
<p>Fitchain team is currently validating the assumptions and increasing the security of the platform. In the next few months, they will extend the portfolio of machine learning libraries and are planning to move from a B2B product towards a Fitchain for consumers. </p>
<p>By June 2018 they plan to start the Internet of PODs. They will also design the Fitchain token – FitCoin, which will be a utility token to enable operating on the Fitchain platform.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[The enthusiasm for artificial intelligence is raising some concerns especially with respect to some ventured conclusions about what AI can really do and what its direct descendent, artificial general intelligence would be capable of doing in the immediate future. From stealing jobs, to exterminating the entire human race, the creativity (of some) seems to have no limits. In this episode I make sure that everyone comes back to reality - which might sound less exciting than Hollywood but definitely more... real. ]]></itunes:summary>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">In machine learning and data science in general it is very common to deal at some point with imbalanced datasets and class distributions. This is the typical case where the number of observations that belong to one class is significantly lower than those belonging to the other classes.  Actually this happens all the time, in several domains, from finance, to healthcare to social media, just to name a few I have personally worked with. 
Think about a bank detecting fraudulent transactions among millions or billions of daily operations, or equivalently in healthcare for the identification of rare disorders. 
In genetics but also with clinical lab tests this is a normal scenario, in which, fortunately there are very few patients affected by a disorder and therefore very few cases wrt the large pool of healthy patients (or not affected). 
There is no algorithm that can take into account the class distribution or the amount of observations in each class, if it is not explicitly designed to handle such situations.
 In this episode I speak about some effective techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, advising the right method, or the most appropriate one to the right dataset or problem.</p>

According to the general definition of ensembling, it consists in building a number of single classifiers and then combining or aggregating their predictions into one classifier that is usually stronger than the single one.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The key idea behind ensembling is that some models will do well when they model certain aspects of the data while others will do well in modelling other aspects.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Continuing the discussion of the last two episodes, there is one more aspect of deep learning that I would love to consider and therefore left as a full episode, that is parallelising and distributing deep learning on relatively large clusters.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As a matter of fact, computing architectures are changing in a way that is encouraging parallelism more than ever before. And deep learning is no exception and despite the greatest improvements with commodity GPUs - graphical processing units, when it comes to speed, there is still room for improvement.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Together with the last two episodes, this one completes the picture of deep learning at scale. Indeed, as I mentioned in the previous episode, How to master optimisation in deep learning, the function optimizer is the horsepower of deep learning and neural networks in general. A slow and inaccurate optimisation method leads to networks that slowly converge to unreliable results.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In another episode titled “Additional strategies for optimizing deeplearning” I explained some ways to improve function minimisation and model tuning in order to get better parameters in less time. So feel free to listen to these episodes again, share them with your friends, even re-broadcast or download for your commute. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">While the methods that I have explained so far represent a good starting point for prototyping a network, when you need to switch to production environments or take advantage of the most recent and advanced hardware capabilities of your GPU, well... in all those cases, you would like to do something more.  </p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">In the last episode How to master optimisation in deep learning I explained some of the most challenging tasks of deep learning and some methodologies and algorithms to improve the speed of convergence of a minimisation method for deep learning. 
I explored the family of gradient descent methods - even though not exhaustively - giving a list of approaches that deep learning researchers are considering for different scenarios. Every method has its own benefits and drawbacks, pretty much depending on the type of data, and data sparsity. But there is one method that seems to be, at least empirically, the best approach so far. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Feel free to <a href='https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-y75qj-700faa'>listen</a> to the previous episode, <a href='https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-y75qj-700faa'>share</a> it, re-broadcast or just <a href='https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-y75qj-700faa'>download</a> for your commute.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In this episode I would like to continue that conversation about some additional strategies for optimising gradient descent in deep learning and introduce you to some tricks that might come useful when your neural network stops learning from data or when the learning process becomes so slow that it really seems it reached a plateau even by feeding in fresh data. </p>
