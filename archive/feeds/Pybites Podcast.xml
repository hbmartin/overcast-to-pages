    <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is a bit special. Julian is joined by one of his closest friends and former AWS colleagues, Huy Nguyen, to talk about something we often overlook in our careers and lives ‚Äî the power of genuine human connection.<br/><br/>In 2024, Huy made an unusual choice. He chose to get off the hamster wheel and take a career break to focus the entire year on being present with friends and community. From a Big Fat Greek wedding in Greece to conversations on balconies in Vietnam, his travels weren‚Äôt about sightseeing. They were about belonging.<br/><br/>Together, Huy and Julian unpack what it takes to build a strong community over time. Huy shares two timeless principles that guide his approach: show up and be curious. You don‚Äôt need any plan or intention beyond these two things. Making time and being interested is enough. Messy is still effective if you show up with curiosity.<br/><br/>They also dig into:</p><ul><li>The quiet epidemic of disconnection, and what to do about it<br/><br/></li><li>Why texting someone you haven‚Äôt spoken to in years is never as weird as you think<br/><br/></li><li>How connection can be one of the most overlooked forms of self-care<br/><br/></li><li>Why moments of ‚ÄúI was just thinking about you‚Äù matter more than you realize</li></ul><p><br/>This episode is warm, honest, and full of the kind of reflections that tend to stick with you.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to the Pybites Podcast. We&apos;ve been teasing this for a while, and it&apos;s finally here: our Python Developer Certificates. <br/><br/>They&apos;re not just shiny badges. They&apos;re the real deal, representing solid Python skills, experience with frameworks like Django/FastAPI, debugging, testing, professional developer workflow / collaboration, deployment, and so much more (see assessment criteria below). <br/><br/>Unlike other theoretical (rote learning) certifications ours cover MVP-ready + deployed projects. In this episode we talk about our vision with this and address some common concerns like pricing, time commitment, how long they are valid for, and more.<br/><br/>As our programs and certifications are so unique and individualized, if interested in this, we encourage you to hop on a call with us to further discuss how this can help you in your career.<br/><br/>Links:<br/>- <a href='https://pybit.es/python-certifications/'>Certification homepage</a><br/>- <a href='https://pybit.es/python-certifications/pcpd-a/'>PCPD-A (associate)</a><br/>- <a href='https://pybit.es/python-certifications/pcpd-p/'>PCPD-P (professional)</a><br/>- <a href='https://pybit.es/python-certifications/assessment-criteria/'>Assessment criteria</a><br/>- <a href='https://go.oncehub.com/pybiteschat'>Books us in for a call</a><br/><br/>Books mentioned:<br/>- <a href='https://pybitesbooks.com/books/K6AYaA-mTk0C'>Steal Like an Artist</a><br/>- <a href='https://pybitesbooks.com/books/tSiNEAAAQBAJ'>War and Peace</a><br/>- <a href='https://pybitesbooks.com/books/hGFEDwAAQBAJ'>The Courage to Be Disliked</a><br/><br/>Chapters:<br/>00:00 Intro<br/>01:27 Announcing Pybites developer certification<br/>02:38 What?!

In our conversation we dive into some of the specific challenges and opportunities that come with packaging Python code.<br/><br/>One of the things that we discuss is the backstory behind Dane‚Äôs book on packaging. Dane talks about how he scratched his own itch by open sourcing some packaging code that he had developed at work. He then began to explore some of the patterns and practices around packaging that worked really well. His passion for helping other people distribute their code was also a strong motivator.<br/><br/>We also talk about where people struggle with packaging, and how some of the perceptions around packaging come from the history and diversity of tooling in the Python ecosystem. However, Dane points out that there is a more extensible architecture now, which has turned into more of a plugin-like architecture.<br/><br/>Dane then dives into some specific topics from his book, including the debate between using a src vs flat directory structure, the benefits of using a pyproject.toml file as a unified way of specifying dependencies and tooling, and how a tool like tox (or nox) is invaluable for orchestrating all the tooling around Python package management.<br/><br/>We also discuss some of the challenges around dependency hell, and some tips for managing this more effectively. Dane talks about the importance of using Github Actions as a way of automating CI/CD workflows, and how this can be a big time saver, particularly when the amount of projects you‚Äôre maintaining adds up.<br/><br/>Finally, we touch on the community aspect of packaging, and some tips for open source maintainers and contributors. Dane shares some of the unexpected things he learned from writing his book, as well as some advice for keeping up with the Python ecosystem and trends in the tech space.<br/><br/>Overall, we really enjoyed producing this episode.

Having the confidence to embrace it and do it is key.</li><li>Focusing on your superpowers helps you take focus away from what you feel are your shortcomings.</li><li>Being your authentic self earns trust!</li><li>When you show up authentically it has a ripple effect and allows others to do the same.</li></ul><p><br/><b>Hannah&apos;s Actionable Tips to being your authentic self:<br/></b><br/></p><ul><li>First, look inward. You need to know the strengths that make you uniquely you.</li><li>Second, ask others that you trust to validate what your strengths are.</li><li>Third, show up and speak up! You&apos;ve got this! You&apos;re the expert at your strengths, you can do it, don&apos;t back down, be yourself.</li><li>Four, be ready for discomfort. It&apos;s not going to feel amazing the first time and that&apos;s FINE. Just keep doing the work and you&apos;ll get stronger and better at it.</li><li>Five, YOUV&apos;E GOT THIS (again!).</li></ul><p><br/><b>References:</b></p><ul><li><em>The Memo - </em><a href='https://www.mindaharts.com/thememo'>https://www.mindaharts.com/thememo</a></li></ul><p><br/><b>Where you can find Hannah:<br/></b><br/></p><ul><li><b>LinkedIn:</b> <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahkook/'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahkook/</a></li><li><b>Twitter:</b> <a href='https://twitter.com/kookiezh'>https://twitter.com/kookiezh</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;<br/></em><br/>It really pays off to be the person that <b>has been in the trenches</b>, that gets their hands dirty.<br/><br/>It makes you an <b>effective leader</b>, it earns you trust and makes you well-rounded (as per our motto: <em>we create well-rounded developers</em>).<br/><br/>As usual we share some stories of our own:<br/><br/>- Julian had a manager with exceptional technical skills and not shying away from getting his hands dirty, he really formed an inspiration of how to <em>lead by example</em>.<br/><br/>- Bob&apos;s story revolves around his pivot from software developer into coach (of our clients) and how getting knee deep into the code with them is so valuable for their further progression as developers, their working relation, but also for Bob&apos;s own growth.<br/><br/>So think about how you can lead by example, <b>get into the arena</b> and <b>be willing to fail</b> because remember: without failure there is no growth!<br/><br/>For career advice and in order to take your Python and developer skills to the next level, <a href='https://go.oncehub.com/pybites'>book us in for a call</a>, we love to help you!<br/> <br/>Books mentioned:<br/>- <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399592520/?tag=pyb0f-20'>Dare to Lead: Brave Work.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We started reading <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399592520/?tag=pyb0f-20'>Dare to Lead</a> which starts with <a href='https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/63389/roosevelts-man-arena'>a great quote from Roosevelt</a>:<br/><br/><em>&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;<br/></em><br/>It really pays off to be the person that <b>has been in the trenches</b>, that gets their hands dirty.<br/><br/>It makes you an <b>effective leader</b>, it earns you trust and makes you well-rounded (as per our motto: <em>we create well-rounded developers</em>).<br/><br/>As usual we share some stories of our own:<br/><br/>- Julian had a manager with exceptional technical skills and not shying away from getting his hands dirty, he really formed an inspiration of how to <em>lead by example</em>.<br/><br/>- Bob&apos;s story revolves around his pivot from software developer into coach (of our clients) and how getting knee deep into the code with them is so valuable for their further progression as developers, their working relation, but also for Bob&apos;s own growth.<br/><br/>So think about how you can lead by example, <b>get into the arena</b> and <b>be willing to fail</b> because remember: without failure there is no growth!<br/><br/>For career advice and in order to take your Python and developer skills to the next level, <a href='https://go.oncehub.com/pybites'>book us in for a call</a>, we love to help you!<br/> <br/>Books mentioned:<br/>- <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399592520/?tag=pyb0f-20'>Dare to Lead: Brave Work.
