Team members rarely understand how their work impacts business outcomes, leading to data graveyards instead of value, with success measured by vibes rather than revenue. Join us as Blake proposes embedding data experts within business units, developing "full-stack" practitioners, and designing initiatives that begin with clear business actions.

We'll explore his concept of Evaluation-Driven Development (EDD) and how treating evaluation as a continuous process—not just a final step—can help teams escape "Proof-of-Concept Purgatory." How can we build AI applications that remain reliable and adaptable over time? What shifts are happening as boundaries between data, ML, and product development collapse? From practical testing approaches to monitoring strategies, this episode offers essential insights for anyone looking to create AI applications that deliver genuine business value beyond the initial excitement.</p>

You have to actually drive the vehicle to get to a place that delivers value. Sounds obvious right? But we don’t instinctively think this way when it comes to data.

<p>This week, Tim and Juan are joined by <a href='https://www.intelligentbusiness.biz/about-us/company-profile/'>Mike Ferguson</a>, managing director of Intelligent Business Strategies Limited to look at why we’re not using data nearly as effectively as we think and what can be done about it.</p>
<p>This episode will feature:</p>

 <li>How to get your company aligned on effective data use and measurement?</li>
 <li>What’s the most expensive thing you bought that you’ve never used?</li>

Listen and learn from Teresa Tung Chief Technologist of Accenture’s Cloud First group , Zhamak Dehghani director of emerging technologies at Thoughtworks and founder of Data Mesh concept, and Jay Yu, Distinguished Architect at Intuit.
You can watch the panel here and follow Juan’s takeaways.]]></itunes:summary>

<p>As the year winds down, we're revisiting our favorite (and most popular) episodes exploring some of the more unique data roles out there.

Have a happy, healthy new year, everyone. We'll see you again in 2021.</p>

In this short episode, Tim and Juan reflect on what they’re thankful for (including the community that’s grown around this podcast). Join our hosts as they relive their favorite highlights from past Catalog &amp; Cocktails conversations and look forward to upcoming guests. 


P.S. Usually, we record this podcast in a live Zoom meeting that anyone can attend. We then stick around for a virtual “afterparty” to further discuss that week’s topic as a group. (See our bio for the link.) This week, we skipped that live Wednesday evening event to give our team time to focus on things away from the desk. We hope you’ll have an opportunity to do the same and that you too have many, many reasons to be thankful.]]></description>

Do you build a data lake/warehouse first and then catalog the data, or should you catalog your data before kicking off your warehouse initiative? Join Juan and Tim as they discuss why and how you can and should do both at the same time. This week's special guest: Jon Loyens, data.world's CPO, co-founder, and co-creator of this podcast's theme song.</p>
<p>This 30-minute episode will cover:</p>
<ul><li>The pros and cons of which project to tackle first</li>
 <li>How to get it right by applying agile methodologies</li>

This prediction by IDC suggests a large number of companies are still using manual and complex processes to make sense of data. This includes standing up multiple data lakes, disparate database technologies, and a rash of BI tools. The struggle is real. So is the benefit of an enterprise data catalog.</p>
<p>Join Juan, Tim, and Stewart Coerver, director of sales engineering at data.world, to talk about how to untangle the data mess in your organization.

Everywhere we look we find statistics: number of coronavirus cases, unemployment levels, economic predictions, etc. But this unprecedented access to data also leaves us with lots of questions:</p>
