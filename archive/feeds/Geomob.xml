                    <![CDATA[Adam DuVander returns to the podcast to discuss the evolving geospatial developer landscape, particularly in the context of low-code tools and AI's impact on the industry. They explore the scepticism surrounding AI's reliability in geospatial services, the blind trust some developers place in AI outputs, and the challenges of ensuring data accuracy. The conversation also touches on the importance of creating unique content amidst a sea of generic AI-generated material and the role of developers in guiding new users through the complexities of these technologies.

<p>Doug Specht, a cultural geographer, joins Steven to discuss the power and limitations of maps in representing complex human experiences, particularly in times of conflict. He highlights the decisions that cartographers make about what to include and what to leave out, and how these choices can shape our understanding of a place or situation. Doug emphasizes the importance of recognizing that maps are not neutral or objective, but rather laden with power and subjectivity. He also explores the role of technology in mapping and the need for readers to critically engage with maps and understand their purpose.</p>

<p>Dr. Robin Cole joins Alastair to discuss the application of deep learning to satellite imagery and the growing community in this field. Robin shares his background in optical physics and how he transitioned into remote sensing and deep learning. Deep learning, a specific part of the AI family, uses neural networks to process satellite imagery and has seen significant advancements since 2012. The volume of satellite imagery requires automated means of analysis and indexing, and deep learning models have made this possible. There are standardized methods and libraries, such as PyTorch and TorchGeo, that facilitate deep learning in the geospatial domain. The community Robin has built focuses on sharing resources, knowledge, and expertise in deep learning and Earth observation.</p>

The conversation covers topics such as the general availability of Overture Maps, the data themes available, accessing the data, the hierarchy of sources for buildings data, and the challenges and improvements of the places data. The episode highlights the importance of cloud-native formats and the potential for integrating open data with proprietary data. Overture is focused on creating an open base layer for mapping data that can be used by application developers. They aim to provide a global, open, and entity-based reference system that allows for the conflation of data from various sources. The goal is to create a comprehensive and up-to-date map dataset that can be distributed to billions of people. Finally, Marc shares why he sees the relationship with OpenStreetMap as complimentary.  </p>

The goal is to create a comprehensive and up-to-date map dataset that can be distributed to billions of people. Finally, Marc shares why he sees the relationship with OpenStreetMap as complimentary.

They explore the idea that maps are a form of communication and should be used when they are the best tool for conveying information. They discuss the importance of thoughtful map design and the need to consider the audience and purpose of the map. They lament the proliferation of maps that may not be effective or meaningful. Steven and Ken discuss maps that they regret making, sharing examples of maps that they created but later realized were unnecessary, poorly designed, or insensitive. Overall, they emphasize the importance of asking the right questions and making intentional decisions when creating maps.</p>

Geoff explains his background in geospatial and his work on the UK Land Cover Map projects. They discuss the importance of existing land cover datasets like CORINE and the UK Land Cover Map, and how they can be used for localized land cover data. They also delve into the role of Copernicus, the European Earth Observation Service, and its land monitoring service. Geoff explains the concept of EAGLE, a hierarchical approach to describing land cover and land use, and how it relates to CORINE. Finally (how could it be otherwise) they touch on the potential role of AI in land cover mapping and the challenges it presents.</p>

                    <![CDATA[In this episode we introduce new co-host Alastair Graham, who wil take the lead on all things Earth Observation here on the Geomob podcast!
 
Long-time geospatial podcast listeners will of course recognize Alastair from the Scene From Above podcast which he co-hosted for several years. We are delighted to add his experience and insights to the show. We discuss Alastair's background in geospatial and Earth observation, and his reasons for returning to podcasting. We then also explore the challenges of making the Earth observation industry commercially viable and the need for education and use cases to create awareness and demand.
 
It's exciting to add a new voice to the show. Welcome Alastair!

The project focused on using rainfall data to find optimal school hours in sub-Saharan Africa. Gispo specializes in open source geospatial tools and works with both local and global clients. We also briefly discuss the Finnish geospatial scene, which has a strong emphasis on open source, with many companies using tools like QGIS. The project for UNESCO is still being tested, but the QGIS plugin they developed has the potential for impact in the community. The conversation also touches on the importance of open data and the power of OpenStreetMap in school projects.</p>

They discuss the frustration of navigating the last 100 meters of a delivery and the need for efficient routing and parking solutions. Jake explains how doorways.ai provides navigable geocoding, doorway geocoding, and optimized paths that avoid barriers. He also highlights the challenges of geocoding and routing in complex areas and the potential for using AI and machine learning in the future. The recently-founded company now exposes a public demo so potential users can see the benefits of doorstep level geocoding. Finally, no discussion of geocoding or routing would be complete with out a horror story. Jake and team have done the analysis and found the worst routing example in the UK.</p>

Joining Steven are Renee Babb, Lavern Ryan, and Alan Mills. The focus of the discussion is the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and their partnership with MapAction. Lavern has been working at the government of the small community of Montserrat and she is also a volunteer with MapAction. She has some great insight about the use of GIS for land use planning, biodiversity and conservation and disaster risk reduction. The Caribbean is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters due to its location, but organisations such as CDEMA have been helping to ease the burden before, during, and after these disasters occur. Renee, who is from Barbados, is the GIS specialist at CDEMA. Alan has been with MapAction for over 15 years and has undertaken many emergency missions in the Caribbean. Tune in to find out what it's like to experience these disasters first hand, how the different organisations find ways to collaborate and to learn if the systems in place can be used in other regions.</p>

                    <![CDATA[We start off 2024 with a new series focussing on the humanitarian use of GIS and partnering with MapAction, the humanitarian mapping charity and volunteer driven organisation that works with local and regional disaster management agencies worldwide. Joining Steven are Renee Babb, Lavern Ryan, and Alan Mills. The focus of the discussion is the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and their partnership with MapAction. Lavern has been working at the government of the small community of Montserrat and she is also a volunteer with MapAction. She has some great insight about the use of GIS for land use planning, biodiversity and conservation and disaster risk reduction. The Caribbean is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters due to its location, but organisations such as CDEMA have been helping to ease the burden before, during, and after these disasters occur. Renee, who is from Barbados, is the GIS specialist at CDEMA. Alan has been with MapAction for over 15 years and has undertaken many emergency missions in the Caribbean. Tune in to find out what it's like to experience these disasters first hand, how the different organisations find ways to collaborate and to learn if the systems in place can be used in other regions.

Editors have come a long way since OSM started. The main difference is that everyone now has a mobile device, and for some users, that’s all they have. The devices themselves have evolved with a wide range of features and sensors, how do they impact the capabilities of OSM editors such as Vespucci?

Petya is an Open Tech Advocate and works in Community Engagement at HOTOSM. Proving that you don’t need to have a degree in tech to make an impact, Petya explains there are many ways of getting involved even if you’re new to tech or mapping. Steven and Petya discuss the lack of diversity in tech and ponder how to change that. The first step, according to Petya is having an awareness of your privileges. Only then you can begin to work as an ally. While many focus on the lack of women in tech, it’s not only about gender inclusion but also being inclusive of those who may not have the same access or the language skills. Tune in to find out how HOT is contributing to diversifying and how you can be an ally too.</p>

Hannah explains how Data Appeal is processing and organising geospatial data for brands to use in marketing campaigns. Listen in as she explains the process of sorting through the vast amount of data and making it useful for clients such as Best Western and the Campari Group. Simplifying and democratising data is the mission, and there certainly is a lot to work. Hannah explains some use cases, how AI tech contributes, and how data literacy varies geographically. Tune in to learn which industries are at the forefront of utilising geographic data and who could benefit making better use of data.

Ben is not new to State of the Map, he has been a part of the OSM community for over 15 years and has organised State of the Map before. Ben fills us in on the Belgium OSM community. Ed and Ben exchange ideas on how to get a younger generation involved in not only mapping but also participating in organising these crucial networking events. This year the focus will be less on content and more on the social side of the conference so many chances for those who are looking to connect and networking with the OSM community to do so. Tune in to find out why you should come to Antwerp in November.</p>

                    <![CDATA[Ed and Steven take a break from summer break to chime in on some recent geonews. First up they consider the Overture dataset release, then the discussion turns to whether Apple Maps has improved and/or whether Google Maps has worsened.
 
Enjoy the break everyone and we hope to see you at Geomob events in September.

Dario explains how Textomap differs from other map creation websites/apps: there is no need for app or tool downloads and there are several ways to turn text into a map, even using an AI prompt. To put it simply, it’s fast, easy and helpful for travellers, content creators, teachers and anyone who may need a quick map.

Dario explains how Textomap differs from other map creation websites/apps: there is no need for app or tool downloads and there are several ways to turn text into a map, even using an AI prompt. To put it simply, it’s fast, easy and helpful for travellers, content creators, teachers and anyone who may need a quick map. Tune in to find out how a two-person, husband and wife team manages this major task.</div>

To help answer this question this week Ed welcomes Roman Tsisyk to the podcast. Roman, a co-founder of <a href="https://organicmaps.app">Organic Maps</a>, the most widely used consumer-facing, OSM-based mapping service. In their discussion, Ed and Roman explain the differences users experience with Google Maps vs OSM and discuss how the two can work together. Organic Maps is a privacy-focused, open-source fork of Maps.me app. The offline feature makes it particularly convenient for travellers, hikers, and cyclists. Listen as Roman explains how he and his team use the power of community to keep evolving their maps, and why having "regular people" contribute to mapping is so important.</p>

To put it simply, CollectiveCrunch counts and analyzes the trees in the forest using remote sensing. Juha and his team combine the latest tech in geospatial including earth observation, machine learning, and AI, to assess forestry needs quickly and accurately. Tackling problems like forest density and bark beetles activity, CollectiveCrunch is able to monitor what goes on in the forest without always needing to travel long distances and measure manually. Listen in as Ed and Juha deep dive into the mechanics of machine learning and AI specifically for forestry and learn about the benefits of this technology for other applications.</p>

Merve studies how people use maps with a focus on eye tracking. With the rise of mobile maps and mapping apps there is an assumption that getting around is simpler, but is it? Do the navigation tools affect our spatial cognition positively or negatively?  Merve explains in detail what you can learn by studying how people use maps and gives some advice to cartographers who want to create maps that people will actually use.

This city wide festival will take place from 3rd to the 9th of July and is meant to bring London’s thriving data community together. It’s also a chance to brainstorm ideas on how to bring useful data to the general public. Joining Steven is Jen Ding of the Alan Turing Institute (and winner of the SplashMap best speaker prize at our April 2023 London event). Jen explains the aims of the week and gives Steven a preview of what to expect. Whether you’re into cycling, comedy, or AI, London Data Week has it all. This community led event aims to encourage people to actively participate in data collection themselves. Events by Citi Maps, <a href="https://thegeomob.com/post/july-5th-2023-geomoblon-details">Geomob London on the evening of July 5th</a>, and Statisticians for Society are just some highlights of the festival, tune in to find out what else is in store and how you can participate.</p>

Melinda's love affair with her hometown continues 30 years on with a new Melbourne map available in traditional or jigsaw form.

For the first time the event was held in a unique hybrid format, with many different venues across the UK. The goal was to capture the benefits of in-person networking and experience, while also reducing the need to travel and, via online streaming, allowing participation from everywhere. Overall the experiment was deemed a great success, with over 300 people attending in-person across the nine venues (many more than previous in-person events), but there are of course lessons learned for future events. Finally, Nick and Kevin share plans for OSGeo:UK in 2023.</p>

                                            <![CDATA[<p>This week Ed chats with one of the most active long-time members of the OpenStreetMap community: Simon Poole. Simon has contributed to OSM in many ways over the years: as a mapper, as developer of one of the most popular editors, as a local organizer of the Swiss OSM community, as a leading member of the Legal working group, and as Chair of the OpenStreetMap Foundation board. He is the perfect person to weigh in on the health of the project, particularly in the context of the latest open mapping news about the start of the Overture Maps Foundation.

                    <![CDATA[This week Ed chats with one of the most active long-time members of the OpenStreetMap community: Simon Poole. Simon has contributed to OSM in many ways over the years: as a mapper, as developer of one of the most popular editors, as a local organizer of the Swiss OSM community, as a leading member of the Legal working group, and as Chair of the OpenStreetMap Foundation board. He is the perfect person to weigh in on the health of the project, particularly in the context of the latest open mapping news about the start of the Overture Maps Foundation.

The geospatial world exploded with speculation about what this might mean for OpenStreetMap and for players like Google and Apple. Is Overture a threat, an opportunity, both, or something else entirely?</p>
<p>Our guest today is Marc Prioleau, geospatial industry veteran (having worked at deCarta, Cloudmade, Mapbox, Uber, and as a consultant for many others) and currently Meta's head of business development for Mapping and Location, to discuss exactly what Overture Maps hopes to be, why it was formed, and its intended place in the geospatial ecosystem. This is the first time one of the members of the OMF consortium has spoken publicly about the initiative.</p>

Steven chats with Max about his geospatial podcast which focuses on the people who create maps. The unique thing about Minds Behind Maps is the long format. If the idea of listening to a three hour long podcast seems daunting, you’re not the only one, but Steven, a self-declared long-form sceptic, was quickly convinced it’s worthwhile. Tune in to find out how the project began and which big names in the mapping community he’s spoken with so far.</p>

Each issue compares and contrasts two airlines. Not just for map nerds, this project attracts graphic designers, artists, and vintage airline magazine lovers. Listen in and you’ll understand why he was the winner of the SplashMaps best speaker prize at our September 28th, 2022 London event.

Melinda Haughey explains how a "mom problem" led to the creation of a customised mapping system. Frustrated with the complexity of Google maps, Melinda and co-founder Chelsey Roney created a simple way of creating personal and shareable maps. Proxi aims to monetise unique maps by providing analytics back to the users/map creators, but that’s not their only aim. The big vision is to create a robust infrastructure of guides that are mapped. Melinda explains how mapped lists make life much more simple and why people the time for their service is now.</p>

FORMATION is a location based approach to digitalising a business. Ian explains the evolution of FORMATION and explains how they cater to their clients based on their needs. FORMATION’s clients include the German Army, Bosch, and Kamax, and various research organisations. Ed wonders how the workers/employees feel about their bosses having their location, especially in a privacy hyper conscious country like Germany. Ian agrees, the drive for privacy is well founded, but the design of FORMATION takes that into account. Everything is designed with the workers themselves in mind because without their support, the system will not last for long.

Adam Simkin is the COO and VP for <a href="https://www.autofleet.io/">autofleet.io</a>, and has been trying to improve the most frustrating part of the app experience: "estimated wait times". As the demand for these services grows, so does the expectation. Customers want short, reliable, and accurate wait times but as Adam admits, this is still a bit of an "unsolved problem". With so many variables, and many competing apps, there is still a lot of work for Adam and his peers to do to improve the experience not only for clients but also drivers/vehicle owners. Find out how far we’ve come, and what the predictions are for the future (autonomous cars?) in this week's podcast!</p>

Motti describes in great detail how he and his team have been able to extract the location of tweets. Only 1-3% of tweets have coordinates, Motti’s methods can increase that number to approximately 15%. How might this be useful? Well for one, distinguishing which tweets come from users that are actually near the event or phenomenon can help to resolve or filter out fake news. They can also analyse how people use Twitter during natural hazard events such as wildfires or floods. Motti spoke about this topic at the recent first ever Geomob Tel Aviv in April 2022. Listen to the fascinating discussion and learn more about the process of location extraction.</div>

Ed compares the recent <a href="https://thegeomob.com/post/june-15th-2022-geomoblon-details">London event</a> with <a href="https://thegeomob.com/post/june-21st-2022-geomobbcn-details">the Barcelona event</a> and ponders if London’s culture of sharing will eventually make its way to Barcelona. Focussing on the highlight of the Barcelona event, he describes the presentation by <a href="https://www.bettermaps.ai">Bettermaps</a>. Although still in the early stages, this app takes a written description of a location and turns it into a map. Ed and Steven discuss the possibilities of AI and the possible elimination of cartographers? We’re not quite there yet, but there certainly is potential in AI. Ed also discusses the recent launch of OpenCage's <a href="https://flipcoords.com">FlipCoords</a> tool, while Steven shares that he will be presenting about Mappery at the British Cartographic Society annual event in September.</p>
<p>Tune in to find out which other OpenCage projects are picking up momentum, where the next Geomob event will take place, and where you may bump into Ed in the summer months.</p>

Ed speaks with Peter Rose, former Geomob speaker and Europe Director of Orbica. Orbica focusses on geospatial analytics, GeoAI and data science. Peter discusses a special project: ‘Lebenswald’ for the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. The goal of this project was to create a recurring revenue model. In order to motivate people to donate to prevent deforestation and preserve the habitat of the last Borneo Orangutans they have created an interactive map. Donors are able to choose the area they want to help preserve, claim it as theirs to sponsor and even draw on it. Peter talks about the challenges and benefits of working for a non-profit client. Tune in to learn more about this important project and great example of using geospatial in philanthropy.</p>

                    <![CDATA[If you’ve ever wondered how you can use a geospatial interface to encourage philanthropy, this is the episode for you. Ed speaks with Peter Rose, former Geomob speaker and Europe Director of Orbica. Orbica focusses on geospatial analytics, GeoAI and data science. Peter discusses a special project: ‘Lebenswald’ for the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. The goal of this project was to create a recurring revenue model. In order to motivate people to donate to prevent deforestation and preserve the habitat of the last Borneo Orangutans they have created an interactive map. Donors are able to choose the area they want to help preserve, claim it as theirs to sponsor and even draw on it. Peter talks about the challenges and benefits of working for a non-profit client. Tune in to learn more about this important project and great example of using geospatial in philanthropy.

Muki is one of the early adopters of combining geography with computer science, and one of the eariest supporters of OpenStreetMap. For the past ten years he has been focusing on extreme citizen science. There are a number of programs and apps that allow people all over the world to contribute geographical and environmental data. His team of 20 researchers work with indigenous communities on developing tools that can be used by anyone, even those who can’t read or write, allowing for more access to relevant data about their own communities. Steven and Muki discuss the benefits and drawbacks of citizen science as it becomes more common.</p>

Ilya is passionate about micro mapping, and argues there is a need for a tool like his but ultimately the time he spends on editing is as much a need as it is enjoyable. This is not his first OSM tool, and this is not the only editor out there, so what’s unique about Every Door? This editor focuses on things that are usually unmapped, the things that are often overlooked because it takes too long and is too tedious to map them. Ilya and Ed discuss the future of mapping apps and predict more thematic mobile editors will emerge (editors for shops, for runners, etc.). Listen to Ilya explain his passion and vision for a POI editor, and offer advice for those who want to create editor tools of their own.</div>

Steven wonders if there really is a benefit for startups in the geospatial industry receiving help from accelerator programs such as the one Geovation provides. As Carly explains, the data speaks for itself, 76% of the startups that have worked with Geovation are still active five years after leaving the program. That's quite impressive considering 90% of startups overall fail within the first five years. Steven and Carly agree, simply having a brilliant idea does not guarantee success, it’s all about having the right solution and the right execution, that's where startup mentor programs such as the one Geovation offers come in.

                                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months the world has been swept with frenzy for the word game Wordle.

Christian's story is an interesting one not just because of the innovative work Teragence does, but becaue he came to entrepreneurship later than most, making the leap to starting a business in mid-career. We cover what exactly Teragence does, and why they don't present themselves as a "GIS company" despite behing heavy users of geotechnology. The conversation then turns to things that might be relevant to other geo start-ups: how Teragence uses one dataset to serve many different types of customers, and how they thrived despite initially trying to sell to large telcos.

In 2009 he gave a much heralded talk "How Neogeography Killed GIS".
