			<description><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enterprise leaders are no longer asking if they should adopt AI — the question is how to do it effectively. In this episode, Emerj Editorial Director Matthew DeMello speaks with James Raybould, SVP and GM of Turing Intelligence at Turing, about what distinguishes successful enterprise AI deployments from stalled pilots. Turing is one of the world’s fastest-growing Artificial Intelligence companies, helping businesses solve their toughest problems with AI—delivering real business results faster, smarter, and at scale—while also working with top AI companies to push the technology forward. Based in San Francisco, Turing was named the #1 most promising B2B company by The Information and is led by AI experts from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Stanford, MIT, and more. James outlines three critical factors that determine whether an AI initiative gets traction: business alignment, workforce readiness, and infrastructure. He explains why companies that start with the technology — instead of the problem — are likely to fall behind, and what it really means to prepare a workforce for AI when automation changes the expectations of work quality and speed.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In this episode of the ‘AI in Business’ podcast, Scott Bradley, VP of AI and Innovation at Novartis, returns to discuss how AI is reshaping decision-making at the earliest stages of drug development—and what that means for the future of pharma investment strategy. Host Matthew DeMello and Scott explore how the pharmaceutical industry is transitioning from intuition-led portfolio choices to data-driven precision. They discuss the growing influence of AI in identifying viable drug candidates, designing complex proteins, and even solving long-standing manufacturing challenges. Scott also highlights the impact of AI on shifting portfolio dynamics—enabling pharma companies to target smaller, more specific patient populations and scale up development across a wider range of therapies.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As enterprises double down on generative AI initiatives, the intersection of data security, privacy, and unstructured data is quickly becoming mission-critical. In this episode, Dimitri Sirota, Co-founder and CEO of BigID, joins the podcast to explore how AI transformation is reshaping enterprise data governance, security, and compliance—and why understanding your “crown jewel” data is essential to building trustworthy AI systems. Dimitri outlines the three major forces driving today’s enterprise data challenges: accelerated cloud migration, a rising tide of global data privacy regulations, and the explosion of generative AI tools that rely on sensitive, unstructured data. He explains how enterprises can gain visibility into their AI programs and the data fueling them, mitigate shadow AI risks, and prepare for the next wave of agentic systems by adopting zero-trust models and real-time monitoring strategies.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Nick Lewis, Managing Director for the High Risk Client Unit at Standard Chartered Bank. Nick joins today’s show to discuss the shifting landscape of fraud prevention and AML compliance in financial services. As governments increasingly shift regulatory responsibilities onto the private sector, banks find themselves at the forefront of both enforcement and risk management. Lewis highlights how sanctions regimes have evolved, pushing financial institutions to shoulder greater due diligence responsibilities with fewer resources. His conversation with Emerj Editorial Director Matthew DeMello also explores the broader implications of this public-private realignment, including the increasing reliance on AI-driven detection methods and the complexities of prioritizing financial crime risks. Lewis underscores the growing role of banks in addressing crimes such as human trafficking, despite the lack of formal mandates, and how AI could enhance collaboration with law enforcement to identify and mitigate emerging threats.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Virginia Dignum, Director of the AI Policy Lab, Professor of Computer Science at Umeå University, and an Associated Professor at Delft University of Technology. In this special episode of the “AI Futures” series on the AI in Business podcast, we offer an exclusive sample from the Trajectory podcast, hosted by Emerj CEO and Head of Research Daniel Faggella. Together, Virginia and Daniel hypothesize what human governance over artificial general intelligence (AGI) might look like, and the many challenges NGOs and international bodies face today in creating the foundations for these governing structures. Virginia challenges the prevalent AGI narrative, advocating instead for a focus on what she terms “Human General Intelligence” (HGI), emphasizing collaboration and human-machine augmentation over existential AI risks. The discussion explores why governing AI requires a socio-technical approach, ensuring accountability rests with humans rather than machines. Virginia also highlights the importance of global governance to address both the risks and equitable benefits of AI, touching on her hands-on experience with international policy groups. If you’re interested in getting more perspectives on AI’s longer term impact on business and society, be sure to tune into the Trajectory podcast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In another installment of our ‘AI Futures’ series on the ‘AI in Business’ podcast, we host a debate on what Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will mean for society and the human race writ large. While opinions on the subject diverge wildly from utopian to apocalyptic, the episode features grounded insight from established voices on both sides of the optimism-pessimism spectrum. Representing optimists is philosopher and thinker Roko Mijic, famous for the ‘Roko’s Basilisk’ controversy on the website Lesswrong. On the side of skepticism, we feature Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Louisville and a returning guest to the program. The two spar over whether or not AI with evident superior abilities to human beings will mean our certain destruction or whether such creations can remain subservient to our well-being.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Caroline Gorski, CEO of R² Factory – a data and tech-focused subsidiary of Rolls Royce. In conversation with Emerj CEO Daniel Faggella, they discuss being a new kind of company underneath a century-old legacy luxury name brand in heavy industry and the benefits of creating a separate experimentation-first culture within a big enterprise.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Kelly Harlin, Director of Solutions Marketing and Commercialization at Sharp NEC. Sharp and NEC collectively have approximately 160 thousand employees as two of Japan’s largest electronics manufacturers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Aakash Indurkhya, Co-Head of AI at Virtualitics. Virtualitics is a venture-backed firm based in Pasadena, California. In this episode, we discuss what it means to explore our data and identify where the gaps in our data quality or potentially the gaps in essential data fields are. Aakash speaks to us this week about not only what exploration, that is to say, why it’s valuable conceptually – when dealing with tremendous volumes of data, what does exploration accomplish, and where specifically, better exploration can lead to better results? He dives into two specific use-cases, one in drug development and one in retail. While these are vastly different worlds, these use-cases focus on exploring data well to train an AI model and deliver the desired results in the enterprise. Aakash provides an excellent conceptual overview from a C-suite vantage point of the role. Virtualitics sponsor this episode.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today is Richard Schak, Senior Technical Account Manager, and Fraud Product Strategy Consultant at Datavisor. In this week’s episode, Richard discusses two key topics: how payment processing fraud is detected with AI and what these workflows look like before and after AI is applied. Richard also shares a specific perspective about where data and algorithms fit into the mix and emphasizes the importance of “lighthouse projects,” or the early projects that can be used to prove potential ROI to get leadership to approve larger projects and enable enterprises to level up fraud detection as a capability.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is episode four of five in our series, where we’re focusing on enterprise AI strategy. Our guest today is Adam Bonnifield. Adam is the CEO of Konux, an AI firm based in Germany. One of the key takeaways Adam emphasizes in this episode is that strategy is as much about what you’re not going to do as what you are going to do. He frames the processing of brainstorming about strategy and identifying opportunities in a way that focuses on the things that truly matter. Another critical point Adam makes is the benefit of addressing your enterprise’s existing problems rather than a novel application when it comes to strategy. Adam describes what this looked like within Airbus with lessons that are transferable to any other enterprise. Finally, we discuss the Trinity Model for AI ROI, a tool within Emerj Plus.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we dive back into our series on AI strategy and have two more days of episodes coming this week. Today’s guest is Sankar Narayanan, Chief Practice Officer at Fractal. Fractal is a unicorn company working on AI-related projects across industries and is well-known for its work in CPG and several other sectors. In this episode, Sankar explores three critical topics in great depth: finding the correct problems, having a long-term mindset, and building with the user in mind. In particular, being able to consider a less successful project and work backward to create a new process with a much larger likelihood of a user taking it, running with it, and converting it into ROI is one of the most salient points for this interview. He also emphasizes that it’s not about whether the algorithm works or we have the data but whether someone will use it.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week we are diving into the topic of AI strategy with a new series devoted to exploring how to build an enterprise-wide AI strategy and align company efforts to optimize long-term ROI while still seeing an immediate return with leaders at top companies. To start the series, we welcome back David Carmona. David is the General Manager for Artificial Intelligence and Innovation at Microsoft. In this episode, David speaks about how Microsoft didn’t get its AI strategy quite right initially and what they learned from their approach. The critical takeaway he shares is educating leadership to bring everyone to a level of solid conceptual understanding of AI. He explains how this educational element became a crucial underpinning for how they turned things around and built a strategy that can help inform where they are going as a company.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Emmanuel Walckenaer, CEO of YSEOP. In this episode, we discuss two core questions: first, how are enterprise leaders measuring the success of AI programs that are being used to augment human productivity? The second question is about where humans fit in the loop. In other words, why are humans still critical for certain kinds of workflows and decision-making processes? Emmanuel discusses the concepts of accountability and transparency and how those themes fit into humans’ role as orchestrators of AI in the enterprise. He also gives his perspective on where he sees augmentation happen in the life sciences space while discussing several of YSEOP’s use-cases applicable in other industries.

He discusses two crucial topics in this particular episode. First, where can AI actually step in, interact with a customer, and not make it worse but potentially improve? Ian talks about some of those use-cases and how to identify them within a financial services institution. The second main topic Ian discusses is some of the challenges and how to identify where humans may offer a better experience and where it might make more sense to keep them in the loop, and what it will take to overcome that moving forward. Ian will soon join us on our other podcast called “The AI in Financial Services Podcast,” where we specifically focus on use-cases in that industry.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s guest is Stefan Boronea, Co-Founder and CTO of Proportunity. Based in London, Proportunity is a company that has raised over $170M. In this episode, we dive into the topic of where machine learning can add value in terms of accurately predicting the price of homes both now and in the future. Stefan highlights the kind of data and features that are important to understand the price of a home in the present and the future. Another critical idea he shares is about the future of the market when both buyers and sellers have access to vastly more accurate data on estimating and forecasting prices. He discusses these ideas from the standpoint of buying and selling houses and gives a perspective on how they may impact larger assets.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I hope that by the end of this episode of the AI in Industry podcast, you'll not only be able to hire better data scientists who will be a fit for your business problems and build better data science teams, but also pick the AI applications and use cases that you should bring into your business versus those that you shouldn't.</p> <p>This episode, we interview Brooke Wenig, the machine learning practice lead at Databricks. Databricks was founded by the folks who created Apache Spark. Those of you who are technically savvy with AI will be familiar with Apache Spark as an open source language for artificial intelligence and distributed computing.</p> <p>Wenig works with a lot of companies with Databricks. Databricks is now close to 700 folks and helps implement AI applications into, oftentimes, large enterprise environments. Wenig speaks with us this week about what to look for in an actual data scientist and how to find data science folks with the right skills to be able to communicate to business people, not just to work with models. What should people be capable of; how should they be capable of thinking? Hopefully, some of you will have better interview questions by the end of this podcast.</p> <p>In addition, we ask Brooke about what the value of covering the cutting edge applications of AI is, looking at what's working in industry.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Saying that your company does artificial intelligence might still have a slightly cool ring to it if you're talking to one of your peers at a conference, but it doesn't mean very much to venture capitalists today, who've been battered with machine learning and artificial intelligence in every pitch deck they've seen for the last three or four years.</p> <p>I wondered, from a venture capitalist perspective, what makes an AI company's value proposition actually strong? What is it that makes an AI startup actually seem like a company that maybe could use AI to really win in the market? Not just to be another company that says they're going to do it or says they are doing it, but where can it actually provide enough of that competitive edge to make a VC want to pull the trigger?</p> <p>Getting a grasp of the answer to that question seems pretty critical.</p> <p>This week, we speak with Tim Chang, partner at Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, California. Chang and I both spoke at the Trans Tech Conference, held every year in Silicon Valley, focused on wellness and health-related technologies.</p> <p>Chang talks about what it is about an AI company's pitch, product, and market that actually makes AI an enhancement to the business in a way that's compelling to someone who wants to invest potentially millions and millions of dollars.</p>]]></description>

They're speaking about what they can do, but in reality, the things that they're talking about, the capabilities won't be unlocked for maybe a year or more. These are just things on the technology road map, but people speak about them like they exist now.</p> <p>This week, we speak with Abinash Tripathy, founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Help Shift. They've raised upwards of $40,000,000 in the last six years to apply artificial intelligence to the future of <a href= "https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/artificial-intelligence-customer-service-current-future-applications/"> customer service</a>, and we speak about the hard challenges of <a href= "https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/chatbots-for-customer-service/"> chatbots</a> and conversational interfaces, as well as how long it's going to be until those are actually robust. This in opposition to how people at large companies might put out a press release touting their own chatbots that simply aren't capable of doing what they say they can to any meaningful degree.</p> <p>We also talk about where AI can augment and make a difference in existing customer service workflows.  Even if we can't have all-capable chatbots to handle <a href= "https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/ai-in-banking-analysis/">banking</a> or <a href= "https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/artificial-intelligence-in-insurance-trends/"> insurance</a> or <a href= "https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/artificial-intelligence-in-ecommerce-amazon-alibaba-jd-com/"> eCommerce</a> questions from people, where can AI easily slide it's way in and actually make a difference today? In this episode, we draw a firm line on where the technology currently stands.</p> <p>Overall, though, this episode is about the challenges of actually innovating in AI. We talk about why it really is the big companies that do a lot of the actual cutting edge breakthroughs of AI and why others are going to have to license those their technologies from large firms like Google and Amazon.</p> <p>We also discuss why companies maybe need to have a realistic expectation about where they can apply AI, as well as why actually innovating and coming up with new AI capabilities on their own might just be wholly unreasonable given their data, their company culture, and their density of AI talent.</p> <p>Read the full interview article on emerj.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Close to a year ago, we had an interview here on the AI in Industry podcast with Jeremy Barnes of Element AI. We visited their headquarters in Montreal, and we'd interviewed Yoshua Bengio a couple years before that. Jeremy had brought up one point in that interview that I really like and that transfers its way into this conversation, which is that businesses should think not just about being more efficient with artificial intelligence, but places where they can actually make a real difference in the bottom line for the company beyond shaving off some savings.</p> <p>In this week's episode, we focus on compliance and analyzing contracts. At first, one might think about such an application in terms of cost savings. We speak with Shiv Vaithyanathan, an IBM fellow and Chief Architect of Watson Compare & Comply, about the following:</p> <ul> <li>What's possible with AI when it comes to analyzing contracts, and, most importantly</li> <li>Where is the business upside for AI as it relates to contract analysis. How can we analyze contracts not just in a way that saves money, but that allows us to optimize our deals for revenue, for the likelihood that they'll go through?  What's that farther vision?</li> </ul>]]></description>

In addition to that, Alves talks with us about what has to happen to AI as a technology to become more accessible and within reach of existing enterprises. Knowing now all the points of friction for bringing AI into an existing business, he talks about the transition points that he thinks are going to have to happen over the course of the years ahead in order to make these technologies more accessible to companies.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A lot of machine learning applications in business can be boiled down to some form of decision support. There are big decisions like deciding whether or not to merge or acquire another company, and there might be smaller decisions like whether or not a tumor has enough traits that make it seem like it's worth a surgical procedure or if it's worth leaving alone.</p> <p>In this particular interview, we talk about the domain of decision support, specifically in tax and accounting. There are few firms that know more about tax and accounting than Ernst & Young, and there are few people at Ernst & Young who know more about artificial intelligence than Sharda Cherwoo. Cherwoo is a partner at EY, and she is also the Intelligent Automation Leader for the Americas division of its tax practice.</p> <p>Cherwoo talks about where decision support is being influenced by machine learning in accounting and tax today, the initial experimentation traction, and results. She also paints a picture of bigger decisions that might be automatable by machine learning software. The focus of this episode may be on tax and accounting, but here are transferable lessons for business leaders in all industries that revolve around how machine learning can help inform decisions made by human experts.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Episode Summary:</strong> This week we talk to Alejandro Giacometti, the data science lead at a company called EDITED, based in London. The company claims to help retailers with inventory optimization, and we speak with Alejandro about how artificial intelligence can be used to search the web for the product clusters and individual products of major retailers to help inform other retailers on what products might be popular.</p> <p>There are two primary takeaways from this episode. The first is the broad capability of monitoring the competition with artificial intelligence, something that can be applied across industries, not just in retail. The second is that EDITED is generating information from what is freely available on the web, and so it would seem their software doesn't require businesses to integrate it into inventory management systems in order to train the algorithm behind it.</p> <p>I'm not necessarily lauding the company; I haven't used their product nor read all of their case studies. That said, it's worth noting simply because its approach is fundamentally different than most AI vendors.</p> <p>Read the full interview article on emerj.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Some businesses are going to require a sea change in the way that their computation works and the kinds of computing power that they're leveraging to do what they need to do with artificial intelligence. Others might not need an upgrade in hardware in the near term to do what they want to do with AI.</p> <p>What's the difference? That's the question that we decided to ask today of Per Nyberg, Vice President of Market Development, Artificial Intelligence at Cray. Cray is known for the Cray-1 supercomputer, built back in 1975. Cray continues to work on hardware and has an entire division now dedicated to artificial intelligence hardware.

Recently we did a huge piece on <a href= "https://www.techemergence.com/artificial-intelligence-in-india/">AI in India</a>. We got to interview folks from the government and the bigger existing businesses, as well as a handful of people at the unicorns in Bangalore.</p> <p>One of those companies is Fractal Analytics.

Many of our readers are in the <a href= "https://www.techemergence.com/artificial-intelligence-retail/">retail space</a>, but CPG has some pretty curious AI use cases.</p> <p>This week, we interview Prashant Joshi, Head of AI and Machine Learning at Fractal Analytics, about the different applications of machine learning in the CPG sector: doing chemical tests or finding new buyer segments within existing groups of consumers to determine who is buying from a company and who is buying from competitors.</p> <p>Hopefully, for those in retail, this interview will not only highlight some of the interesting use cases of AI in the CPG world but also provide some ideas about winning market share from what some of the bigger CPG firms are doing with Fractal Analytics.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Episode Summary:</strong> In this episode of the podcast, we interview AIG’s Chief Data Science Officer, Dr. Nishant Chandra, about natural language processing (NLP) for internal and team communication. Dr. Chandra talks about how NLP can help with sharing documents with specific team members whose roles warrant viewing those documents.</p> <p>Instead of a broad memo that would go out across the company, a document could be transformed to a tailored message depending on the individual receiving it. For instance, a document could be presented in a digestible way to the executive team, but be distilled to contain fewer details for the technology team to make it relevant to them. How might NLP serve this summarization role for internal communications in the next 5 years?</p> <p>See the full interview article here: www.techemergence.com/nlp-text-summarization-team-communication</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Episode summary:</strong> In the heavy industry sector, the cost of unpredicted repairs or machine failures can be very expensive. For example: A cargo train with an engine failure in will incur costs from it’s own repairs, from the transit required to reach the broken down engine, and with holding up other trains and cargo in the process.</p> <p>Predictive maintenance has the potential to help businesses assess the condition of vehicles, equipment and parts in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. Using data collected by sensors on machines (including vibration, temperature, and more) heavy industry companies can potentially predict which machines or parts need imminent maintenance and which machines are least likely to breakdown.</p> <p>In this week’s episode, we speak with Will McGinnis, Chief Scientist of Predikto, a predictive maintenance software provider based in Atlanta. Will speaks with us about predictive maintenance applied for the improvement railways and trains equipment, and how companies in the railway sector can use predictive maintenance to coax out patterns in maintenance schedules and heavy equipment data.</p> <p>Interested readers can listen to the full interview with Will here:<a href= "https://www.techemergence.com/will-mcginnis-predikto-predictive-maintenance-trains-mobile-heavy-industry">https://www.techemergence.com/will-mcginnis-predikto-predictive-maintenance-trains-mobile-heavy-industry</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Episode summary:</strong> This week’s episode explores the current possibilities in applying natural language processing for legal contract review. We speak with Andrew Antos and Nischal Nadhamuni from <a href="http://klaritylaw.com/">Klaritylaw</a>, a Boston-based startup focused on using natural language processing (NLP) based information extraction, from non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), in a live setting.</p> <p>We delve into the current and future roles of AI and lawyers with respect to legal contracts. AI is currently being applied in applications like retroactive analysis and information identification in legal documents. According to Andrew and Nishchal, in the future we will see on-the-fly legal content creation from AI tools and NLP being applied to most commercial contracting. Although, one restraint that AI companies presently face in the legal domain is the lack of access to huge amounts of publicly available data.</p> <p>You can listen to the full interview with Andrew and Nischal here:</p> <div id="titlediv"> <div class="inside"> <div id="edit-slug-box" class="hide-if-no-js"><span id= "sample-permalink"><a href= "https://www.techemergence.com/applying-ai-legal-contracts-whats-possible-now/"> https://www.techemergence.com/applying-ai-legal-contracts-whats-possible-now/</a></span> ‎</div> </div> </div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expert systems and machine learning are two ends of a spectrum working to solve similar problems quite differently. One one hand you have if-then scenarios and a logical approach, and on the other you have vast neural networks and a big data approach.

They hope to find a middle ground of sorts, one that mitigates their individual disadvantages. One such company is Montreal’s fuzzy.ai.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we interview its founder, Evan Prodromou about the state of the middle ground, so-called hybrid systems. The middle ground is an elusive, still mostly theoretical concept, but businesses can take steps to prepare for when it becomes accessible to them. What exactly would a hybrid system provide to businesses in terms of automation? How accessible are they now, and what can businesses do to best integrate them when they’re ready?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, discover how chatbots and conversational agents can provide you an advantage in the realms of customer support, product, support, lead engagement, and more, and learn the theory behind creating useful chatbots you can use in your own business. Right now, if we intend to find a piece of information or purchase something on the Internet, we might use a search engine that provides us with a list of sites we can browse in order to find ourselves a resolution for that intent. This week’s guest, Chief Scientist at Conversica, Dr. Sid J Reddy, talks about how AI and ML can usher in the next a new era of search software, one that will bring you a faster, more accurate resolution to your intent.</p> <p>Most importantly, Dr. Reddy discusses how chatbot technology can be integrated into areas such as customer service, product support, and lead engagement. By the end of the episode, listeners will have a better idea of the importance of collecting data and how they can use that data to  to build chatbot templates they can use in multiple domains and applications.</p> <p>For more interviews on the business applications of AI, visit:</p> <p><a href= "http://www.TechEmergence.com">www.TechEmergence.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence is coming - should be worried about our jobs? Well, it depends. Our guest Dr. Kevin LaGrandeur spent the last two years researching the impacts of automation and artificial intelligence on society and the job market. In this interview on <em>AI in Industry</em>, we explore the near future of AI's impact on the world of work, and I ask Kevin some important questions, including:</p> <ul> <li>What skills are least "automate-able" in the next decade?</li> <li>What middle class professions have the greatest risk of automation, and what should those professionals be doing now to hedge against job loss?</li> <li>What should business leaders be doing now to prepare for "phasing out" work while still taking care of their employees?</li> </ul> <p>For more interviews with AI executives and researchers (and more insight on applying AI in your organization) - visit us online at:</p> <p><a href= "http://www.TechEmergence.com">www.TechEmergence.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<title>Might AI Need Standards to Scale? - with Konstantinos Karachalios of the IEEE</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Though we don't think about it on a daily basis - the technologies around us often "work" because of an underlying standard that they depend on. These technologies include: Wifi, ethernet, fax, and much of the internet itself. Do certain AI applications need their own set of standards in order to scale?</p> <p>Imagine if you needed a new type of cable or input every time you wanted to jack your computer into the wall? Imagine if you needed different hardware to pick up wifi in every location you moved around to? Imagine if all websites had totally different protocols for how they were loaded or served to your computer? If this were the case, it would be extremely challenging for a robust "ecosystem" of internet companies and technologies to emerge, because the technology wouldn't scale or work well at all.</p> <p>This week we interview Konstantinos Karachalios,‎ Managing Director of the Standards Association at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Konstantinos holds a PhD in Physical and previously worked for 25 years at the European Patent Office. He speaks with us this week about the kinds of AI standards that may need to arise in order for AI to be safe and trusted enough to support a business ecosystem.</p> <p>Konstantinos also speaks to us about some of the current AI standards that IEEE is working on developing currently, and the implications they might have businesses everywhere.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A huge percentage of digital advertising dollars today go to Google and Facebook, who dominate that sector - and are inevitably central for the future of programmatic advertising. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that the growth in digital advertising in the last two to three years has gone almost entirely into their coffers. At least for the foreseeable future, Facebook and Google will retain the ability to dominate that space.</p> <p>The ability to be able to bid for the attention of particular target audiences, whether they’re searching for a specific term, live in a specific place or they like a specific sports team, is something that doesn’t seem to be going away, and seems to be rather efficient, thanks in the large part to Artificial Intelligence.</p> <p>In this episode we talk to Lior Tasman who is the CEO of PredictiveBid, an Israeli-based predictive advertising optimization start-up. The team focuses on applying AI to some of the bigger issues in programmatic advertising to help draw out more ROI from ads.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Marshall Brain discusses how wetware (the human brain) is increasingly becoming a part of a bigger system which may in itself be managed by software systems. The roles and relationships of humans and machines are rapidly changing. With the increasing advances in technology, there are fewer and fewer skills or activities that an enterprise needs from human beings, and they only need those until they can be replaced by software or hardware.</p> <p>For example, computer vision systems are often still not as effective as the human eye, so we still need human vision systems to recognize text or to recognize object placement, and take action accordingly (in a store, warehouse, or other setting). A human can fill that role as a piece of wetware until the software or the hardware catches up. How will man and machine collaborate in the future? We explore these dynamics in depth in this week's interview.</p> <p>For more interviews and insights from leading thinkers in AI and automation, visit:</p> <p><a href="techemergence.com">www.TechEmergence.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud attacks have become much more sophisticated. Account takeovers are happening more often. Many security attacks involve multiple methods and unexpected attacks can devastate businesses in just a few days, as we saw with Neiman Marcus and Target. False promotion and abuse is seen not only on social media sites but is also targeted at business. To combat these risks, fraud solutions need to be smarter to keep pace with fraudsters to prevent attacks and react quickly when they do happen. This requires a fast-learning solution with the ability to continually evolve. In this episode we talk to Kevin Lee from Sift Science and examine the shifts in the info security landscape over the past ten or fifteen year.

The heavy industry leaders of today are no farther behind automakers in their understanding that AI and automation will be essential for the future of their companies. In this episode, guest Dr. Sam Kherat discusses the areas in heavy industry where AI is currently playing a role in heavy industry, what type of capabilities and functions are automatable, and at what level. He also shines a light on how AI might affect the future of the industry within the next 2-3 years, and in what ways we can expect large equipment to become more autonomous.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If there's any industry ripe for disruption by AI and ML applications, it's healthcare. This week, we speak with <a href= "http://www.eleventwocap.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener noreferrer">ElevenTwo Capital</a>'s Founder and Managing Partner Shelley Zhuang, whose investment focus (among other spaces) is on innovative healthcare services. In addition to discussion how AI is helping propel genomics, diagnostics, therapeutic treatment, and other innovations, she touches on what the healthcare space might look like in the next 10 years. For healthcare startups looking to break into the healthcare market, Zhuang doesn't pretend to have simple answers; however, she identifies commonalities among companies that have been successful in smart preparation for meeting regulatory and other industry considerations. This interview was recorded live in San Francisco at Re-Work's Machine Intelligence in Autonomous Vehicles Summit in March 2017.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most clear insights from our recent consensus in marketing and advertising was that companies who have more digital touch points along the path to conversion—and more conversion in general—have an advantage when applying AI and ML technologies. In this week's episode, <a href="http://scopely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scopely</a> Co-Founder Ankur Bulsara shines a light on this dynamic and describes how gaming companies are taking advantage of digital trails and applying machine learning technologies. We don't cover much gaming on the TechEmergence podcast, so this interview is a bit off the beaten path. Bulsara speaks about how dialed-in and instrumented the mobile gaming environment is and how data is used to leverage higher conversions over time, as well as how Scopely's systems are set in place to ensure success of their business model. We think his insights on how gaming companies leverage higher conversions with (and without) machine learning can serve as an analogy for companies in other industries that are considering how to set in place similar, optimal digital processes over time.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm always a little shocked when I see how much venture investing goes into the healthcare space, which brings me to the subject of this week's episode: just how the healthcare industry is (and isn't) being impacted by innovations in AI technology. Guest Steve Gullans of Boston-Based <a href= "http://www.excelvm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excel Venture Management</a> talks about some of the various healthcare-related ML and AI applications that he sees being brought to light, and touches on which innovations have a better chance of getting blocked and redirected by parties of interest and those that have more promise in being accepted and rolled out sooner.

In this episode we're joined by Li Jiang, a venture capitalist with <a href= "http://gsvcap.com/">GSV Capital</a> whom I was connected with through Bootstrap Labs as a pre-event interview — we'll both be at Bootstrap Labs' Applied AI event in San Francisco on May 11. This week, Jiang speaks about the current areas of AI applications that he sees driving value in business, as well as what technologies he believes will make a long-term impact in terms of automation. His insights on where AI automations are generating cost savings and increased efficiency, as well as what roles might be completely replaced or significantly augmented by AI, are useful nuggets for companies who are thinking through some of their own business processes and are eager to identify low-hanging fruit.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As it turns out, survival of the fittest applies as much to algorithms as it does to amoebas, at least when we're talking about genetic algorithms. We recently interviewed Dr. Jay Perrret, CTO of Aria Networks, a company that uses genetic algorithm-based technology for solving some of industry's toughest problems, from optimization of business networks to pinpointing genetic patterns correlated with specific diseases. Dr. Perrett has been working for years in this domain, testing algorithms that use variations of parameters in order to gradually arrive at a best result, when there's no simple way to program a solution. In this episode, Dr. Perrett discusses how genetic algorithms (GA) work and ways that they can be tested and applied in a business context. He provides two very useful case studies, including a recent example with Facebook that involved planning out an optimal (and massive) data network.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

In this episode, we speak with the CTO and Co-Founder of one such company—Palo Alto-based Cloudera. CTO Amr Awadallah, PhD, speaks with us this week about where he sees "data lakes" (or "data hubs", Cloudera's preferred term) and warehouses play an important role in ML applications in business.

			<title>How to Raise Money for Your AI Startup – with Ben Narasin of Canvas Ventures</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, recorded live at Canvas Ventures in Portola Valley, I speak with Ben Narasin, a partner with Canvas and an avid venture <a href= "http://techemergence.com/investing-in-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor in AI and ML companies</a>, some of which we've interviewed (Crowdflower and Mulesoft), along with many others that we haven't (like Siri). Ben doesn't look for AI to invest in; instead, he looks for companies to invest in, a subtle but important difference in a business world increasingly caught up in the explosion of AI and ML technologies.</p> <p>From investments in Nuance to more recent one such as Houzz, Narasin has solid ideas as to what makes an investment interesting when AI is involved, what might actually add value to a model with AI, and what's wholly irrelevant when it comes to overall business model. Besides making important distinctions on where investments can make a return and how to raise money for your AI startup, this interview is also chock full of great analogies (give me golden dragons all day long—anyone?)</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Uday Veeramachaneni is taking a new approach to machine learning in infosecurity, AKA infosec. Traditionally, infosec has approached predicting attacks in two ways: through a system of hand-designed rules, and through anomaly detection, a technique that detects statistical outliers in the data. The problem with these approaches, Veermachaneni says, is that the signal-to-noise ratio is too low. In this episode, Veermachaneni discusses how his company, <a href="https://www.patternex.com/">PatternEx</a>, is using machine learning to provide more accurate attack prediction. He also discusses the cooperative role of man and machine in building robust <a href= "http://techemergence.com/artificial-intelligence-and-security-applications/"> AI applications in data security</a> and walks us through a common security attack scenario.</p>]]></description>

Not only is Kulkarni one of a small subsegment of the global population with an advanced degree in data science who has also been hired to work in tech companies like eBay, but he's been on the unique side hiring of ML and AI talent. Today, Kulkarni works full-time as Head of Data Science at Hired, Inc., a giant platform for hiring top talent in tech and other areas. In this episode, he provide an interesting distinction between what individuals with experience in data science look for in potential hires versus those who do not have the tech background tend to look for, and also dives into the supply-and-demand landscape for data scientists now and in the future—an interesting interview for anyone looking to hire or be hired in the ML and AI space.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In many ways, AI and finance are made for each other. Machine learning and other techniques make it easier to identify patterns that might otherwise not be detected by the human eye, and finance is quantitative to begin with so that it’s hard not to find traction.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Market research and trends is important when discussing AI and business, but it's also worthwhile to contemplate the ethical and social implications further down the line. How will countries deal with potential unemployment problems? How might countries collaborate to hedge against the risks that AI poses to the future of work and other economic facets? A relatively small group is helping people do just that i.e. getting organizations and countries to think through how they could hedge against the grander risks inherent in a world powered by AI.</p> <p class="p1">In this episode, we speak with Jerome Glenn, head of the Millennium Project, an initiative that focuses on research implementing the organizational means, operational priorities, and financing structures necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals or (MDGs). Glenn talks about how he gets principalities of the world to bring their big industrial players and the public to talk through possible scenarios that are 30, 40, even 50 years in the future, and about ways we might potentially hedge against risks and make the most of the upsides of AI in a global economy.</p>]]></description>

Theres’a good likelihood that if you're reading this interview, that you're already familiar with OpenAI, an organization with the sole purpose of ensuring that the future of man and machines is a friendly one, and that the concentration of power and intelligence isn’t centralized in a way that would make AI a dangerous tool. In this episode, we speak with Ilya Sutskever, research director for Open AI. This was a fun but frustrating interview; Sutskever held his cards close to his chest, but we gain some perspective on what he considers to be areas of importance regarding the future of AI and considerations for safely furthering advances in the field.</p>]]></description>

Solving this problem in applications of machine vision is something that CEO Igal Raichelgauz and his team are working on at Cortica, a machine learning company that is <em>not</em> focused on deep learning, but is instead taking a more "shallow" approach. In this episode, Raichelgauz articulates Cortica's approach, which is based on neurology and goes against some of the current approaches in getting machines to learn.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What does the world look like when we can replicate human expertise in an assistant? Are we close to developing human-level chatbots that we can ask about law or medical conditions? We dive into this topic with Founder and CEO of exClone Dr. Riza Berkan, whose personal assistant and chat-bot company is leveraging day-to-day human conversational templates in machine learning technology in order to better approach the tough task of replicating human expertise through a machine. Berkan talks about the edge layer of his company's “secret sauce”, and touches on the future applications of what might manifest in this field in 5 to 10 years in medical and other consumer applications.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For some companies, big data remains an abstraction; for others, it's an integral part of the lifeblood of a business. Mat Harris is vice president at Sojern, a travel marketing platform that has leveraged big data to grow $3 billion in bookings and 1/3 of a billion traveler profiles across its platform. In this episode, Harris speaks about how Sojern and other businesses are using a combination of their data and other sources of data (what he calls third and "second" data sources) in order to make informed marketing decisions and better market their services to buyers. Harris sheds light on the direct ROI for big data in different businesses, and it's an interesting episode from the perspective of an executive who is using big data to make decisions on business directions.</p>]]></description>

For some researchers, it may be quite possible to create an intelligent machine ‘in a box’, something without physical embodiment but with a powerful mind. Others believe general intelligence requires interaction with the outside world, inferring information from gestures and other features of functioning in an environment. Dr. Vincent Müller is of the belief that intelligence may involve more than just mental algorithms and may need to include the capacity to sense rather than just run a program. Vincent focuses on cognitive systems as an approach to AI, and in this episode he talks about what this means and implies, how this approach is different from classical AI, and what this might permit in the future if the field is developed.</span></p>]]></description>

I’ll have my cell growth rate here, heart rate here… you know… something fantastic.”As it turns out, the technology some of the best labs are using to extract data from biology has – at least in some respects – stayed the safe for half a century.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As far back as Homer's Illiad (and beyond), man has written about creating autonata to do the tasks we don't want to do. Generally, this is the dull, the dirty, and the dangerous work that no human would want to do. Interestingly, in most - if not all - of the historical examples of robot and android servants, they turn against their creators and lead to their downfall. Coincidence? Is this an engrained fear in the human psyche, beyond the effects of culture?</p> <p>Dr. Kevin LaGrandeur "wrote the book" on the history of our thinking about android servants, and sheds some fascinating light on how these historical perspective may influence and even define our perspectives on robots and androids today. Tune in!</p>]]></description>

Jeff Orkin is a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from MIT, and co-founder of GiantOtter, a technology company built around Jeff's own work at MIT - where he took the data from real people playing "roles" in video games, and used that data (rather than some pre-programmed notions or ideas of his own) to create virtual "characters" to interact with. In this interview we talk about the future of Jeff's own innovations, as well as the progression and proliferation of artificial intelligence itself.</p>]]></description>

In this interview, we talk about the founding of the Startup team, Massimiliano's advice to keeping a diverse team cohesive, and his predictions for the ramifications of robotics and "telepresence" in society and work. Some notable quotes: "People will drive to work less often, and 'beam' to work more often," "People will not do dull tasks, they will be robot managers." Needless to say, it gets interesting.</p>]]></description>
