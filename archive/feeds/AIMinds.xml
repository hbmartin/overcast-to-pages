        <![CDATA[<p>Samuel Pearton, Chief Marketing Officer at Polyhedra. Polyhedra Network is building foundational infrastructure for trust and scalability in AI and blockchain systems to enable secure, verifiable, high-performance applications. Led by a world-class team of engineers, researchers and business leaders from institutions such as UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Tsinghua University, Polyhedra’s deep expertize in zero-knowledge proofs and distributed systems underpins the development of our technical solutions.</p><p>Samuel Pearton is the Chief Marketing Officer at Polyhedra, driving the future of intelligence through its pioneering, high-performance technology. Drawing on decades of experience in tech, global marketing, and cross-cultural social commerce, Samuel understands that trust, scalability, and verifiability are essential to AI and blockchain.</p><p>Before officially joining Polyhedra’s executive team in October 2024, he played a key advisory role as the company secured $20 million in strategic funding at a $1 billion valuation. Prior to Polyhedra, Samuel founded PressPlay, a social commerce and engagement platform that connected athletes and celebrities—including Stephen Curry—with China’s fan economy.</p><p>Episode Highlights:<br>- Samuel shares his unique journey—from being an out-of-work musician in Australia to launching a startup in China focused on monetizing celebrity IP through digital channels. His early work with high-profile names like Steph Curry and Cristiano Ronaldo laid the foundation for his pivot into tech innovation.</p><p>- Samuel introduces Polyhedra and its mission to build infrastructure for verifiable AI using ZKML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning). The tech uses cryptographic proofs to ensure that AI models operate correctly and haven’t been tampered with—a critical guardrail as AI agents become more integrated into daily life.</p><p>- Samuel compares their technology to a seatbelt for AI—not always visible, but absolutely essential. ZKML acts as a mathematical "truth layer" that ensures the outputs of an AI model are trustworthy, especially in high-risk sectors like finance, healthcare, and robotics.</p><p>- Though many of the threats ZKML protects against haven’t materialized at scale yet, Samuel emphasizes the proactive nature of Polyhedra's mission. He highlights future use cases like AI agents making financial decisions or running household robots, where tamper-proof verification will be essential.</p><p>- Samuel gives a shoutout to Deepgram, which is collaborating with Polyhedra to develop verifiable voice applications.

It supports full orchestration, escalations, and integration with channels like Teams and WhatsApp.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br>Connect with Ilan Avner:<br>https://voiceaiconnect.audiocodes.com/<br>https://www.audiocodes.com/solutions-products/saas/audiocodes-live-hub</p><p>Connect with Demetrios:<br>https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</p><p>Connect with Deepgram:<br>https://deepgram.com/<br>https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepgram<br>https://twitter.com/deepgramai<br>https://www.facebook.com/deepgram/</p><p>Join the Deepgram Discord Server!<br>https://discord.com/invite/xWRaCDBtW4</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Eliott Hoffenberg, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Vocca. Vocca helps medical clinics run 24/7 by automating their phone reception with AI.</p><p>It handles scheduling, triage, follow-ups, and patient prep through smart inbound and outbound calls. Thousands of providers use Vocca to reduce costs, save time, and deliver instant service—without the wait. </p><p>Episode Highlights:<br>- Eliott explains how his company builds AI voice agents to automate inbound and outbound calls for clinics—handling scheduling, prep instructions, follow-ups, and more. Voice is still the dominant channel in healthcare, and automation addresses staff shortages and inefficiencies.</p><p>- Rather than aiming for overly chatty or expressive bots, the team focuses on clear, predictable behavior. Patients trust the agent not because it feels human, but because it’s reliable, accurate, and always available—key in high-stakes healthcare settings.</p><p>- Instead of building just a voice layer on top of other systems, Eliott’s team takes a vertical approach—owning everything from telephony to intent classification to EHR integration. This control lets them move faster, ship safer, and serve complex healthcare needs.</p><p>- Many patients don’t realize they’re talking to AI. Eliott stresses that determinism + thoughtful design create reliable, familiar-feeling conversations. Sometimes, less AI is better if it improves trust and clarity.</p><p>- Eliott sees healthcare as 50% diagnosis, 50% communication. His vision is to build 24/7 AI receptionists that manage everything outside of clinical care—empowering patients and streamlining operations without needing a doctor for every question.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br>Connect with Eliott Hoffenberg:<br>https://vocca.ai/<br>https://x.com/eliotthoff<br>https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliott-hoffenberg/</p><p>Connect with Demetrios:<br>https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</p><p>Connect with Deepgram:<br>https://deepgram.com/<br>https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepgram<br>https://twitter.com/deepgramai<br>https://www.facebook.com/deepgram/</p><p>Join the Deepgram Discord Server!<br>https://discord.com/invite/xWRaCDBtW4</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Daniel Mishler, Head of Automation at Deepgram. Deepgram is Voice AI platform for enterprise use cases – speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech APIs for developers.</p><p>Episode Highlights:<br>- Daniel pivoted from naval architecture in the Coast Guard to business through an MBA, then jumped into tech by working on synthetic aperture radar satellites—despite knowing nothing about them at first. His curiosity and growth mindset drove his success.</p><p>- Daniel reframes automation as augmentation, emphasizing AI should empower people, not replace them. His goal at Deepgram as Head of Automation is to make the company the most productive and efficient using AI tools, while being realistic about the cultural and technical challenges.</p><p>- Daniel credits tools like Cursor and Windsurf with changing his life. Despite no formal coding background and 10 kids at home, he used AI agents to start building. He stresses the importance of starting with a clear PRD and iterating through conversation-first workflows—a process he calls Vibe Coding.</p><p>- He built a VS Code extension called Vibe Coder that lets users talk through their ideas, automatically generate a PRD, and then dictate code using Deepgram's transcription tech.

Sei AI builds cutting-edge, compliant AI agents that transform customer interactions while optimizing costs.</p><p>Their AI-powered voice agents automate support, sales, and activation/reminder calls—boosting customer satisfaction and revenue without increasing contact center expenses. Meanwhile, their QA agent ensures compliance by monitoring customer conversations for regulatory and policy violations, while also extracting deep customer insights.</p><p>Sei AI is already trusted by publicly listed and enterprise financial institutions across the US, UK, and APAC, setting a new standard for AI-driven compliance and customer engagement in the financial sector.</p><p>Episode Highlights<br>- Ram shared his extensive background in financial technology, from working at PayPal during its shift from monolith to microservices, to launching Transferwise (Wise) in Australia and New Zealand. His experience in compliance-heavy industries set the stage for Sei AI.<br>- Sei AI started with a focus on marketing compliance for financial institutions—ensuring that banks and fintech's adhered to CFPB’s UDAP regulations in their advertising. They later expanded into customer support quality assurance, helping financial firms monitor compliance across support calls, emails, and chats.<br>- Ram detailed how Sei AI leveraged its compliance expertise to build AI-powered voice agents for regulated financial institutions. Instead of just automating calls, Sei AI ensures regulatory guardrails are in place, preventing AI from making misleading statements or omitting required disclosures.<br>- Discussing AI pricing, Ram highlighted how variable costs in AI (LLM &amp; speech-to-text calls) make traditional SaaS pricing tricky. He explored strategies like enterprise licensing, amortizing variable costs, and outcome-based pricing—charging based on successful customer interactions rather than per API call.<br>- Sei AI uses an "AI readiness scorecard" to identify predictable, high-confidence use cases first.
