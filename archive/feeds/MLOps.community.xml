			<title><![CDATA[A Candid Conversation Around MCP and A2A // Rahul Parundekar and Sam Partee // #316 SF Live]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Demetrios, Sam Partee, and Rahul Parundekar unpack the chaos of AI agent tools and the evolving world of MCP (Model Context Protocol). With sharp insights and plenty of laughs, they dig into tool permissions, security quirks, agent memory, and the messy path to making agents actually useful.</p><p><br /></p><p>// Bio</p><p>Sam Partee</p><p>Sam Partee is the CTO and Co-Founder of Arcade AI. Previously a Principal Engineer leading the Applied AI team at Redis, Sam led the effort in creating the ecosystem around Redis as a vector database. He is a contributor to multiple OSS projects including Langchain, DeterminedAI, LlamaIndex and Chapel amongst others. While at Cray/HPE he created the SmartSim AI framework which is now used at national labs around the country to integrate HPC simulations like climate models with AI. </p><p><br /></p><p>Rahul Parundekar</p><p>Rahul Parundekar is the founder of AI Hero. He graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from USC Los Angeles in 2010, and embarked on a career focused on Artificial Intelligence. From 2010-2017, he worked as a Senior Researcher at Toyota ITC working on agent autonomy within vehicles.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Real-Time Forecasting Faceoff: Time Series vs. DNNs // MLOps Podcast #305 with Josh Xi, Data Scientist at Lyft.</p><p><br></p><p>Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter </p><p><br></p><p>// Abstract</p><p>In real-time forecasting (e.g. geohash level demand and supply forecast for an entire region), time series-based forecasting methods are widely adopted due to their simplicity and ease of training. This discussion explores how Lyft uses time series forecasting to respond to real-time market dynamics, covering practical tips and tricks for implementing these methods, an in-depth look at their adaptability for online re-training, and discussions on their interpretability and user intervention capabilities. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how time series forecasting can outperform DNNs, and how to effectively use time series forecasting for dynamic market conditions and decision-making applications.</p><p><br></p><p>// Bio</p><p>Josh is a data scientist from the Marketplace team at Lyft, working on forecasting and modeling of marketplace signals that power products like pricing and driver incentives. Josh got his PHD in Operations Research in 2013, with minors in Statistics and Economics. Prior to joining Lyft, he worked as a research scientist in the Operations Research Lab at General Motors, focusing on optimization, simulation and forecasting modeling related to vehicle manufacturing, supply chain and car sharing systems.</p><p><br></p><p>// Related Links</p><p>Website: https://www.lyft.com/</p><p>Real-Time Spatial Temporal Forecasting @ Lyft blog: https://eng.lyft.com/real-time-spatial-temporal-forecasting-lyft-fa90b3f3ec24</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join our slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Josh on LinkedIn: /joshxiaominxi</p>

This discussion explores how Lyft uses time series forecasting to respond to real-time market dynamics, covering practical tips and tricks for implementing these methods, an in-depth look at their adaptability for online re-training, and discussions on their interpretability and user intervention capabilities. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how time series forecasting can outperform DNNs, and how to effectively use time series forecasting for dynamic market conditions and decision-making applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;// Bio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josh is a data scientist from the Marketplace team at Lyft, working on forecasting and modeling of marketplace signals that power products like pricing and driver incentives. Josh got his PHD in Operations Research in 2013, with minors in Statistics and Economics. Prior to joining Lyft, he worked as a research scientist in the Operations Research Lab at General Motors, focusing on optimization, simulation and forecasting modeling related to vehicle manufacturing, supply chain and car sharing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;// Related Links&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: https://www.lyft.com/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Spatial Temporal Forecasting @ Lyft blog: https://eng.lyft.com/real-time-spatial-temporal-forecasting-lyft-fa90b3f3ec24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join our slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect with Josh on LinkedIn: /joshxiaominxi&lt;/p&gt;

This strategic nuance has led to two patterns that suggest a maturation of the AI conversation across industries.

Second, conversations are shifting to emphasize market differentiation. That is, anyone can build products that wrap around LLMs. In competitive markets, creating products and functionality that all your competitors can also build is a poor business strategy (unless having a particular thing is industry standard).

He explores AI’s role in job interviews, personalized AI assistants, and the evolving nature of human-computer interaction. Key topics include AI-driven self-analysis, context-aware AI systems, and the impact of AI on optimizing human decision-making. The conversation highlights how AI can enhance creativity, collaboration, and efficiency by reducing cognitive load and making intelligent suggestions in real time.</p><p><br></p><p>// Bio</p><p>Fausto Albers is a relentless explorer of the unconventional—a techno-optimist with a foundation in sociology and behavioral economics, always connecting seemingly absurd ideas that, upon closer inspection, turn out to be the missing pieces of a bigger puzzle. He thrives in paradox: he overcomplicates the simple, oversimplifies the complex, and yet somehow lands on solutions that feel inevitable in hindsight. He believes that true innovation exists in the tension between chaos and structure—too much of either, and you’re stuck.His career has been anything but linear. He’s owned and operated successful restaurants, served high-stakes cocktails while juggling bottles on London’s bar tops, and later traded spirits for code—designing digital waiters, recommender systems, and AI-driven accounting tools. Now, he leads the AI Builders Club Amsterdam, a fast-growing community where AI engineers, researchers, and founders push the boundaries of intelligent systems.Ask him about RAG, and he’ll insist on specificity—because, as he puts it, discussing retrieval-augmented generation without clear definitions is as useful as declaring that “AI will have an impact on the world.” An engaging communicator, a sharp systems thinker, and a builder of both technology and communities, Fausto is here to challenge perspectives, deconstruct assumptions, and remix the future of AI.</p><p><br></p><p>// Related Links</p><p>Website: aibuilders.club</p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExploreJoin our slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkmConnect with Fausto on LinkedIn: /stepintoliquid</p>

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

// Bio

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Re-Platforming Your Tech Stack // MLOps Podcast #281 with Michelle Marie Conway, Lead Data Scientist at Lloyds Banking Group and Andrew Baker, Data Science Delivery Lead at Lloyds Banking Group.

// Abstract
Lloyds Banking Group is on a mission to embrace the power of cloud and unlock the opportunities that it provides. Andrew, Michelle, and their MLOps team have been on a journey over the last 12 months to take their portfolio of circa 10 Machine Learning models in production and migrate them from an on-prem solution to a cloud-based environment. During the podcast, Michelle and Andrew share their reflections as well as some dos (and don’ts!) of managing the migration of an established portfolio.

// Bio
Michelle Marie Conway
Michelle is a Lead Data Scientist in the high-performance data science team at Lloyds Banking Group. With deep expertise in managing production-level Python code and machine learning models, she has worked alongside fellow senior manager Andrew to drive the bank's transition to the Google Cloud Platform. Together, they have played a pivotal role in modernising the ML portfolio in collaboration with a remarkable ML Ops team.

Originally from Ireland and now based in London, Michelle blends her technical expertise with a love for the arts. 

Andrew Baker
Andrew graduated from the University of Birmingham with a first-class honours degree in Mathematics and Music with a Year in Computer Science and joined Lloyds Banking Group on their Retail graduate scheme in 2015.

Since 2021 Andrew has worked in the world of data, firstly in shaping the Retail data strategy and most recently as a Data Science Delivery Lead, growing and managing a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. He has built a high-performing team responsible for building and maintaining ML models in production for the Consumer Lending division of the bank.

Andrew is motivated by the role that data science and ML can play in transforming the business and its processes, and is focused on balancing the power of ML with the need for simplicity and explainability that enables business users to engage with the opportunities that exist in this space and the demands of a highly regulated environment.

<p>Holistic Evaluation of Generative AI Systems // MLOps Podcast #280 with Jineet Doshi, Staff AI Scientist or AI Lead at Intuit.

// Abstract
Evaluating LLMs is essential in establishing trust before deploying them to production. Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.

			<title><![CDATA[Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // Robert Caulk // #279]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em></em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Robert Caulk</em></a> is responsible for directing software development, enabling research, coordinating company projects, quality control, proposing external collaborations, and securing funding. He believes firmly in open-source, having spent 12 years accruing over 1000 academic citations building open-source software in domains such as machine learning, image analysis, and coupled physical processes. He received his Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.

Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.

// Abstract
Indexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.

The latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. 

We discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.

We conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.

// Bio
Robert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications. He is currently overseeing the structuring of hundreds of thousands of news articles per day in order to build the best news retrieval API in the world: https://asknews.app.

Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.

// Abstract
Indexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.

The latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. 

We discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.

We conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.

			<title><![CDATA[LLM Distillation and Compression // Guanhua Wang // #278]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guanhua-wang/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Guanhua Wang</em></a> is <em>a Senior Researcher</em> in DeepSpeed Team at <em>Microsoft</em>. Before <em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.

Domino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua "Alex" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.

// Abstract
Given the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.

// Bio

<p>AI's Next Frontier // MLOps Podcast #277 with Aditya Naganath, Principal at Kleiner Perkins.

// Abstract
LLMs have ushered in an unmistakable supercycle in the world of technology. The low-hanging use cases have largely been picked off. The next frontier will be AI coworkers who sit alongside knowledge workers, doing work side by side. At the infrastructure level, one of the most important primitives invented by man - the data center, is being fundamentally rethought in this new wave.

// Bio
Aditya Naganath joined Kleiner Perkins’ investment team in 2022 with a focus on artificial intelligence, enterprise software applications, infrastructure and security. Prior to joining Kleiner Perkins, Aditya was a product manager at Google focusing on growth initiatives for the next billion users team. He previously was a technical lead at Palantir Technologies and formerly held software engineering roles at Twitter and Nextdoor, where he was a Kleiner Perkins fellow. Aditya earned a patent during his time at Twitter for a technical analytics product he co-created.

Originally from Mumbai India, Aditya graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and an MBA from Stanford University. Outside of work, you can find him playing guitar with a hard rock band, competing in chess or on the squash courts, and fostering puppies. He is also an avid poker player.

// Abstract
Matt Van Itallie, founder and CEO of Sema, discusses how comprehensive codebase evaluations play a crucial role in MLOps and technical due diligence. He highlights the impact of Generative AI on code transparency and explains the Generative AI Bill of Materials (GBOM), which helps identify and manage risks in AI-generated code. This talk offers practical insights for technical and non-technical audiences, showing how proper diligence can enhance value and mitigate risks in machine learning operations.

// Bio
Matt Van Itallie is the Founder and CEO of Sema. He and his team have developed Comprehensive Codebase Scans, the most thorough and easily understandable assessment of a codebase and engineering organization. These scans are crucial for private equity and venture capital firms looking to make informed investment decisions. Sema has evaluated code within organizations that have a collective value of over $1 trillion. In 2023, Sema served 7 of the 9 largest global investors, along with market-leading strategic investors, private equity, and venture capital firms, providing them with critical insights.

In addition, Sema is at the forefront of Generative AI Code Transparency, which measures how much code created by GenAI is in a codebase. They are the inventors behind the Generative AI Bill of Materials (GBOM), an essential resource for investors to understand and mitigate risks associated with AI-generated code.

Before founding Sema, Matt was a Private Equity operating executive and a management consultant at McKinsey. He graduated from Harvard Law School and has had some interesting adventures, like hiking a third of the Appalachian Trail and biking from Boston to Seattle.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/berniewu/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Bernie Wu</em></a> is VP of Business Development for <a href="www.memverge.com" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>MemVerge</em></a>. He has 25+ years of experience as a senior executive for data center hardware and software infrastructure companies including companies such as Conner/Seagate, Cheyenne Software, Trend Micro, FalconStor, Levyx, and MetalSoft.

Boosting LLM/RAG Workflows &amp; Scheduling w/ Composable Memory and Checkpointing // MLOps Podcast #270 with Bernie Wu, VP Strategic Partnerships/Business Development of MemVerge.

// Abstract
Limited memory capacity hinders the performance and potential of research and production environments utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. This discussion explores how leveraging industry-standard CXL memory can be configured as a secondary, composable memory tier to alleviate this constraint.

We will highlight some recent work we’ve done in integrating of this novel class of memory into LLM/RAG/vector database frameworks and workflows. 

Disaggregated shared memory is envisioned to offer high performance, low latency caches for model/pipeline checkpoints of LLM models, KV caches during distributed inferencing, LORA adaptors, and in-process data for heterogeneous CPU/GPU workflows. We expect to showcase these types of use cases in the coming months.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gideon-mendels/ " target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Gideon Mendels</em></a> is the <em>Chief Executive Officer</em> at <a href="https://www.comet.com/site/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Comet</em></a>, the leading solution for managing machine learning workflows.

How to Systematically Test and Evaluate Your LLMs Apps // MLOps Podcast #269 with Gideon Mendels, CEO of Comet.

// Abstract
When building LLM Applications, Developers need to take a hybrid approach from both ML and SW Engineering best practices. They need to define eval metrics and track their entire experimentation to see what is and is not working. They also need to define comprehensive unit tests for their particular use-case so they can confidently check if their LLM App is ready to be deployed. 

// Bio
Gideon Mendels is the CEO and co-founder of Comet, the leading solution for managing machine learning workflows from experimentation to production. He is a computer scientist, ML researcher and entrepreneur at his core. Before Comet, Gideon co-founded GroupWize, where they trained and deployed NLP models processing billions of chats. His journey with NLP and Speech Recognition models began at Columbia University and Google where he worked on hate speech and deception detection.

How to Systematically Test and Evaluate Your LLMs Apps // MLOps Podcast #269 with Gideon Mendels, CEO of Comet.

// Abstract
When building LLM Applications, Developers need to take a hybrid approach from both ML and SW Engineering best practices. They need to define eval metrics and track their entire experimentation to see what is and is not working. They also need to define comprehensive unit tests for their particular use-case so they can confidently check if their LLM App is ready to be deployed. 

// Bio
Gideon Mendels is the CEO and co-founder of Comet, the leading solution for managing machine learning workflows from experimentation to production. He is a computer scientist, ML researcher and entrepreneur at his core. Before Comet, Gideon co-founded GroupWize, where they trained and deployed NLP models processing billions of chats. His journey with NLP and Speech Recognition models began at Columbia University and Google where he worked on hate speech and deception detection.

// Abstract
Like many companies, Picnic started out with a small, central data science team. As this grows larger, focussing on more complex models, it questions the skillsets &amp; organisational set up.

Use an ML platform, or build ourselves?
A central team vs. embedded?
Hire data scientists vs. ML engineers vs. MLOps engineers
How to foster a team culture of end-to-end ownership
How to balance short-term &amp; long-term impact

// Bio
Jelmer Borst
Jelmer leads the analytics &amp; machine learning teams at Picnic, an app-only online groceries company based in The Netherlands. Whilst his background is in aerospace engineering, he was looking for something faster-paced and found that at Picnic. He loves the intersection of solving business challenges using technology &amp; data. In his free time loves to cook food and tinker with the latest AI developments.

Daniela Solis Morales
As a Machine Learning Lead at Picnic, I am responsible for ensuring the success of end-to-end Machine Learning systems. My work involves bringing models into production across various domains, including Personalization, Fraud Detection, and Natural Language Processing.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fpingham/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Francisco Ingham</em></a>, LLM consultant, NLP developer, and founder of <a href="pampa.ai" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer"><em>Pampa Labs</em></a>.

Making Your Company LLM-native // MLOps Podcast #266 with Francisco Ingham, Founder of Pampa Labs.

// Abstract
Being an LLM-native is becoming one of the key differentiators among companies, in vastly different verticals. Everyone wants to use LLMs, and everyone wants to be on top of the current tech but - what does it really mean to be LLM-native?

LLM-native involves two ends of a spectrum. On the one hand, we have the product or service that the company offers, which surely offers many automation opportunities. LLMs can be applied strategically to scale at a lower cost and offer a better experience for users.

But being LLM-native not only involves the company's customers, it also involves each stakeholder involved in the company's operations. How can employees integrate LLMs into their daily workflows? How can we as developers leverage the advancements in the field not only as builders but as adopters?

We will tackle these and other key questions for anyone looking to capitalize on the LLM wave, prioritizing real results over the hype.

// Bio
Currently working at Pampa Labs, where we help companies become AI-native and build AI-native products. Our expertise lies on the LLM-science side, or how to build a successful data flywheel to leverage user interactions to continuously improve the product. We also spearhead, pampa-friends - the first Spanish-speaking community of AI Engineers.

Previously worked in management consulting, was a TA in fastai in SF, and led the cross-AI + dev tools team at Mercado Libre.

Unpacking 3 Types of Feature Stores // MLOps Podcast #265 with Simba Khadder, Founder &amp; CEO of Featureform.

// Abstract
Simba dives into how feature stores have evolved and how they now intersect with vector stores, especially in the world of machine learning and LLMs. He breaks down what embeddings are, how they power recommender systems, and why personalization is key to improving LLM prompts. Simba also sheds light on the difference between feature and vector stores, explaining how each plays its part in making ML workflows smoother. Plus, we get into the latest challenges and cool innovations happening in MLOps.

// Bio
Simba Khadder is the Founder &amp; CEO of Featureform. After leaving Google, Simba founded his first company, TritonML. His startup grew quickly and Simba and his team built ML infrastructure that handled over 100M monthly active users. He instilled his learnings into Featureform’s virtual feature store. Featureform turns your existing infrastructure into a Feature Store. He’s also an avid surfer, a mixed martial artist, a published astrophysicist for his work on finding Planet 9, and he ran the SF marathon in basketball shoes.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em></em><a href="linkedin.com/in/jonathanrx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Jonathan Rioux</em></a> is a Managing Principal of AI Consulting for <a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>EPAM Systems</em></a>, where he advises clients on how to get from idea to realized AI products with the minimum of fuss and friction.

Who&#39;s MLOps for Anyway? // MLOps Podcast #261 with Jonathan Rioux, Managing Principal, AI Consulting at EPAM Systems.

// Abstract
The year is 2024 and we are all staring into the cliff towards the abyss of disillusionment for Generative AI. Every organization, developer, and AI-adjacent individual is now talking about &quot;making AI real&quot; and &quot;turning a ROI on AI initiatives&quot;. MLOps and LLMOps are taking the stage as the solution; equip your AI teams with the best tools money can buy, grab tokens by the fistful, and look at value raking in.

Sounds familiar and eerily similar to the previous ML hype cycles?

From solo devs to large organizations, how can we avoid the same pitfalls as last time and get out of the endless hamster wheel?

// Bio
Jonathan is a Managing Principal of AI Consulting for EPAM, where he advises client on how to get from idea to realized AI products with the minimum of fuss and friction. He&#39;s obsessed with the mental models of ML and how to organize harmonious AI practices. Jonathan published &quot;Data Analysis with Python and PySpark&quot; (Manning, 2022).

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivabhattacharjee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Shiva Bhattacharjee</em></a> is the Co-founder and CTO of <a href="www.truelaw.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>TrueLaw</em></a>, where we are building bespoke models for law firms for a wide variety of tasks.

Alignment is Real // MLOps Podcast #260 with Shiva Bhattacharjee, CTO of TrueLaw Inc.

// Abstract
If the off-the-shelf model can understand and solve a domain-specific task well enough, either your task isn&#39;t that nuanced or you have achieved AGI. We discuss when is fine-tuning necessary over prompting and how we have created a loop of sampling - collecting feedback - fine-tuning to create models that seem to perform exceedingly well in domain-specific tasks.

// Bio
20 years of experience in distributed and data-intensive systems spanning work at Apple, Arista Networks, Databricks, and Confluent. Currently CTO at TrueLaw where we provide a framework to fold in user feedback, such as lawyer critiques of a given task, and fold them into proprietary LLM models through fine-tuning mechanics, resulting in 7-10x improvements over the base model.

// Abstract
Ax is a new way to build complex workflows with LLMs. It&#39;s a typescript library based on research done in the Stanford DSP paper. Concepts such as prompt signatures, prompt tuning, and composable prompts help you build RAG and agent-powered ideas that have till now been hard to build and maintain. Ax is designed for production usage.

// Bio
Vikram builds open-source software. Currently working on making it easy to build with LLMs. Created Ax a typescript library that abstracts over all the complexity of LLMs, it is based on the research done in the Stanford DSP paper. Worked extensively with LLMs over the last few years to build complex workflows. Previously worked as a senior software engineer with LinkedIn on Ad Serving.

Trust is paramount in the adoption of new technologies, especially in the realm of education. Mohamed and Mara shed light on the importance of AI governance programs and establishing AI governance boards to ensure safe and ethical use of technology while managing associated risks. They discuss the impact on customers, potential risks, and mitigation strategies that organizations must consider to protect their brand reputation and comply with regulations.

// Bio
Mara Pometti
Mara is an Associate Design Director at McKinsey &amp; Company, where she helps organisations drive AI adoption through human-centered methods. She defines herself as a data-savvy humanist. Her practice spans across AI, data journalism, and design with the overarching objective of finding the strategic intersection between AI models and human intents to implement responsible AI systems that move organisations forward. Previously, she led the AI Strategy practice at IBM, where she also developed the company’s first-ever data storytelling program. Yet, by background, she is a data journalist. She worked as a data journalist for agencies and newsrooms like Aljazeera. Mara lectured at many universities about how to humanize AI, including the London School of Economics. Her books and writing explore how to weave a humanistic approach to AI development.

Mohamed Abusaid
Am Mohamed, a tech enthusiast, hacker, avid traveler, and foodie all rolled into one individual. Built his first website when he was 9 and fell in love with computers and the internet ever since. Graduated with computer science from university although dabbled in electrical, electronic, and network engineering before that. When he&#39;s not reading up on the latest tech conversations and products on Hacker News, Mohamed spends his time traveling to new destinations and exploring their cuisine and culture. 

Mohamed works with different companies helping them tackle challenges in developing, deploying, and scaling their analytics to reach its potential. Some topics he&#39;s enthusiastic about include MLOps, DataOps, GenerativeAI, Product thinking, and building cross-functional teams to deliver user-first products.

Visualize - Bringing Structure to Unstructured Data // MLOps Podcast #258 with Markus Stoll, CTO of Renumics.

A huge thank you to <a href="https://www.sas.com/ja_jp/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>SAS</em></a> for their generous support! 

// Abstract
This talk is about how data visualization and embeddings can support you in understanding your machine-learning data. We explore methods to structure and visualize unstructured data like text, images, and audio for applications ranging from classification and detection to Retrieval-Augmented Generation. By using tools and techniques like UMAP to reduce data dimensions and visualization tools like Renumics Spotlight, we aim to make data analysis for ML easier. Whether you&#39;re dealing with interpretable features, metadata, or embeddings, we&#39;ll show you how to use them all together to uncover hidden patterns in multimodal data, evaluate the model performance for data subgroups, and find failure modes of your ML models.

// Bio
Markus Stoll began his career in the industry at Siemens Healthineers, developing software for the Heavy Ion Therapy Center in Heidelberg. He learned about software quality while developing a treatment machine weighing over 600 tons. He earned a Ph.D., focusing on combining biomechanical models with statistical models, through which he learned how challenging it is to bridge the gap between research and practical application in the healthcare domain. Since co-founding Renumics, he has been active in the field of AI for Engineering, e.g., AI for Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), implementing projects, contributing to their open-source library for data exploration for ML datasets (Renumics Spotlight) and writing articles about data visualization.

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps for GenAI Applications // Harcharan Kabbay // #256]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harcharankabbay/locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Harcharan Kabbay</em></a> is a Data Scientist &amp; AI/ML Engineer with Expertise in MLOps, Kubernetes, and DevOps, Driving End-to-End Automation and Transforming Data into Actionable Insights.</p>
<p>
MLOps for GenAI Applications // MLOps Podcast #256 with Harcharan Kabbay, Lead Machine Learning Engineer at World Wide Technology.

// Abstract
The discussion begins with a brief overview of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, highlighting its significance in enhancing AI capabilities by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models.

The podcast further explores the integration of MLOps, focusing on best practices for embedding the RAG framework into a CI/CD pipeline. This includes ensuring robust monitoring, effective version control, and automated deployment processes that maintain the agility and efficiency of AI applications.

A significant portion of the conversation is dedicated to the importance of automation in platform provisioning, emphasizing tools like Terraform. The discussion extends to application design, covering essential elements such as key vaults, configurations, and strategies for seamless promotion across different environments (development, testing, and production). We&#39;ll also address how to enhance the security posture of applications through network firewalls, key rotation, and other measures.

Let&#39;s talk about the power of Kubernetes and related tools to aid a good application design.

The podcast highlights the principles of good application design, including proper observability and eliminating single points of failure. I would share strategies to reduce development time by creating templates for GitHub repositories by application types to be re-used, also templates for pull requests, thereby minimizing human errors and streamlining the development process.

			<title><![CDATA[The Variational Book // Yuri Plotkin // #253]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/yuri-plotkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Yuri Plotkin</em></a> is a Biomedical Engineer and Machine Learning Scientist and the author of <a href="https://www.thevariationalbook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>The Variational Book</em></a>.</p>
<p>
The Variational Book // MLOps Podcast #253 with Yuri Plotkin, an ML Scientist.

// Abstract
Curiosity has been the underlying thread in Yuri&#39;s life and interests. With the explosion of Generative AI, Yuri was fascinated by the topic and decided he needed to learn more. Yuri pursued learning by reading, deriving, and understanding seminal papers within the last generation. The endeavors culminated in the writing of a book on the topic, The Variational Book, which Yuri expects to release shortly in the coming months. A bit of detail about the topics he covers can be found here: www.thevariationalbook.com.

// Bio
Evolved from biomedical engineer to wet-lab scientist, and more recently transitioned Yuri&#39;s career to computer science with the last 10+ years developing projects at the intersection of medicine, life sciences and machine learning. 
Yuri&#39;s educational background is in Biomedical Engineering, at Columbia University (M.S.) and University of California, San Diego (B.S.). Current interests include generative AI, diffusion models, and LLMs.

Harnessing AI APIs for Safer, Accurate, &amp; Reliable Applications // MLOps Podcast #252 with Ron Heichman, Machine Learning Engineer at SentinelOne.

// Abstract
Integrating AI APIs effectively is pivotal for building applications that leverage LLMs, especially given the inherent issues with accuracy, reliability, and safety that LLMs often exhibit. I aim to share practical strategies and experiences for using AI APIs in production settings, detailing how to adapt these APIs to specific use cases, mitigate potential risks, and enhance performance. The focus will be testing, measuring, and improving quality for RAG or knowledge workers utilizing AI APIs.

			<title><![CDATA[Balancing Speed and Safety // Panel // AIQCON]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a panel taken from the recent AI quality Conference presented by the MLOps Community and Kolena</p>
<p>// Abstract
The need for moving to production quickly is paramount in staying out of perpetual POC territory. AI is moving fast. Shipping features fast to stay ahead of the competition is commonplace. Quick iterations are viewed as strength in the startup ecosystem, especially when taking on a deeply entrenched competitor. Each week a new method to improve your AI system becomes popular or a SOTA foundation model is released. How do we balance the need for speed vs the responsibility of safety? Having the confidence to ship a cutting-edge model or AI architecture and knowing it will perform as tasked. What are the risks and safety metrics that others are using when they deploy their AI systems. How can you correctly identify when risks are too large?

			<title><![CDATA[Reliable LLM Products, Fueled by Feedback // Chinar Movsisyan // #251]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em></em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/movchinar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Chinar Movsisyan</em></a> is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.f6s.com/company/feedback-intelligence-formerly-manot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Feedback Intelligence (formerly Manot)</em></a>, an MLOps startup based in San Francisco. She has been in the AI field for more than 7 years from research labs to venture-backed startups.</p>
<p>
Reliable LLM Products, Fueled by Feedback // MLOps Podcast #250 with Chinar Movsisyan, CEO of Feedback Intelligence.

// Abstract
We live in a world driven by large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, but ensuring they are ready for real-world deployment is crucial. Despite the availability of numerous evaluation tools, many LLM products still struggle to make it to production.

We propose a new perspective on how LLM products should be measured, evaluated, and improved. A product is only as good as the user&#39;s experience and expectations, and we aim to enhance LLM products to meet these standards reliably.

Our approach creates a new category that automates the need for separate evaluation, observability, monitoring, and experimentation tools. By starting with the user experience and working backward to the model, we provide a comprehensive view of how the product is actually used, rather than how it is intended to be used. This user-centric aka feedback-centric approach is the key to every successful product.

// Bio
Chinar Movsisyan is the founder and CEO of Feedback Intelligence, an MLOps company based in San Francisco that enables enterprises to make sure that LLM-based products are reliable and that the output is aligned with end-user expectations. With over eight years of experience in deep learning, spanning from research labs to venture-backed startups, Chinar has led AI projects in mission-critical applications such as healthcare, drones, and satellites. Her primary research interests include artificial intelligence, generative AI, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. At Feedback Intelligence, Chinar and her team address a crucial challenge in LLM development by automatically converting user feedback into actionable insights, enabling AI teams to analyze root causes, prioritize issues, and accelerate product optimization. This approach is particularly valuable in highly regulated industries, helping enterprises to reduce time-to-market and time-to-resolution while ensuring robust LLM products. Feedback Intelligence, which participated in the Berkeley SkyDeck accelerator program, is currently expanding its business across various verticals.

			<title><![CDATA[AI Operations Without Fundamental Engineering Discipline // Nikhil Suresh // #250]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nik-suresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Nik Suresh</em></a> wrote an evisceration of the current AI hype boom called &quot;I Will F**king Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again.&quot;

AI Operations Without Fundamental Engineering Discipline // MLOps Podcast #250 with Nikhil Suresh, Director @ Hermit Tech.

// Abstract
Nik is on the podcast because of an anti-AI hype piece, so a reasonable thing to discuss is going to be what most companies are getting wrong when non-technical management wants to immediately roll out ML initiatives, but are unwilling to bring technical naysayers on board who will set them up for success.

// Bio
Nik is the author of ludic.mataroa.blog, who wrote &quot;I Will [REDACTED] Piledriver You If You Mention AI Again&quot;, and mostly works in the data engineering and data science spaces. Nik&#39;s writing and company both focus on bringing more care to work, pushing back against the industry&#39;s worst excesses both technically and spiritually, and getting fundamentals right.

Nik also has a reasonably strong background in psychology. His data science training was of the pre-LLM variety, circa. 2018, when there was a lot of hype but it wasn&#39;t this ridiculous.

			<title><![CDATA[All Data Scientists Should Learn Software Engineering Principles // Catherine Nelson // #245]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinenelson1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Catherine Nelson</em></a> is a freelance data scientist and writer. She is currently working on the forthcoming O’Reilly book &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Catherine-Nelson/dp/1098136209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Software Engineering for Data Scientists</em></a>”.

Why All Data Scientists Should Learn Software Engineering Principles // MLOps podcast #245 with Catherine Nelson, a freelance Data Scientist.

A big thank you to LatticeFlow AI for sponsoring this episode! LatticeFlow AI - <a href="https://latticeflow.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://latticeflow.ai/</a>

// Abstract
Data scientists have a reputation for writing bad code. This quote from Reddit sums up how many people feel: “It&#39;s honestly unbelievable and frustrating how many Data Scientists suck at writing good code.” But as data science projects grow, and because the job now often includes deploying ML models, it&#39;s increasingly important for DSs to learn fundamental SWE principles such as keeping your code modular, making sure your code is readable by other people and so on. The exploratory nature of DS projects means that you can&#39;t be sure where you will end up at the start of a project, but there&#39;s still a lot you can do to standardize the code you write.

// Bio

ML and AI as Distinct Control Systems in Heavy Industrial Settings // MLOps podcast #243 with Richard Howes, CTO of Metaformed. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardhowes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Richard Howes</a> is a dedicated engineer who is passionate about control systems whether it be embedded systems, industrial automation, or AI/ML in a business application.

Huge thank you to AWS for sponsoring this episode. AWS - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>

// Abstract
How can we balance the need for safety, reliability, and robustness with the extreme pace of technology advancement in heavy industry? The key to unlocking the full potential of data will be to have a mixture of experts both from an AI and human perspective to validate anything from a simple KPI to a Generative AI Assistant guiding operators throughout their day. The data generated by heavy industries like agriculture, oil &amp; gas, forestry, real estate, civil infrastructure, and manufacturing is underutilized and struggles to keep up with the latest and greatest - and for good reason. They provide the shelter we live and work in, the food we eat, and the energy to propel society forward. Compared to the pace of AI innovation they move slowly, have extreme consequences for failure, and typically involve a significant workforce. During this discussion, we will outline the data ready to be utilized by ML, AI, and data products in general as well as some considerations for creating new data products for these heavy industries. To account for complexity and uniqueness throughout the organization it is critical to engage operational staff, ensure safety is considered from all angles, and build adaptable ETL needed to bring the data to a usable state. 

// Bio
Richard Howes is a dedicated engineer who is passionate about control systems whether it be embedded systems, industrial automation, or AI/ML in a business application. All of these systems require a robust control philosophy that outlines the system, its environment, and how the controller should function within it. Richard has a bachelor&#39;s of Electrical Engineering from the University of Victoria where he specialized in industrial automation and embedded systems. Richard is primarily focused on the heavy industrial sectors like energy generation, oil &amp; gas, pulp/paper, forestry, real estate, and manufacturing. He works on both physical process control and business process optimization using the control philosophy principles as a guiding star.

Richard has been working with industrial systems for over 10 years designing, commissioning, operating, and maintaining automated systems. For the last 5 years, Richard has been investing time into the data and data science-related disciplines bringing the physical process as close as possible to the business taking advantage of disparate data sets throughout the organization. Now with the age of AI upon us, he is focusing on integrating this technology safely, reliably, and with distinct organizational goals and ROI.

Accelerating Multimodal AI // MLOps podcast #241 with Ethan Rosenthal, Member of Technical Staff of Runway.

Huge thank you to AWS for sponsoring this episode. AWS - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>

// Abstract
We’re still trying to figure out systems and processes for training and serving “regular” machine learning models, and now we have multimodal AI to contend with! These new systems present unique challenges across the spectrum, from data management to efficient inference. I’ll talk about the similarities, differences, and challenges that I’ve seen by moving from tabular machine learning, to large language models, to generative video systems. I’ll also talk about the setups and tools that I have seen work best for supporting and accelerating both the research and productionization process.

// Bio
Ethan works at Runway building systems for media generation. Ethan&#39;s work generally straddles the boundary between research and engineering without falling too hard on either side. Prior to Runway, Ethan spent 4 years at Square. There, he led a small team of AI Engineers training large language models for Conversational AI. Before Square, Ethan freelance consulted and worked at a couple ecommerce startups. Ethan found his way into tech by way of a Physics PhD.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Uber&#39;s Michelangelo: Strategic AI Overhaul and Impact // MLOps podcast #239 with Demetrios Brinkmann. 

Huge thank you to Weights &amp; Biases for sponsoring this episode. WandB Free Courses - <a href="http://wandb.me/courses_mlops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">http://wandb.me/courses_mlops</a>

// Abstract
Uber&#39;s Michelangelo platform has evolved significantly through three major phases, enhancing its capabilities from basic ML predictions to sophisticated uses in deep learning and generative AI. Initially, Michelangelo 1.0 faced several challenges such as a lack of deep learning support and inadequate project tiering. To address these issues, Michelangelo 2.0 and subsequently 3.0 introduced improvements like support for Pytorch, enhanced model training, and integration of new technologies like Nvidia’s Triton and Kubernetes. The platform now includes advanced features such as a Genai gateway, robust compliance guardrails, and a system for monitoring model performance to streamline and secure AI operations at Uber.

// Bio
At the moment Demetrios is immersing himself in Machine Learning by interviewing experts from around the world in the weekly MLOps.community meetups. Demetrios constantly learns and engages in new activities to get uncomfortable and learn from his mistakes. He tries to bring creativity into every aspect of his life, whether analyzing the best paths forward, overcoming obstacles, or building Lego houses with his daughter.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Join us at our first in-person conference on June 25 all about AI Quality: <a href="https://www.aiqualityconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.aiqualityconference.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomassmoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Tom Smoker</em></a> is the cofounder of an early stage tech company empowering developers to create knowledge graphs within their RAG pipelines. Tom is a technical founder, and owns the research and development of knowledge graphs tooling for the company.

Managing Small Knowledge Graphs for Multi-agent Systems // MLOps podcast #236 with Tom Smoker, Technical Founder of whyhow.ai.

A big thank you to <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC-zzsm0NuvDx0EH3VtOTOeQ"> @latticeflow </a> for sponsoring this episode! LatticeFlow - https://latticeflow.ai/

// Abstract
RAG is one of the more popular use cases for generative models, but there can be issues with repeatability and accuracy. This is especially applicable when it comes to using many agents within a pipeline, as the uncertainty propagates. For some multi-agent use cases, knowledge graphs can be used to structurally ground the agents and selectively improve the system to make it reliable end to end. 

// Bio
Technical Founder of WhyHow.ai. Did Masters and PhD in CS, specializing in knowledge graphs, embeddings, and NLP. Worked as a data scientist to senior machine learning engineer at large resource companies and startups.

			<title><![CDATA[Just when we Started to Solve Software Docs, AI Blew Everything Up // Dave Nunez // #235]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Join us at our first in-person conference on June 25 all about AI Quality: <a href="https://www.aiqualityconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.aiqualityconference.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/djnunez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>David Nunez</em></a>, based in Santa Barbara, CA, US, is currently a Co-Founder and Partner at <a href="http://www.abstract-group.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Abstract Group</em></a>, bringing experience from previous roles at First Round Capital, Stripe, and Slab.

Just when we Started to Solve Software Docs, AI Blew Everything Up // MLOps Podcast #235 with Dave Nunez, Partner of Abstract Group co-hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-czakon/?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Jakub Czakon</em></a>.

Huge thank you to Zilliz for sponsoring this episode. Zilliz - <a href="https://zilliz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://zilliz.com/</a>.

// Abstract
Over the previous decade, the recipe for making excellent software docs mostly converged on a set of core goals:

 Create high-quality, consistent content
     Use different content types depending on the task
     Make the docs easy to find

For AI-focused software and products, the entire developer education playbook needs to be rewritten.

// Bio
Dave lives in Santa Barbara, CA with his wife and four kids.

He started his tech career at various startups in Santa Barbara before moving to San Francisco to work at Salesforce. After Salesforce, he spent 2+ years at Uber and 5+ years at Stripe leading internal and external developer documentation efforts.

In 2021, he co-authored Docs for Developers to help engineers become better writers. He&#39;s now a consultant, advisor, and angel investor for fast-growing startups. He typically invests in early-stage startups focusing on developer tools, productivity, and AI.

He&#39;s a reading nerd, Lakers fan, and golf masochist.

<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/codydkdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Cody Peterson</em></a> has a diverse work experience in the field of product management and engineering. Cody is currently working as a Technical Product Manager at <a href="https://voltrondata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"><em>Voltron Data</em></a>, starting from May 2023. Previously, they worked as a Product Manager at dbt Labs from July 2022 to March 2023.

MLOps podcast #234 with Cody Peterson, Senior Technical Product Manager at Voltron Data | Ibis project // Open Standards Make MLOps Easier and Silos Harder.

// Abstract
MLOps is fundamentally a discipline of people working together on a system with data and machine learning models. These systems are already built on open standards we may not notice -- Linux, git, scikit-learn, etc. -- but are increasingly hitting walls with respect to the size and velocity of data.

Pandas, for instance, is the tool of choice for many Python data scientists -- but its scalability is a known issue. Many tools make the assumption of data that fits in memory, but most organizations have data that will never fit in a laptop. What approaches can we take?

One emerging approach with the Ibis project (created by the creator of pandas, Wes McKinney) is to leverage existing &quot;big&quot; data systems to do the heavy lifting on a lightweight Python data frame interface. Alongside other open source standards like Apache Arrow, this can allow data systems to communicate with each other and users of these systems to learn a single data frame API that works across any of them.

Open standards like Apache Arrow, Ibis, and more in the MLOps tech stack enable freedom for composable data systems, where components can be swapped out allowing engineers to use the right tool for the job to be done. It also helps avoid vendor lock-in and keep costs low. 

// Bio
Cody is a Senior Technical Product Manager at Voltron Data, a next-generation
data systems builder that recently launched an accelerator-native GPU query
engine for petabyte-scale ETL called Theseus. While Theseus is proprietary,
Voltron Data takes an open periphery approach -- it is built on and interfaces
through open standards like Apache Arrow, Substrait, and Ibis. Cody focuses on the Ibis project, a portable Python dataframe library that aims to be the
standard Python interface for any data system, including Theseus and over 20
other backends.

Prior to Voltron Data, Cody was a product manager at dbt Labs focusing on the open source dbt Core and launching Python models (note: models is a confusing term here). Later, he led the Cloud Runtime team and drastically improved the efficiency of engineering execution and product outcomes.

Cody started his carrer as a Product Manager at Microsoft working on Azure ML. He spent about 2 years on the dedicated MLOps product team, and 2 more years on various teams across the ML lifecycel including data, training, and inferencing.

He is now passionate about using open source standards to break down the silos and challenges facing real world engineering teams, where engineering
increasingly involves data and machine learning.

<p><em>Sanket</em> works as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Spotify</a> working on building end-to-end audio recommender systems. Models built by his team are used across Spotify in many different products including Discover Weekly and Autoplay.

MLOps podcast #232 with Sanket Gupta, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Spotify // 
RecSys at Spotify.

A big thank you to LatticeFlow for sponsoring this episode! LatticeFlow - https://latticeflow.ai/

// Abstract
LLMs with foundational embeddings have changed the way we approach AI today. Instead of re-training models from scratch end-to-end, we instead rely on fine-tuning existing foundation models to perform transfer learning. 
Is there a similar approach we can take with recommender systems? 
In this episode, we can talk about: 
a) how Spotify builds and maintains large-scale recommender systems, 
b) how foundational user and item embeddings can enable transfer learning across multiple products, 
c) how we evaluate this system 
d) MLOps challenges with these systems

// Bio
Sanket works as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer on a team at Spotify building production-grade recommender systems. Models built by my team are being used in Autoplay, Daily Mix, Discover Weekly, etc.
Currently, my passion is how to build systems to understand user taste - how do we balance long-term and short-term understanding of users to enable a great personalized experience.

Ryan has been a founder, entrepreneur, and CEO for 20 years, successfully building, scaling, and selling three companies. He&#39;s passionate about empowering people to become developers and then connecting them together in a global community.

After earning a degree in Computer Science in Colorado, Ryan moved to the UK and worked as a web developer. He then organized global tech conferences, hosting thousands of attendees and influential speakers such as Mark Zuckerberg, the founders of Android, Instagram, and Twitter, among others. His company also produced Twitter’s and Stack Overflow’s developer conferences.

Following that, Ryan started an online Computer Science school. Under his leadership, the team grew to over 100 employees, educating more than 1,000,000 students. During this period, he secured $23 million in venture capital and earned recognition as Entrepreneur of the Year.

Over the last two years Ryan dove deep into AI and LLMs. He built an educational proof-of-concept called maple.coach, which focuses on teaching Sales. The platform is built using technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, gpt-4, and Vercel.

Outside of work, Ryan shares his life with his wife of 20 years and their two teenagers in Connecticut. They enjoy spending their free time sailing and taking walks with their Sheltie, Brinkley.

MLOps podcast #228 with Mohamed Elgendy, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Kolena Inc., What is AI Quality?

// Abstract
Delve into the multifaceted concept of AI Quality. Demetrios and Mo explore the idea that AI quality is dependent on the specific domain, equitable to the difference in desired qualities between a $1 pen and a $100 pen. Mo underscores the performance of a product being in sync with its intended functionality and the absence of unknown risks as the pillars of AI Quality. They emphasize the need for comprehensive quality checks and adaptability of standards to differing product traits. Issues affecting edge deployments like latency are also highlighted. A deep dive into the formation of gold standards for AI, the nuanced necessities for various use cases, and the paramount need for collaboration among AI builders, regulators, and infrastructure firms form the core of the discussion. Elgendy brings to light their ambitious AI Quality Conference, aiming to set tangible, effective, but innovation-friendly Quality standards for AI. The dialogue also accentuates the urgent need for diversification and representation in the tech industry, the variability of standards and regulations, and the pivotal role of testing in AI and machine learning. The episode concludes with an articulate portrayal of how enhanced testing can streamline the entire process of machine learning.

MLOps podcast #225 with Patrick Beukema, Head / Technical Lead of the Environmental AI, Applied Science Organization at AI2, Beyond AGI, Can AI Help Save the Planet?

// Abstract
AI will play a central role in solving some of our greatest environmental challenges. The technology that we need to solve these problems is in a nascent stage -- we are just getting started. For example, the combination of remote sensing (satellites) and high-performance AI operating at a global scale in real-time unlocks unprecedented avenues to new intelligence. 

MLOPs is often overlooked on AI teams, and typically there is a lot of friction in integrating software engineering best practices into the ML/AI workflow. However, performance ML/AI depends on extremely tight feedback loops from the user back to the model that enables high iteration velocity and ultimately continual improvement. 

We are making progress but environmental causes need your help. Join us fight for sustainability and conservation. 

// Bio
Patrick is a machine learning engineer and scientist with a deep passion for leveraging artificial intelligence for social good. He currently leads the environmental AI team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). His professional interests extend to enhancing scientific rigor in academia, where he is a strong advocate for the integration of professional software engineering practices to ensure reliability and reproducibility in academic research. Patrick holds a Ph.D. from the Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon University, where his research focused on neural plasticity and accelerated learning. He applied this expertise to develop state-of-the-art deep learning models for brain decoding of patient populations at a startup, later acquired by BlackRock. His earlier academic work spanned research on recurrent neural networks, causal inference, and ecology and biodiversity.

When not doing computer stuff, you&amp;#39;ll find Phillip in the mountains riding a snowboard or backpacking in the Cascades.

// Abstract
Generative AI is poised to bring impact across all industries and business functions across industries

While many companies pilot GenAI, only a few have deployed GenAI use cases, e.g., retailers are producing videos to answer common customer questions using ChatGPT. A majority of organizations are facing challenges to industrialize and scale, with data being one of the biggest inhibitors.

Organizations need to strengthen their data foundations given that among leading organizations, 72% noted managing data among the top challenges preventing them from scaling impact. Furthermore, leaders noticed that +31% of their staff&#39;s time is spent on non-value-added tasks due to poor data quality and availability issues.

</p>
<p>MLOps podcast #207 with Jake Watson, Principal Data Engineer at The Oakland Group, How Data Platforms Affect ML &amp; AI.

// Abstract
I’ve always told my clients and colleagues that traditional rule-based software is difficult, but software containing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Learning (ML)* is even more difficult, sometimes impossible.

Why is this the case? Well, software is difficult because it’s like flying a plane while building it at the same time, but because AI and ML make rules on the fly based on various factors like training data, it’s like trying to build a plane in flight, but some parts of the plane will be designed by a machine, and you have little idea what that is going to look like till the machine finishes.

This double goes for more cutting-edge AI models like GPT, where only the creators of the software have a vague idea of what it will output.

This makes software with AI / ML more of a scientific experiment than engineering, which is going to make your project manager lose their mind when you have little idea how long a task is going to take.

But what will make everyone’s lives easier is having solid data foundations to work from. Learn to walk before running.

// Bio
Jake has been working in data as an Analyst, Engineer, and/or Architect for over 10 years.
Started as an analyst in the UK National Health Service converting spreadsheets to databases tracking surgical instruments. 
Then continued as an analyst at a consultancy (Capita) reporting on employee engagement in the NHS and dozens of UK Universities. There Jake moved reporting from Excel and Access to SQL Server, Python with frontend websites in d3.js. 
At Oakland Group, a data consultancy, Jake worked as a Cloud Engineer, Data Engineer, Tech Lead, and Architect depending on the project for dozens of clients both big and small (mostly big). Jake has also developed and productionised ML solutions as well in the NLP and classification space.
Jake has experience in building Data Platforms in Azure, AWS, and GCP (though mostly in Azure and AWS) using Infrastructure as Code and DevOps/DataOps/MLOps. 
In the last year, Jake has been writing articles and newsletters for my blog, including a guide on how to build a data platform: https://thedataplatform.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-data-platform

			<title><![CDATA[The Myth of AI Breakthroughs // Jonathan Frankle // #205]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.jfrankle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Jonathan Frankle</a> works as Chief Scientist (Neural Networks) at <a href="https://www.mosaicml.com/">MosaicML</a> (recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-strikes-1-3-billion-deal-for-generative-ai-startup-mosaicml-fdcefc06">acquired</a> by <a href="https://www.databricks.com/">Databricks</a>), a startup dedicated to making it easy and cost-effective for anyone to train large-scale, state-of-the-art neural networks. He leads the research team.

MLOps podcast #205 with Jonathan Frankle, Chief Scientist (Neural Networks) at Databricks, The Myth of AI Breakthroughs, co-hosted by Denny Lee, brought to us by our Premium Brand Partner, Databricks.



// Abstract
Jonathan takes us behind the scenes of the rigorous work they undertake to test new knowledge in AI and to create effective and efficient model training tools. With a knack for cutting through the hype, Jonathan focuses on the realities and usefulness of AI and its application. We delve into issues such as face recognition systems, the &#39;lottery ticket hypothesis,&#39; and robust decision-making protocols for training models. Our discussion extends into Jonathan&#39;s interesting move into the world of law as an adjunct professor, the need for healthy scientific discourse, his experience with GPUs, and the amusing claim of a revolutionary algorithm called Qstar.

// Bio
Jonathan Frankle is Chief Scientist (Neural Networks) at Databricks, where he leads the research team toward the goal of developing more efficient algorithms for training neural networks. He arrived via Databricks’ $1.3B acquisition of MosaicML as part of the founding team. He recently completed his PhD at MIT, where he empirically studied deep learning with Prof. Michael Carbin, specifically the properties of sparse networks that allow them to train effectively (his &quot;Lottery Ticket Hypothesis&quot; - ICLR 2019 Best Paper). In addition to his technical work, he is actively involved in policymaking around challenges related to machine learning. He earned his BSE and MSE in computer science at Princeton and has previously spent time at Google Brain and Facebook AI Research as an intern and Georgetown Law as an Adjunct Professor of Law.

MLOps podcast #205 with Jonathan Frankle, Chief Scientist (Neural Networks) at Databricks, The Myth of AI Breakthroughs, co-hosted by Denny Lee, brought to us by our Premium Brand Partner, Databricks.



// Abstract
Jonathan takes us behind the scenes of the rigorous work they undertake to test new knowledge in AI and to create effective and efficient model training tools. With a knack for cutting through the hype, Jonathan focuses on the realities and usefulness of AI and its application. We delve into issues such as face recognition systems, the &amp;#39;lottery ticket hypothesis,&amp;#39; and robust decision-making protocols for training models. Our discussion extends into Jonathan&amp;#39;s interesting move into the world of law as an adjunct professor, the need for healthy scientific discourse, his experience with GPUs, and the amusing claim of a revolutionary algorithm called Qstar.

// Bio
Jonathan Frankle is Chief Scientist (Neural Networks) at Databricks, where he leads the research team toward the goal of developing more efficient algorithms for training neural networks. He arrived via Databricks’ $1.3B acquisition of MosaicML as part of the founding team. He recently completed his PhD at MIT, where he empirically studied deep learning with Prof. Michael Carbin, specifically the properties of sparse networks that allow them to train effectively (his &amp;quot;Lottery Ticket Hypothesis&amp;quot; - ICLR 2019 Best Paper). In addition to his technical work, he is actively involved in policymaking around challenges related to machine learning. He earned his BSE and MSE in computer science at Princeton and has previously spent time at Google Brain and Facebook AI Research as an intern and Georgetown Law as an Adjunct Professor of Law.

MLOps podcast #204 with Patrick Barker, CTO of Kentauros AI and Farhood Etaati, MLOps/Platform Team Lead at AIMedic, MLOps at the Crossroads.

// Abstract
MLOps is at a crossroads. The ever-increasing excitement for LLMs&#39; ability to solve some interesting real-world problems has made many people interested in applying these models in new applications which comes with its own challenges, that have upstarted the term &quot;LLMLOps&quot;. But how much of those challenges are not a newer representation of what older-gen ML models had to deal with in the production, and the question arises whether developing &quot;new&quot; specialized tools to address these applications actually provides any substantial value for the sustainability of the field in general. Tools are coming and going at a rate that makes many technical people skeptical of adopting newer tools. What can we do as a community to alleviate these issues? Why OSS MLOps is lacking behind and how VC money is contributing to that? 

// Bio
Farhood Etaati
MLOps engineer at AIMedic. Studied EE at Uni of Tehran, started out as a data scientist, and pivoted to software engineering. Currently working on on-premise MLOps platform development suitable for Iran&#39;s infrastructure.

Patrick Barker
When Patrick is not occupied with building his AI company, he enjoys spending time with his wonderful kids or exploring the hills of Boulder.

MLOps podcast #201 with Paco Nathan, Managing Partner at Derwen, Inc., Language, Graphs, and AI in Industry.

// Abstract
Let&#39;s talk about key findings from these conferences, specifically summarizing teams that have ROI on machine learning in production: what are the things in common they&#39;re doing, and what are the most important caveats they urge other teams to consider when getting started? Because these key takeaways aren&#39;t found in the current AI news cycle.

MLOps podcast #199 with Nathan Ryan Frank, Director, Machine Learning Platform &amp; Operations at WW Grainger, Challenges Operationalizing Machine Learning (And Some Solutions).

// Abstract
This talk details some common challenges and pitfalls when attempting to operationalize machine learning systems and discusses some simple solutions. We dive into the machine learning development workflow and cover topics such as team dynamics, communication issues between roles that don&#39;t share a common language, and approaching MLOps from an SRE/DevOps perspective. Similarly, the talk highlights some challenges unique to operationalizing machine learning, drawing distinctions where necessary to highlight a large amount of similarity. Finally, the talk offers some simple and practical guidance for those new to MLOps who want to understand where to start and how to adopt best practices in an evolving field.

// Bio
Nathan Frank is currently the Director of Machine Learning Platform and Operations at Grainger where he is building a team to support the Technology Group&#39;s expanding machine learning efforts. Prior to joining Grainger, Nathan led machine learning engineering efforts at Strong Analytics, a boutique data science and machine learning consulting firm, as well as machine learning platform and development teams at Stats Perform, a leader in sports data and technology. Nathan holds bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees in Astrophysics from UC - Santa Cruz and UNC-Chapel Hill, respectively. When not building machine learning systems, Nathan spends as much time as possible with his favorite person in the world, his wife, as well as their four kids and two dogs, and enjoys getting outside to hike or garden and baking bread.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-hasty">Nick Hasty</a> is the Director of Product, Discovery &amp; Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/giphy">Giphy</a>, an animated-gif search engine that allows users to search, share, and discover GIFs.</p>

MLOps podcast #198, Inferring Creativity.

// Abstract
Generative AI models have captured our imaginations with their ability to produce new &quot;creative&quot; works such as visually striking images, poems, stories, etc, and their outputs often rival or excel what most humans can do. I believe that these developments should make us re-think the nature of creativity itself, and through identifying parallels and differences between generative models and the human brain we can establish a framework to talk about creativity, and its relationship to intelligence, that should hold up against future revelations in ML and neuroscience. 

// Bio
Nick Hasty is a technologist &amp; entrepreneur with a background in the creative arts. He was the founding engineer for GIPHY, where 
he’s worked for the last 10 years and now leads ML/AI product initiatives. He also servers as a consultant helping early-stage startups scale their product and engineering teams. Before GIPHY, he worked with arts+cultural organizations such as Rhizome.org and the Alan Lomax archives. He got his graduate degree from NYU’s ITP program.

			<title><![CDATA[The Role of Infrastructure in ML // Niels Bantilan // #197]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps podcast #197 with Niels Bantilan, Chief Machine Learning Engineer at Union, The Role of Infrastructure in ML Leveraging Open Source brought to us by Union.

// Abstract
When we start out building and deploying models in a new organization, life is simple: all I need to do is grab some data, iterate on a model that fits the data well and performs reasonably well on some held-out test set. Then, if you’re fortunate enough to get to the point where you want to deploy it, it’s fairly straightforward to wrap it in an app framework and host it on a cloud server. However, once you get past this stage, you’re likely to find yourself needing:

More scalable data processing framework
Experiment tracking for models
Heavier duty CPU/GPU hardware
Versioning tools to link models, data, code, and resource requirements
Monitoring tools for tracking data and model quality

There’s a rich ecosystem of open-source tools that solves each of these problems and more: but how do you unify all of them together into a single view? This is where orchestration tools like Flyte can help. Flyte not only allows you to compose data and ML pipelines, but it also serves as “infrastructure as code” so that you can leverage the open-source ecosystem and unify purpose-built tools for different parts of the ML lifecycle on a single platform. ML systems are not just models: they are the models, data, and infrastructure combined.

// Bio
Niels is the Chief Machine Learning Engineer at Union.ai, and core maintainer of Flyte, an open-source workflow orchestration tool, author of UnionML, an MLOps framework for machine learning microservices, and creator of Pandera, a statistical typing and data testing tool for scientific data containers. His mission is to help data science and machine learning practitioners be more productive.

He has a Masters in Public Health with a specialization in sociomedical science and public health informatics, and prior to that a background in developmental biology and immunology. His research interests include reinforcement learning, AutoML, creative machine learning, and fairness, accountability, and transparency in automated systems.

There’s a rich ecosystem of open-source tools that solves each of these problems and more: but how do you unify all of them together into a single view? This is where orchestration tools like Flyte can help. Flyte not only allows you to compose data and ML pipelines, but it also serves as “infrastructure as code” so that you can leverage the open-source ecosystem and unify purpose-built tools for different parts of the ML lifecycle on a single platform. ML systems are not just models: they are the models, data, and infrastructure combined.

</p>
<p>MLOps podcast #196 with Numbers Station&#39;s Venky Ganti SVP, Product &amp; Engineering and Principal Engineer, Laurel Orr, LLMs in Focus: From One-Size Fits All to Verticalized Solutions.

// Abstract
Dive into the realm of large language models (LLMs) as we explore the merits and limitations of &#39;one-size fits all&#39; LLMs, and their role in data analytics. Through customer stories, we showcase real-world applications and contrast general LLMs with verticalized, enterprise-centric models. We address the significance of ownership structures, with a focus on open-source vs proprietary impacts on transparency and trustworthiness. Delving into the NSQL foundation models, we emphasize the importance of diverse, quality training data, especially with enterprise challenges. Lastly, we speculate on the future of LLMs, highlighting hosting solutions and the evolution towards specialized challenges.

			<title><![CDATA[DSPy: Transforming Language Model Calls into Smart Pipelines // Omar Khattab // #194]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps podcast #194 with Omar Khattab, PhD Candidate at Stanford, DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into Self-Improving Pipelines.

// Abstract
The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks. Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded &quot;prompt templates&quot;, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting and pipelines with expert-created demonstrations. On top of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5. DSPy is available as open source at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy

			<title><![CDATA[Guarding LLM and NLP APIs: A Trailblazing Odyssey for Enhanced Security // Ads Dawson // #190]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps podcast #190 with Ads Dawson, Senior Security Engineer at Cohere, Guarding LLM and NLP APIs: A Trailblazing Odyssey for Enhanced Security.

// Abstract
Ads Dawson, a seasoned security engineer at Cohere, explores the challenges and solutions in securing large language models (LLMs) and natural language programming APIs. Drawing on his extensive experience, Ads discusses approaches to threat modeling LLM applications, preventing data breaches, defending against attacks, and bolstering the security of these critical technologies. The presentation also delves into the success of the &quot;OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications&quot; project, co-founded by Ads, which identifies key vulnerabilities in the industry. Notably, Ads owns three of the top 10 vulnerabilities, including Training Data Poisoning, Sensitive Information Disclosure, and Model Theft. 

This OWASP Top 10 serves as a foundational resource for stakeholders in AI, offering guidance on using, developing, and securing LLM applications. Additionally, the session covers insider news from the AI Village&#39;s &#39;Hack the Future&#39; | LLM Red Teaming event at Defcon31, providing insights into the inaugural Generative AI Red Teaming showdown and its significance in addressing security and privacy concerns amid the widespread adoption of AI.

// Bio
A mainly self-taught, driven, and motivated proficient application, network infrastructure &amp; cyber security professional holding over eleven years experience from start-up to large-size enterprises leading the incident response process and specializing in extensive LLM/AI Security, Web Application Security and DevSecOps protecting REST API endpoints, large-scale microservice architectures in hybrid cloud environments, application source code as well as EDR, threat hunting, reverse engineering, and forensics.

Ads have a passion for all things blue and red teams, be that offensive &amp; API security, automation of detection &amp; remediation (SOAR), or deep packet inspection for example.

Ads is also a networking veteran and love a good PCAP to delve into. One of my favorite things at Defcon is hunting for PWNs at the &quot;Wall of Sheep&quot; village and inspecting malicious payloads and binaries.

			<title><![CDATA[Designing for Forward Compatibility in Gen AI // Rohit Agarwal // #189]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps podcast #189 with Rohit Agarwal, CEO of Portkey.ai, Designing for Forward Compatibility in Gen AI.

// Abstract
For two whole years of working with a large LLM deployment, I always felt uncomfortable. How is my system performing? Are my users liking the outputs? Who needs help? Probabilistic systems can make this really hard to understand. In this talk, we&#39;ll discuss practical &amp; implementable items to secure your LLM system and gain confidence while deploying to production.

// Bio
Rohit is the Co-founder and CEO of portkey.ai which is an FMOps stack for monitoring, model management, compliance, and more. Previously, he headed Product &amp; AI at Pepper Content which has served ~900M generations on LLMs in production.

Having seen large LLM deployments in production, he&#39;s always happy to help companies build their infra stacks on FM APIs or Open-source models.

			<title><![CDATA[LLM on K8s Panel // LLMs in Conference in Production Conference Part II]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #178 with LLMs in Production Conference part 2 LLM on K8s Panel, Manjot Pahwa, Rahul Parundekar, and 
Patrick Barker hosted by Outerbounds, Inc.&#39;s Shrinand Javadekar.

// Abstract
Large Language Models require a new set of tools... or do they? K8s is a beast and we like it that way. How can we best leverage all the battle-hardened tech that K8s has to offer to make sure that our LLMs go brrrrrrr. Let&#39;s talk about it in this chat.

// Bio
Shrinand Javadekar
Shri Javadekar is currently an engineer at Outerbounds, focussed on building a fully managed, large-scale platform for running data-intensive ML/AI workloads. Earlier, he spent time trying to start an MLOps company for which he was a co-founder and head of engineering. He led the design, development, and operations of Kubernetes-based infrastructure at Intuit, running thousands of applications, built by hundreds of teams and transacting billions of $$. He has been a founding engineer of the Argo open-source project and also spent precious time at multiple startups that were acquired by large organizations like EMC/Dell and VMWare.

Manjot Pahwa
Manjot is an investor at Lightspeed India and focuses on SaaS and enterprise tech. She has had an operating career of over a decade within the space of fintech, SaaS, and developer tools spanning various geos such as the US, Singapore, and India. 

Before joining Lightspeed, Manjot headed Stripe in India, successfully obtaining the payment aggregator license, growing the team from ~10 to 100+, and driving acquisitions in the region during that time. 

Rahul Parundekar
Rahul has 13+ years of experience building AI solutions and leading teams. He is passionate about building Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) solutions for improving the Human Experience. He is currently the founder of A.I. Hero - a platform to help you fix and enrich your data with ML. At AI Hero, he has also been a big proponent of declarative MLOps - using Kubernetes to operationalize the training and serving lifecycle of ML models and has published several tutorials on his Medium blog.

Before AI Hero, he was the Director of Data Science (ML Engineering) at Figure-Eight (acquired by Appen), a data annotation company, where he built out a data pipeline and ML model serving architecture serving 36 models (NLP, Computer Vision, Audio, etc.) and traffic of up to 1M predictions per day.

Patrick Barker
Patrick started his career in Big Data back when that was cool, then moved into Kubernetes near its inception. He has put major features into the Kubernetes API and built several platforms on top of it.

In recent years he has moved into AI, with a focus on distributed machine learning. He is now working with a startup to reshape the world of AI agents.

			<title><![CDATA[Evaluation Panel // Large Language Models in Production Conference Part II]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #174 with Evaluation Panel, Amrutha Gujjar, Josh Tobin, and Sohini Roy hosted by Abi Aryan.

We are now accepting talk proposals for our next LLM in Production virtual conference on October 3rd. Apply to speak here: https://go.mlops.community/NSAX1O

// Abstract
Language models are very complex thus introducing several challenges in interpretability. The large amounts of data required to train these black-box language models make it even harder to understand why a language model generates a particular output. In the past, transformer models were typically evaluated using perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation. However, LLMs amplify the problem even further due to their generative nature thus making them further susceptible to hallucinations and factual inaccuracies. Thus, evaluation becomes an important concern.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #172 with Lingjiao Chen, FrugalGPT: Better Quality and Lower Cost for LLM Applications. </p>
<p>This episode is sponsored by QuantumBlack.

We are now accepting talk proposals for our next LLM in Production virtual conference on October 3rd. Apply to speak here: https://go.mlops.community/NSAX1O

// Abstract
There is a rapidly growing number of large language models (LLMs) that users can query for a fee. We review the cost associated with querying popular LLM APIs, e.g. GPT-4, ChatGPT, J1-Jumbo, and find that these models have heterogeneous pricing structures, with fees that can differ by two orders of magnitude. In particular, using LLMs on large collections of queries and text can be expensive. Motivated by this, we outline and discuss three types of strategies that users can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated with using LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation, 2) LLM approximation, and 3) LLM cascade. As an example, we propose FrugalGPT, a simple yet flexible instantiation of LLM cascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries in order to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can match the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to 98% cost reduction or improve the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost. The ideas and findings presented here lay a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and efficiently.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps Coffee Sessions #172 with Lingjiao Chen, FrugalGPT: Better Quality and Lower Cost for LLM Applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode is sponsored by QuantumBlack.

We are now accepting talk proposals for our next LLM in Production virtual conference on October 3rd. Apply to speak here: https://go.mlops.community/NSAX1O

// Abstract
There is a rapidly growing number of large language models (LLMs) that users can query for a fee. We review the cost associated with querying popular LLM APIs, e.g. GPT-4, ChatGPT, J1-Jumbo, and find that these models have heterogeneous pricing structures, with fees that can differ by two orders of magnitude. In particular, using LLMs on large collections of queries and text can be expensive. Motivated by this, we outline and discuss three types of strategies that users can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated with using LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation, 2) LLM approximation, and 3) LLM cascade. As an example, we propose FrugalGPT, a simple yet flexible instantiation of LLM cascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries in order to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can match the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to 98% cost reduction or improve the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost. The ideas and findings presented here lay a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and efficiently.

<p>We are now accepting talk proposals for our next LLM in Production virtual conference on October 3rd. Apply to speak here: https://go.mlops.community/NSAX1O

// Abstract</p>
<p>Delve into challenges in implementing LLMs, such as security concerns and collaborative measures against attacks. Emphasize the role of ML engineers and product managers in successful implementation. Explore identifying leading indicators and measuring ROI for impactful AI initiatives.

// Bio
Phillip is on the product team at Honeycomb where he works on a bunch of different developer tooling things. He&#39;s an OpenTelemetry maintainer -- chances are if you&#39;ve read the docs to learn how to use OTel, you&#39;ve read his words. He&#39;s also Honeycomb&#39;s (accidental) prompt engineering expert by virtue of building and shipping products that use LLMs. In a past life, he worked on developer tools at Microsoft, helping bring the first cross-platform version of .NET into the world and grow to 5 million active developers. When not doing computer stuff, you&#39;ll find Phillip in the mountains riding a snowboard or backpacking in the Cascades.

			<title><![CDATA[Experiment Tracking in the Age of LLMs // Piotr Niedźwiedź // MLOps Podcast #168]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #168 with Piotr Niedźwiedź, Experiment Tracking in the Age of LLMs, co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.

// Abstract
Piotr shares his journey as an entrepreneur and the importance of focusing on core values to achieve success. He highlights the mission of Neptune to support ML teams by providing them with control and confidence in their models. The conversation delves into the role of experiment tracking in understanding and debugging models, comparing experiments, and versioning models. Piotr introduces the concept of prompt engineering as a different approach to building models, emphasizing the need for prompt validation and testing methods.

// Bio
Piotr is the CEO of neptune.ai. Day to day, apart from running the company, he focuses on the product side of things. Strategy, planning, ideation, getting deep into user needs and use cases. He really likes it. <br>Piotr&#39;s path to ML started with software engineering. Always liked math and started programming when he was 7. In high school, Piotr got into algorithmics and programming competitions and loved competing with the best. That got him into the best CS and Maths program in Poland which funny enough today specializes in machine learning. <br>Piotr did his internships at Facebook and Google and was offered to stay in the Valley. But something about being a FAANG engineer didn’t feel right. He had this spark to do more, build something himself. So with a few of his friends from the algo days, they started Codilime, a software consultancy, and later a sister company Deepsense.ai machine learning consultancy, where he was a CTO. <br>When he came to the ML space from software engineering, he was surprised by the messy experimentation practices, lack of control over model building, and a missing ecosystem of tools to help people deliver models confidently. <br>It was a stark contrast to the software development ecosystem, where you have mature tools for DevOps, observability, or orchestration to execute efficiently in production. And then, one day, some ML engineers from Deepsense.ai came to him and showed him this tool for tracking experiments they built during a Kaggle competition (which they won btw), and he knew this could be big. <br>He asked around, and everyone was struggling with managing experiments. He decided to spin it off as a VC-funded product company, and the rest is history.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #166 with Roy Hasson &amp; Santona Tuli, Eliminating Garbage In/Garbage Out for Analytics and ML.

// Abstract
Shift left data quality ownership and observability that makes it easy for users to catch bad data at the source and stop it from entering your analytics/ML stack.

// Bio
Santona Tuli
Santona Tuli, Ph.D. began her data journey through fundamental physics—searching through massive event data from particle collisions at CERN to detect rare particles. She’s since extended her machine learning engineering to natural language processing, before switching focus to product and data engineering for data workflow authoring frameworks. As a Python engineer, she started with the programmatic data orchestration tool, Airflow, helping improve its developer experience for data science and machine learning pipelines. Currently, at Upsolver, she leads data engineering and science, driving developer research and engagement for the declarative workflow authoring framework in SQL. Dr. Tuli is passionate about building, as well as empowering others to build, end-to-end data and ML pipelines, scalably. 

Roy Hasson
Roy is the head of product at Upsolver helping companies deliver high-quality data to their analytics and ML tools. Previously, Roy led product management for AWS Glue and AWS Lake Formation.

// Abstract
Rob Hirschfeld, the CEO and co-founder of Rack N, discusses his extensive experience in the DevOps movement. He shares his notable achievement of coining the term &quot;the cloud&quot; and obtaining patents for infrastructure management and API provision. Rob highlights the stagnant progress in operations and the persistent challenges in security and access controls within the industry. The absence of standardization in areas such as Kubernetes and single sign-on complicates the development of robust solutions. To address these issues, Rob underscores the significance of open-source practices, automation, and version control in achieving operational independence and resilience in infrastructure management.

// Bio
Rob is the CEO and Co-founder of RackN, an Austin-based start-up that develops software to help automate data centers, which they call Digital Rebar. 

This platform helps connect all the different pieces and tools that people use to manage infrastructure into workflow pipelines through seamless multi-component automation across the different pieces and parts needed to bring up IT systems, platforms, and applications.
Rob has a background in Scale Computing, Mechanical and Systems Engineering, and specializes in large-scale complex systems that are integrated with the physical environment. 

He has founded companies and been in the cloud and infrastructure space for nearly 25 years and has done everything from building the first Clouds using ESXi betas to serving four terms on the OpenStack Foundation Board.
Rob was trained as an Industrial Engineer and holds degrees from Duke University and Louisiana State University.

// Abstract
The popularity of ChatGPT has brought large language model (LLM) apps and their supporting technologies to the forefront. One of the supporting technologies is vector databases. Yujian shares how vector databases like Milvus are used in production and how they solve one of the biggest problems in LLM app building - data issues. They also discuss how Zilliz is democratizing vector databases through education, expanding access to technologies, and technical evangelism. 

// Bio
Yujian Tang is a Developer Advocate at Zilliz. He has a background as a software engineer working on AutoML at Amazon. Yujian studied Computer Science, Statistics, and Neuroscience with research papers published to conferences including IEEE Big Data. He enjoys drinking bubble tea, spending time with family, and being near water.

			<title><![CDATA[Why is MLOps Hard in an Enterprise? // Maria Vechtomova & Basak Eskili // MLOps Podcast #159]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
MLOps Coffee Sessions #159 with Maria Vechtomova, Lead ML engineer, and Basak Eskili Machine Learning Engineer, at Ahold Delhaize, Why is MLOps Hard in an Enterprise? co-hosted by Abi Aryan.

// Abstract
MLOps is particularly challenging to implement in enterprise organizations due to the complexity of the data ecosystem, the need for collaboration across multiple teams, and the lack of standardization in ML tooling and infrastructure. In addition to these challenges, at Ahold Delhaize, there is a requirement for the reusability of models as our brands seek to have similar data science products, such as personalized offers, demand forecasts, and cross-sell.

// Bio
Maria Vechtomova
Maria is a Machine Learning Engineer at Ahold Delhaize. Maria is bridging the gap between data scientists infra and IT teams at different brands and focuses on standardization of machine learning operations across all the brands within Ahold Delhaize.

During nine years in Data&amp;Analytics, Maria tried herself in different roles, from data scientist to machine learning engineer, was part of teams in various domains, and has built broad knowledge. Maria believes that a model only starts living when it is in production. For this reason, last six years, her focus was on the automation and standardization of processes related to machine learning.

Basak Eskili
Basak Eskili is a Machine Learning Engineer at Ahold Delhaize. She is working on creating new tools and infrastructure that enable data scientists to quickly operationalise algorithms. She is bridging the space between data scientists and platform engineers while improving the way of working in accordance with MLOps principles.

In her previous role, she was responsible for bringing models to production. She focused on NLP projects and building data processing pipelines. Basak also implemented new solutions by using cloud services for existing applications and databases to improve time and efficiency.

			<title><![CDATA[Large Language Models at Cohere // Nils Reimers // MLOps Podcast #158]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #158 with Nils Reimer, MLOps Build or Buy, Large Language Model at Scale co-hosted by Abi Aryan.

// Abstract
Large Language Models with billions of parameters have the possibility to change how we work with textual data. However, running them on scale at potentially hundred millions of texts a day is a massive challenge. 

Nils talks about finding the right model size for respective tasks, model distillation, and promising new ways on transferring knowledge from large to smaller models.

// Bio
Nils Reimers is highly recognized throughout the AI community for creating and maintaining the now-famous Sentence Transformers library (www.SBERT.net) used to develop, train, and use state-of-the-art LLMs. The project has 900+ stars on GitHub and 30M+ installations. 

Nils is currently the Director of Machine Learning at Cohere where he leads the team that develops and trains Large Language Models (LLM) with billions of parameters. Prior to Cohere, Nils created and led the science team for Neural Search at HuggingFace. Nils holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UKP in Darmstadt.

While at Microsoft he got his MS in Computational Linguistics from the University of Washington with a focus on Curriculum Learning for Language Models. Most recently, he has been pursuing his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign focusing on efficient inference for LLMs and robust dense retrieval. During his Ph.D., he worked for companies like Neural Magic, Walmart, Qualtrics, and Mendel.AI and now works on bringing LLMs to search at Neeva. 

Mario Kostelac
Currently building AI-powered products in Intercom in a small, highly effective team. I roam between practical research and engineering but lean more towards engineering and challenges around running reliable, safe, and predictable ML systems. You can imagine how fun it is in LLM era :).

Generally interested in the intersection of product and tech, and building a differentiation by solving hard challenges (technical or non-technical).

Software engineer turned into Machine Learning engineer 5 years ago.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Birth and Growth of Spark: An Open Source Success Story // Matei Zaharia // MLOps Podcast #155]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
MLOps Coffee Sessions #155 with Matei Zaharia, The Birth and Growth of Spark: An Open Source Success Story, co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.

// Abstract
We dive deep into the creation of Spark, with the creator himself - Matei Zaharia Chief technologist at Databricks. This episode also explores the development of Databricks&#39; other open source home run ML Flow and the concept of &quot;lake house ML&quot;. As a special treat Matei talked to us about the details of the &quot;DSP&quot; (Demonstrate Search Predict) project, which aims to enable building applications by combining LLMs and other text-returning systems.

// About the guest:
Matei has the unique advantage of being able to see different perspectives, having worked in both academia and the industry. He listens carefully to people&#39;s challenges and excitement about ML and uses this to come up with new ideas. As a member of Databricks, Matei also has the advantage of applying ML to Databricks&#39; own internal practices. He is constantly asking the question &quot;What&#39;s a better way to do this?&quot;

// Bio
Matei Zaharia is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford and Chief Technologist at Databricks. He started the Apache Spark project during his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, and co-developed other widely used open-source projects, including MLflow and Delta Lake, at Databricks. At Stanford, he works on distributed systems, NLP, and information retrieval, building programming models that can combine language models and external services to perform complex tasks. Matei’s research work was recognized through the 2014 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award for the best Ph.D. dissertation in computer science, an NSF CAREER Award, and the US Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).

			<description><![CDATA[<p>
MLOps Coffee Sessions #153 with Rodolfo Núñez, Multilingual Programming and a Project Structure to Enable It, co-hosted by Abi Aryan.

// Abstract
It&#39;s really easy to mix different programming languages inside the same project and use a project template that enables easy collaboration. It&#39;s not about what language is better, but rather what language solves the given section of your problem better for you. 

// Bio
Rodo has been working in the &quot;Data Space&quot; for almost 7 years. He was a Senior Data Scientist at Entel (a Chilean telecommunications company) and is now a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at the same company, where I also lead three mini teams dedicated to internal cybersecurity; design/promote continuous training for the entire Analytics team and also the whole company; and ensure the improvement of programming practices and code cleanliness standards.

Rodo is currently in charge of helping the team put models into production and define the tools that we will use for it. He specializes in R, but he&#39;s language/tool agnostic: you should use the tool that best solves your current problem.

Rodo studied Mathematical Engineering and MSc in Applied Mathematics at the University of Chile in addition to General Engineering at the École Centrale Marseille.

Rodo really likes to share knowledge (bi-directionally) in whatever he thinks he can contribute. Some things that Rodo like teaching are Data Science, Math, Latin Dances, and whatever he thinks he can give to people.

Rodo&#39;s other interests are computer games (especially Vermintide and Darktide), board games, and dancing to Latin rhythms. Also, he streams some games and Data Science related topics on Twitch.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #152 with Keith Trnka, How A Manager Became a Believer in DevOps for Machine Learning.

// Abstract
Keith Trnka, a seasoned leader in the technology industry, set foot on the MLOps Podcast in a special episode where he shared insights into his experience leading data teams and machine learning teams, becoming a better software engineer, and overseeing a successful migration from a monolith to microservices in the healthcare sector without any downtime. 

Keith&#39;s background includes directing data science at 98.6, improving language models at swipe and nuance, and completing a Ph.D. thesis in language modeling for assistive technology. His work in these areas has contributed to the development of technology applications for healthcare, including telemedicine visits using natural language processing and machine learning.

// Bio
Keith has been in the industry for about 11 years. Most recently he was the Director of Data Science at 98point6 where we made telemedicine visits easier for doctors using natural language processing, machine learning, backend engineering, AWS, and frontend engineering. Prior to that, Keith improved the language models used in mobile phone keyboards at Swype and Nuance. And before that, He did his Ph.D. thesis in language modeling for assistive technology.

Currently, Keith is traveling, mentoring, and doing a side project on machine translation.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>LLM in Production Round Table with Demetrios Brinkmann, Diego Oppenheimer, David Hershey, Hannes Hapke, James Richards, and Rebecca Qian.

// Abstract
Using LLM in production. That&#39;s right. Hype or here to stay? The conversation answers some of the questions that have been asked by our community members like; performance &amp; cost of production, the difference in architectures, Reliability issues, and a bunch of random tangents. We have some heavy hitters for this event!

			<title><![CDATA[The Future of Search in the Era of Large Language Models // Saahil Jain // MLOps Podcast #150]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #150 with Saahil Jain, The Future of Search in the Era of Large Language Models, co-hosted by David Aponte.</p>
<p>
// Abstract
Saahil shares insights into the You.com search engine approach, which includes a focus on a user-friendly interface, third-party apps, and the combination of natural language processing and traditional information retrieval techniques. Saahil highlights the importance of product thinking and the trade-offs between relevance, throughput, and latency when working with large language models. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Saahil also discusses the intersection of traditional information retrieval and generative models and the trade-offs in the type of outputs they produce. He suggests occupying users&#39; attention during long wait times and the importance of considering how users engage with websites beyond just performance.</p>
<p>
// Bio
Saahil Jain is an engineer at You.com. At You.com, Saahil builds searching and ranking systems.

			<title><![CDATA[The Challenges of Deploying (many!) ML Models // Jason McCampbell // MLOps Podcast #149]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #149 with Jason McCampbell, The Challenges of Deploying (many!) ML Models, co-hosted by Abi Aryan and sponsored by Wallaroo.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
In order to scale the number of models a team can manage, we need to automate the most common 90% of deployments to allow ops folks to focus on the challenging 10% and automate the monitoring of running models to reduce the per-model effort for data scientists. The challenging 10% of deployments will often be "edge" cases, whether CDN-style cloud-edge, local servers, or running on connected devices.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Jason McCampbell is the Director of Architecture at Wallaroo.ai and has over 20 years of experience designing and building high-performance and distributed systems. From semiconductor design to simulation, a common thread is that the tools have to be fast, use resources efficiently, and "just work" as critical business applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At Wallaroo, Jason is focused on solving the challenges of deploying AI models at scale, both in the data center and at "the edge". He has a degree in computer engineering as well as an MBA and is an alum of multiple early-stage ventures. Living in Austin, Jason enjoys spending time with his wife and two kids and cycling through the Hill Country.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Intelligence & MLOps // Karl Fezer // MLOps Podcast # 148]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #148 with Karl Fezer, Intelligence &amp; MLOps co-hosted by Abi Aryan.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
This conversation explores various topics including biases, defining intelligence, and the future of large language models and MLOps. Karl discusses his paper on defining intelligence and how it relates to the increasing interest in Artificial Intelligence. Karl shares his thoughts on the overlap between foundational models and MLOps, emphasizing the importance of making high-impact tasks more efficient and easier. The conversation touched on philosophical tangents but ultimately circled back to practical applications of these concepts.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Karl graduated in 2014 from the University of Georgia with a Masters in Science in Artificial Intelligence. Since then, he has continued to stay on top of the latest iterations of Machine Learning and loves trying new open-source frameworks. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For the last 6 years, he has been purely focused on AI Developer Relations. First at Mycroft, the voice assistant startup, then Intel, Arm, briefly at Wallaroo.ai, and now at Lockheed Martin. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
He currently lives in Seattle and spends his free time writing, reading, sailing, and camping.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[The Rise of Serverless Databases // Alex DeBrie // MLOps Podcast #147]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #147 with Alex DeBrie, Something About Databases co-hosted by Abi Aryan.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
For databases, it feels like we're in the middle of a big shift. The first 10-15 years of the cloud were mostly about using the same core infrastructure patterns but in the cloud (SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In the last few years, we're finally seeing data infrastructure that is truly built for the cloud. Elastic, scalable, resilient, managed, etc. Early examples were Snowflake + DynamoDB. The most recent ones are all the 'NewSQL' contenders (Cockroach, Yugabyte, Spanner) or the 'serverless' ones (Neon, Planetscale). Also seeing improvements in caching, search, etc. Exciting times!<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Alex is an AWS Data Hero and self-employed AWS consultant and trainer. He is the author of The DynamoDB Book, a comprehensive guide to data modeling with DynamoDB. Previously, he worked for Stedi and for Serverless, Inc., creators of the Serverless Framework. He loves being involved in the AWS &amp; serverless community, and he lives in Omaha, NE with his family.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #143 with Jill Chase &amp; Manmeet Gujral, Investing in the Next Generation of AI &amp; ML.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Investors are currently focusing on developer tooling and the foundational AI model movement, as they have seen explosive growth in this area. This podcast explores the impact of foundational models on investment thesis and the future of machine learning operations.<br>
<br>
The discussion also touches on the idea of generative AI and large language models, and their potential impact on MLOps in the next 10 years. Jill and Manmeet from Capital G share their insights on this topic.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Jill Chase<br>
Jill is an investor at CapitalG where she focuses on enterprise software, with an emphasis on data infrastructure and AI/ML.<br>
<br>
Prior to joining CapitalG, Jill worked in senior startup operating roles, both as the CEO of a private equity-backed business and as the founder of a Y Combinator-backed startup.<br>
<br>
Jill graduated magna cum laude from Williams College with a dual degree in Economics and Psychology and was captain of the women’s basketball team. She came out to the West Coast to earn an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, but she was born and raised in Boston where she had the opportunity to cheer on the most impressive era of professional sports a city has ever experienced (Go Patriots).<br>
<br>
She lives in the Bay Area with her husband where they spend weekends doing as many outside activities as possible, such as pickleball, tennis, hiking, and running.<br>
<br>
Manmeet Gujral<br>
Manmeet is a member of the CapitalG investment team where he focuses on enterprise software, AI &amp; ML, open source, and product-led-growth companies. Prior to joining CapitalG in 2021, Manmeet worked in product marketing and operations at Tecton. Before that, he worked as a consultant at Bain &amp; Company in San Francisco where he specialized in the go-to-market strategy for technology companies and private equity investment diligence. Manmeet is originally from Albany, New York, and graduated from Dartmouth College with a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics. Manmeet is highly opinionated about pizza, an avid New York sports fan, and always willing to share his latest house or hip-hop playlists.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Approaches to Fairness and XAI // Murtuza Shergadwala // MLOps Podcast #142]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #142 with Murtuza Shergadwala, Approaches to Fairness and XAI co-hosted by Abi Aryan. This episode is sponsored by Fiddler AI.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is continuously evolving, with an increasing focus on providing model-centric explanations in a human-centric manner. However, better frameworks and training for users are needed to fully utilize the potential of XAI tools. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the approach to fairness in XAI, with the industry approaching it from a regulatory standpoint, while academia is engaging in more discussion and research on the topic.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Dr. Murtuza Shergadwala is a data scientist at Fiddler AI. His background is in human-machine interaction and design decision-making. He received his Ph.D. from Purdue University in Mechanical Engineering. Prior to Fiddler, he was a postdoc at the Games User Interaction and Intelligence Lab at UC Santa Cruz where he focused on using Bayesian approaches for modeling cognition and investigating the theory of mind. He’s super passionate about fairness in AI for underrepresented communities.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Airflow Sucks for MLOps // Stephen Bailey // MLOps Podcast #141]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #141 with Stephen Bailey, Airflow Sucks for MLOps co-hosted by Joe Reis.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Stephen discusses his experience working with data platforms, particularly the challenges of training and sharing knowledge among different stakeholders. This talk highlights the importance of having clear priorities and a sense of practicality and mentions the use of modular job design and data classification to make it easier for end users to understand which data to use. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Stephen also mentions the importance of being able to move quickly and not getting bogged down in the quest for perfection. We recommend Stephen's blog post "Airflow's Problem" for further reading.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Stephen has worked as a data scientist, analyst, manager, and engineer, and loves all the domains equally. He currently works at Whatnot, a collectibles marketplace that focuses on live shopping, and has previously worked in privacy tech at Immuta. He has his Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University in educational cognitive neuroscience, but it has yet to help him understand why his three children are so crazy.<br>

&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract &lt;br&gt;
The toolkit and infrastructure empowering machine learning practitioners are advancing as ML adoption accelerates. We&apos;ll go through the current landscape of ML tooling, startups, and new projects from an investor&apos;s perspective.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio &lt;br&gt;
Sakib is a vice president in the San Francisco office where he primarily focuses on early-stage investments in developer platforms, data infrastructure, and machine learning. He has been involved with Bessemer’s investments in Prefect, Coiled, Arcion, Periscope Data (acquired by Sisense), Okera, npm (acquired by GitHub), and LaunchDarkly. Before joining Bessemer, Sakib worked in product at Viagogo, an international marketplace for buying and selling tickets for live events. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Foundational Models are the Future but... with Alex Ratner CEO of Snorkel AI // MLOps Podcast #139]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #139 with Alex Ratner, Putting Foundation Models to Use for the Enterprise co-hosted by Abi Aryan sponsored by Snorkel AI.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Foundation models are rightfully being compared to other game-changing industrial advances like steam engines or electric motors. They’re core to the transition of AI from a bespoke, less predictable science to an industrialized, democratized practice. Before they can achieve this impact, however, we need to bridge the cost, quality, and control gaps. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Snorkel Flow Foundation Model Suite is the fastest way for AI/ML teams to put foundation models to use. For some projects, this means fine-tuning a foundation model for production dramatically faster by creating programmatically labeling training data. For others, the optimal solution will be using Snorkel Flow’s distill, combine, and correct approach to extract the most relevant knowledge from foundation models and encode that value into the right-sized models for your use case. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
AI/ML teams can determine which Foundation Model Suite capabilities to use (and in what combination) to optimize for cost, quality, and control using Snorkel Flow’s integrated workflow for programmatic labeling, model training, and rapid-guided iteration.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Alex Ratner is the Co-founder and CEO of Snorkel AI and an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Prior to Snorkel AI and UW, he completed his Ph.D. in CS advised by Christopher Ré at Stanford, where he started and led the Snorkel open-source project, and where his research focused on applying data management and statistical learning techniques to emerging machine learning workflows such as creating and managing training data and applying this to real-world problems in medicine, knowledge base construction, and more. Previously, he earned his A.B. in Physics from Harvard University.<br>

<br>
// Abstract<br>
When it comes to Dattaraj's interest, you'll hear about his top 3 areas in Machine Learning. What he sees as up and coming, what he's investing his company's time into and where he invests his own time.<br>
<br>
Learn more about rule-based systems, deploying rule-based systems , and how to incorporate systems into more systems. there is no difference between ML systems and deploying models. It's just that this machine learning model is much smarter than traditional rule based models.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Dattaraj Jagdish Rao is the author of the book “Keras to Kubernetes: The Journey of a Machine Learning Model to Production”. Dattaraj leads the AI Research Lab at Persistent and is responsible for driving thought leadership in AI/ML across the company.

			<title><![CDATA[Machine Learning Operations — What is it and Why Do We Need It? // Niklas Kühl // MLOps Podcast #137]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #137 with Niklas Kühl, Machine Learning Operations — What is it and Why Do We Need It? co-hosted by Abi Aryan.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
The final goal of all industrial machine learning (ML) projects is to develop ML products and rapidly bring them into production. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses this issue.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
NIKLAS KÜHL studied Industrial Engineering &amp; Management at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) (Bachelor and Master). During his studies, he gained practical experience in IT by working at Porsche in both national and international roles. Niklas has been working on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in different domains since 2014. In 2017, he gained his PhD (summa cum laude) in Information Systems with a focus on applied machine learning from KIT. In 2020, he joined IBM.<br>
<br>
As of today, Niklas engages in two complementary roles: He is head of the Applied AI in Services Lab at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and, furthermore, he works as a Managing Consultant for Data Science at IBM. In his academic and practical projects, he is working on conceptualizing, designing, and implementing AI in Systems with a focus on robust and fair AI as well as the effective collaboration between users and intelligent agents. Currently, he and his team are actively working on different ML &amp; AI solutions within industrial services, sales forecasting, production lines or even creativity. Niklas is internationally collaborating with multiple institutions like the University of Texas and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Systems Engineer Navigating the World of ML // Andrew Dye // MLOps Podcast #136]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #136 with Andrew Dye, Systems Engineer Navigating the World of ML co-hosted by David Aponte.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
We don't hear that much about working at a very low level on this podcast but they are still very valid. Andrew is able to give us his take on why and what you need to keep in mind when you are working at these low levels and why it is very important when you are a Machine Learning Engineer and how the two can play together nicely.<br>
<br>
Most MLOps teams are formed using existing people and exitsing engineers. More often than not you have to blend these various disciplines and it works well when there's a common goal.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Andrew is a software engineer at Union and contributor to Flyte, a production grade data and ML orchestration platform. Prior to that he was a tech lead for ML Infrastructure at Meta, where he focused on ML training reliability.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #134 with Jeremy Thomas Jordan, Building Threat Detection Systems: An MLE's Perspective co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
There is a clear pattern that we have been seeing with some of these greats in MLOps. So many use writing as a forcing function to learn about where they have holes in their understanding of something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you are not writing, this episode is important as to why writing is important for your own development. Jeremy goes into writing in depth as to how beneficial it is for him to write and for him to see that he doesn't understand something if he cannot re-articulate it in writing.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Jeremy is a machine learning engineer currently working at Duo Security where he focuses on building ML infrastructure to operate threat detection systems at scale. He previously worked at Proofpoint, where he built models for phishing and malware detection.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Real-time Machine Learning with Chip Huyen // MLOps Coffee Sessions #133]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #133 {Podcast BTS} with Chip Huyen, Real-time Machine Learning with Chip Huyen co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Forcing functions and how you can supercharge your learning by putting yourself into a situation where you know you either have a responsibility to others to learn or accountability on you so you have to learn. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
It's not that hard when you think about streaming machine learning. It's not that big of a mental barrier to cross. It is simple in theory but maybe it's more complicated in practice and that's exactly where Chip's perspective is.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Chip Huyen is a co-founder of Claypot AI, a platform for real-time machine learning. Previously, she was with Snorkel AI and NVIDIA. She teaches CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford. She’s the author of the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, an Amazon bestseller in AI.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[What is Data / ML Like on League? // Ian Schweer // MLOps Coffee Sessions #132]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #132 {Podcast BTS} with Ian Schweer, What is Data / ML Like on League? co-hosted by Skylar Payne. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
If you're not an avid gamer yourself, you have never really seen how ML might be used in the gaming space. It's so interesting to see the things that are different like full stories of players' games from start to finish. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
On the surface, Ian is an excellent developer who gets things done. Underneath, he is much more. Ian is a reliable and trustworthy teammate who demonstrates an exceptional ownership mentality. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here's a fair share of Ian's job history:<br>
2014 - UCI (With Skylar!)<br>
2015 - Adobe Primetime (SWE)<br>
2017 - Adobe Product and Customer Analytics (SWE)<br>
2019 - Doordash Data Infra (SWE) Current - Riot Games on League &nbsp;<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #131 {Podcast BTS} with Ethan Rosenthal, Let's Continue Bundling into the Database co-hosted by Mike Del Balso.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
The relationship between ML Engineers and Product Managers is something that we don't talk about enough. We've got to get this right. If we don't get this right, either you're not focusing on the business problems in the right way or the Product Managers are not going to understand the tech appropriately to help make the right decisions.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Ethan works on the Conversations Team at Square leading a team of Artificial Intelligence Engineers. Ethan's team builds applied AI solutions for Square Messages, a messaging hub for Square merchants to communicate with their customers. Prior to Square, Ethan spent time as a freelance data science consultant building machine learning products for a range of companies, from pre-seed startups to Fortune 100 enterprises. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ethan got his start in data science working at two different e-commerce startups, Birchbox and Dia&amp;Co. Before data science, Ethan was an actual scientist and got his Ph.D. in experimental physics from Columbia University.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #130 {Podcast BTS} with Andrew Yates, Adversarial MLOps on Other People's Money: Lessons Learned from Ad Tech co-hosted by Abi Aryan.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Design ML to be components in a larger system with stable interfaces is not tracible to monitor the entire stack as a black box. You need intermediate ground-truth signals. Ads are designed in this way.<br>
<br>
You can go from profitable to non-profitable real quick with ads. This will determine whether your company is around a year or two. You play with money and sometimes you play a lot of it so make sure that it's correct.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Andrew Yates formerly led ads ranking, auction, and marketplace engineering and research teams at Facebook and Pinterest. He specializes in designing billion-dollar content marketplaces that maximize long-term revenue while protecting both seller and user experiences. Andrew has published over a dozen patents in online advertising optimization.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #129 {Podcast BTS} with Catherin Breslin, Voice and Language Tech co-hosted by Adam Sroka.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Back in the day, Speech Recognition was its own thing. It's a very different flavor of Data Science. You could not use a lot of the tools. It wouldn't cross over to this type of machine learning.<br>
<br>
Now, with the advancements, Speech Recognition and Machine learning are coming in together. It's interesting to hear right from someone with a Ph.D. level working with some of the biggest companies in the world doing it. The fact that something like Alexa is lots of models back to back and just fathom the complexity of that is quite cool!<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Catherine is a machine learning scientist and consultant based in Cambridge UK, and the founder of Kingfisher Labs consulting. Since completing her Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge in 2008, Catherine has commercial and academic experience in automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, and human-computer dialogue systems, having previously worked at Cambridge University, Toshiba Research, Amazon Alexa, and Cobalt Speech. Catherine has been excited by the application of research to real-world problems involving speech and language at scale.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #128 with Simon Thompson, Managing Machine Learning Projects co-hosted by Abi Aryan.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
It's a cliche to say that choosing and running the algorithms is only a small part of a typical ML project but despite that it's true! Setting up and organizing the project, dealing with the data asset, getting to the heart of the business problem, assessing and choosing the models, and integrating them with the business processes in production are all at least as time-consuming and important. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Simon has written a book that talks about how these different activities need to be orchestrated and executed and he hopes that it might be useful for people who are starting out managing ML projects and help them avoid some of the crunches and catches that seem to trip people up.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Simon has been building and running ML projects since 1994 (when he started his Ph.D. in MachineLearning). His first commercial project was for the Royal Navy, and since then he has worked in Telecom, Defense, Consultancy, Manufacturing, and Finance. This means Simon has experienced a wide range of working environments and different types of projects. As well as working in a variety of commercial environments Simon collaborated on EU research projects, UK Government funded research projects and worked as an industrial rep on three MIT consortia (BigData@CSAIL, Systems That Learn, and the CISR Data Research Board).<br>
<br>
Simon was also an industrial fellow at the Alan Turing Institute for a year. This means that he has also seen a lot of the communities' practices and concerns as they developed, and he had the chance to put them into use in a commercial environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Right now, Simon is working for a technology consultancy called GFT, and his job there is primarily to deliver ML projects for companies in the capital markets such as investment banks, although we also do work in retail banking, insurance, and manufacturing.<br>

MLOps Coffee Sessions #127 with Niall Murphy &amp; Todd Underwood, Reliable ML co-hosted by David Aponte. &nbsp;&nbsp;// Abstract By applying an SRE mindset to machine learning, authors and engineering professionals Cathy Chen, Kranti Parisa, Niall Richard Murphy, D.

Whether you want to increase revenue, optimize decision-making, solve problems, or understand and influence customer behavior, you'll learn how to perform day-to-day ML tasks while keeping the bigger picture in mind. (Book description from O'Reilly) &nbsp;It was great that they wrote this book in the first place in a space that's new and lots of people are entering it with a lot of questions and this book clarifies those questions. It was also great to have all of their experiences documented in this one book and there's a lot of value in putting them all in one place so that people can benefit from it.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Niall Murphy<br>
Niall has been interested in Internet infrastructure since the mid-1990s. He has worked with all of the major cloud providers from their Dublin, Ireland offices - most recently at Microsoft, where he was the global head of Azure Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). His books have sold approximately a quarter of a million copies worldwide, most notably the award-winning Site Reliability Engineering, and he is probably one of the few people in the world to hold degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Poetry Studies. He lives in Dublin, Ireland, with his wife and two children.<br>
<br>
Todd Underwood<br>
Todd is a Director at Google and leads Machine Learning for Site Reliability Engineering Director. He is also the Site Lead for Google’s Pittsburgh office. ML SRE teams build and scale internal and external ML services and are critical to almost every Product Area at Google. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Before working at Google, Todd held a variety of roles at Renesys. &nbsp;He was in charge of operations, security, and peering for Renesys’s Internet intelligence services which are now part of Oracle's Cloud service. He also did product work for some early social products that Renesys worked on. Before that Todd was the Chief Technology Officer of Oso Grande, an independent Internet service provider (AS2901) in New Mexico.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Databricks Model Serving V2 // Rafael Pierre // Coffee Sessions #125 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #125 with Rafael Pierre, Deploying Real-time ML Models in Minutes with Databricks Model Serving V2 co-hosted by Ryan Russon.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
From our experience helping customers in the Data and AI field, we learned that the most challenging part of Machine Learning is deploying it. Putting models into production is complex and requires additional pieces of infrastructure as well as specialized people to take care of it - this is especially true if we are talking about real-time REST APIs for serving ML models. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
With Databricks Model Serving V2, we introduce the idea of Serverless REST endpoints to the platform. This allows teams to easily deploy their ML models in a production-grade platform with a few mouse clicks (or lines of code 😀).<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Rafael has worked for 15 years in data-intensive fields within finance in multiple roles: software engineering, product management, data engineering, data science, and machine learning engineering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At Databricks, Rafael has fun bringing all these topics together as a Solutions Architect to help our customers become more and more data-driven.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Monitoring Unstructured Data // Aparna Dhinakaran & Jason Lopatecki // Lightning Sessions #2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Lightning Sessions #2 with Aparna Dhinakaran, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer, and Jason Lopatecki, CEO and Co-Founder of Arize. Lightning Sessions is sponsored by Arize<br>
<br>
// Abstract &nbsp;<br>
Monitoring embeddings on unstructured data is not an easy feat let's be honest. Most of us know what it is but don't understand it one hundred percent. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thanks to Aparna and Jason of Arize for breaking down embedding so clearly. At the end of this Lightning talk, we get to see a demo of how Arize deals with unstructured data and how you can use Arize to combat that.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Aparna Dhinakaran<br>
Aparna is the Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Arize AI, a pioneer, and early leader in machine learning (ML) observability. A frequent speaker at top conferences and thought leader in the space, Dhinakaran was recently named to the Forbes 30 Under 30. Before Arize, Dhinakaran was an ML engineer and leader at Uber, Apple, and TubeMogul (acquired by Adobe). During her time at Uber, she built several core ML Infrastructure platforms, including Michaelangelo.<br>
<br>
Aparna has a BA from Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program, where she published research with Berkeley's AI Research group. She is on a leave of absence from the Computer Vision Ph.D. program at Cornell University.<br>
<br>
Jason Lopatecki<br>
Jason is the Co-founder and CEO of Arize AI, a machine learning observability company. He is a garage-to-IPO executive with an extensive background in building marketing-leading products and businesses that heavily leverage analytics. Prior to Arize, Jason was co-founder and chief innovation officer at TubeMogul where he scaled the business into a public company and eventual acquisition by Adobe. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Jason has hands-on knowledge of big data architectures, programmatic advertising systems, distributed systems, and machine learning and data processing architectures. In his free time, Jason tinkers with personal machine learning projects as a hobby, with a special interest in unsupervised learning and deep neural networks. He holds an electrical engineering and computer science degree from UC Berkeley.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Trustworthy Machine Learning // Kush Varshney // Coffee Sessions #124]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #124 with Kush Varshney, Distinguished Research Staff Member and Manager IBM Research, Trustworthy Machine Learning co-hosted by Krishnaram Kenthapadi.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Trustworthy ML is a way of thinking and something to be worked on and operationalized throughout the entire machine learning development lifecycle, starting from the problem specification phase that should include diverse stakeholders.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Kush R. Varshney was born in Syracuse, New York in 1982. He received a B.S. degree (magna cum laude) in electrical and computer engineering with honors from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, in 2004. He received the S.M. degree in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in 2010, both in electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge. While at MIT, he was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow.<br>
<br>
Dr. Varshney is a distinguished research staff member and manager with IBM Research at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, where he leads the machine learning group in the Foundations of Trustworthy AI department. He was a visiting scientist at IBM Research - Africa, Nairobi, Kenya in 2019. He is the founding co-director of the IBM Science for Social Good initiative. He applies data science and predictive analytics to human capital management, healthcare, olfaction, computational creativity, public affairs, international development, and algorithmic fairness, which has led to recognitions such as the 2013 Gerstner Award for Client Excellence for contributions to the WellPoint team and the Extraordinary IBM Research Technical Accomplishment for contributions to workforce innovation and enterprise transformation. He conducts academic research on the theory and methods of trustworthy machine learning. His work has been recognized through best paper awards at the Fusion 2009, SOLI 2013, KDD 2014, and SDM 2015 conferences and the 2019 Computing Community Consortium / Schmidt Futures Computer Science for Social Good White Paper Competition. He self-published a book entitled 'Trustworthy Machine Learning in 2022, available at http://www.trustworthymachinelearning.com. He is a senior member of the IEEE.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #123 with Gleb Abroskin, Machine Learning Engineer at Funcorp, RECOMMENDER SYSTEM: Why They Update Models 100 Times a Day co-hosted by Jake Noble.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
FunCorp was a top 10 app store. It was a very popular app that has a ton of downloads and just memes. They need a recommendation system on top of that. Memes are super tricky because they're user-generated and they evolve very quickly. They're going to live and die by the Recommender System in that product.<br>
<br>
It's incredible to see FunCorp's maturity. Gleb breaks down the feature store they created and the velocity they have to be able to create a whole new pipeline in a new model and put it into production after only a month!<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Gleb make models go brrrrr. He doesn't know what is expected in this field, to be honest, but Gleb has experience in deploying a lot of different ML models for CV, speech recognition, and RecSys in a variety of languages (C++, Python, Kotlin) serving millions of users worldwide.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #122 with Hannes Hapke, Machine Learning Engineer at Digits Financial, Inc., Scaling Similarity Learning at Digits co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Machine Learning in a product is a double-edged sword. It can make a product more useful but it depends on assumed and strictly defined behavior from users. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hannes walks through the entirety of their machine learning pipeline, how they implemented it, what the elements are, what the learning looks like, and what tooling looks like. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hannes maps out what good data hygiene looks like not only from the machine learning perspective down to the software engineering, design, and backend engineering, all the way to the data engineering perspectives.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Hannes was the first ML engineer at Digits, where he built the MLOPs foundation for their ML team. His interest in production machine learning ranges from building ML pipelines to scaling similarity-based ML to process millions of banking transactions daily. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Prior to Digits, Hannes implemented ML solutions for a number of applications, incl. retail, health care, or ERP companies.<br>
He co-author two machine learning books:<br>
* Building Machine Learning Pipeline (O'Reilly)<br>
* NLP in Action (Manning)<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Bringing DevOps Agility to ML// Luis Ceze // Coffee Sessions #121]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #121 with Luis Ceze, CEO and Co-founder of OctoML, Bringing DevOps Agility to ML co-hosted by Mihail Eric. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
There's something about this idea where people see a future where you don't need to think about infrastructure. You should just be able to do what you do and infrastructure happens. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
People understand that there is a lot of complexity underneath the hood and most data scientists or machine learning engineers start deploying things and shouldn't have to worry about the most efficient way of doing this.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Luis Ceze is Co-Founder and CEO of OctoML, which enables businesses to seamlessly deploy ML models to production making the most out of the hardware. OctoML is backed by Tiger Global, Addition, Amplify Partners, and Madrona Venture Group. Ceze is the Lazowska Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where he has taught for 15 years.<br>
<br>
Luis co-directs the Systems and Architectures for Machine Learning lab (sampl.ai), which co-authored Apache TVM, a leading open-source ML stack for performance and portability that is used in widely deployed AI applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Luis is also co-director of the Molecular Information Systems Lab (misl.bio), which led pioneering research in the intersection of computing and biology for IT applications such as DNA data storage. His research has been featured prominently in the media including New York Times, Popular Science, MIT Technology Review, and the Wall Street Journal. Ceze is a Venture Partner at Madrona Venture Group and leads their technical advisory board.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps Coffee Sessions #121 with Luis Ceze, CEO and Co-founder of OctoML, Bringing DevOps Agility to ML co-hosted by Mihail Eric. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract&lt;br&gt;
There&apos;s something about this idea where people see a future where you don&apos;t need to think about infrastructure. You should just be able to do what you do and infrastructure happens. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
People understand that there is a lot of complexity underneath the hood and most data scientists or machine learning engineers start deploying things and shouldn&apos;t have to worry about the most efficient way of doing this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio&lt;br&gt;
Luis Ceze is Co-Founder and CEO of OctoML, which enables businesses to seamlessly deploy ML models to production making the most out of the hardware. OctoML is backed by Tiger Global, Addition, Amplify Partners, and Madrona Venture Group. Ceze is the Lazowska Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where he has taught for 15 years.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Luis co-directs the Systems and Architectures for Machine Learning lab (sampl.ai), which co-authored Apache TVM, a leading open-source ML stack for performance and portability that is used in widely deployed AI applications. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Luis is also co-director of the Molecular Information Systems Lab (misl.bio), which led pioneering research in the intersection of computing and biology for IT applications such as DNA data storage. His research has been featured prominently in the media including New York Times, Popular Science, MIT Technology Review, and the Wall Street Journal. Ceze is a Venture Partner at Madrona Venture Group and leads their technical advisory board.&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #120 with David Stein, Senior Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn, Feathr: LinkedIn's Enterprise-Grade, High-Performance Feature Store co-hosted by Skylar Payne.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
When David started building Feathr, Feature Stores did not exist. That was not a term floating around at all. This was definitely one of the OG Feature Stores for sure! &nbsp;<br>
<br>
We hear how the LinkedIn team got to this point, having an open source release, and how they used LinkedIn as an incubator to build a great product.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
David Stein is a tech lead at LinkedIn working on machine learning feature infrastructure. He is the original architect of Feathr and continues to contribute to its development as well as to other parts of LinkedIn's machine learning platform.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #117 with Chad Sanderson, Head of Product, Data Platform at Convoy, Data Engineering for ML co-hosted by Josh Wills.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Data modeling is building relationships between core concepts within your data. The physical data model shows how the relationships manifest in your data environment but then there's the semantic data model, the way that entity relationship design is extracted away from any data-centric implementation. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Let's do the good old fun of talking about why data modeling is so important!<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Chad Sanderson is the Product Lead for Convoy's Data Platform team, which includes the data warehouse, streaming, BI &amp; visualization, experimentation, machine learning, and data discovery.<br>
<br>
Chad has built everything from feature stores, experimentation platforms, metrics layers, streaming platforms, analytics tools, data discovery systems, and workflow development platforms. He’s implemented open source, SaaS products (early and late-stage) and has built cutting-edge technology from the ground up. Chad loves the data space, and if you're interested in chatting about it with him, don't hesitate to reach out.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Scaling Machine Learning with Data Mesh // Shawn Kyzer // Coffee Sessions #116]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #116 with Shawn Kyzer, Principal Data Engineer at Thoughtworks (Spain), Scaling Machine Learning with Data Mesh co-hosted by Adam Sroka.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
You can't just get something done by using tools. You need to go much deeper than that and it is very clear that Data Mesh is the same thing. You have to educate the organization about the movement. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In this session, Shawn broke down the cultural piece of data mesh and how many parallels there are with the MLOps Movement when it comes to the cultural side of MLOps.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Shawn is passionate about harnessing the power of data strategy, engineering, and analytics in order to help businesses uncover new opportunities. As an innovative technologist with over 13 years of experience, Shawn removes technology as a barrier and broadens the art of the possible for business and product leaders. His holistic view of technology and emphasis on developing and motivating strong engineering talent, with a focus on delivering outcomes whilst minimising outputs, is one of the characteristics which sets him apart from the crowd.<br>
<br>
Shawn’s deep technical knowledge includes distributed computing, cloud architecture, data science, machine learning, and engineering analytics platforms. He has years of experience working as a consultant practitioner for a variety of prestigious clients ranging from secret clearance level government organizations to Fortune 500 companies.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #115 with Flaviu Vadan, Senior Software Engineer at Dyno Therapeutics, How Hera is an Enabler of MLOps Integrations co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Flaviu talks about the internal ML platform at Dyno Therapeutics called Hera. His team uses Hera as an internal innovation engine to help discover new breakthroughs with machine learning in the biotech healthcare industry.<br>
<br>
/ Bio<br>
Flaviu is a Senior Software Engineer at Dyno Therapeutics, the leading organization in the design of novel gene therapy vectors with transformative delivery properties for a vast landscape of human diseases. Flaviu comes from a background focused on Bioinformatics, which is a field that combines Computer Science, Mathematics, and Biology. He took stints in academia by working as a research assistant in Computer Science and Bioinformatics labs before joining Dyno Therapeutics to work on machine-guided design of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At Dyno, Flaviu works on compute and core infrastructure, DevOps, MLOps, and approaches that combine AI/ML to design AAVs in silico. He is also the author and maintainer of Hera, a Python SDK that facilitates access to Argo Workflows by making workflow construction and submission easy and accessible.<br>

<br>
// Abstract <br>
The difficulties of making multi-modal recommender systems. How it can be easy to know something about a user but very hard to know the same thing about a product and vice versa? For example, you can clearly know that a user wants an intellectual movie, but it is hard to accurately classify a movie as intellectual and fully automated.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Marc Lindner Marc has a background in Knowledge Engineering. He's Always extremely product-focused with anything to do with Machine Learning. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Marc built several products working together with companies such as Lithium Technologies etc. and then co-Founded eezy.<br>
<br>
Amr Mashlah <br>
Amr is the head of data science at eezy, where he leads the development of their recommender engine. Amr has a master's degree in AI and has been working with startups for 6 years now.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Building Better Data Teams // Leanne Fitzpatrick // Coffee Sessions #113]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #113 with Leanne Fitzpatrick, Director of Data Science of Financial Times, Building Better Data Teams co-hosted by Mihail Eric.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
We spent a lot of time talking about data tooling but we maybe spent not as much time talking about data organizations and efficiently running and organizing data teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What about starting with limitations instead of aspirations? Right constraints instead of the north star? In this session, let's learn more about a realistic take on the state of data organizations of today.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Leanne is Director of Data Science at the Financial Times and is a passionate data leader with experience building and developing empowered data science and analytics teams in a variety of businesses. Leanne is in her element when developing and implementing strategic, technical, and cultural solutions to getting machine learning and data science into the operational ecosystem.<br>
<br>
Leanne is an active part of the data and technology community, sharing innovation and insights to encourage best practices, from Manchester, UK to Austin, TX, and is an Advisory Panel Board Member. Outside of all things data you can ask Leanne about her golf swing (it’s not good - yet), her passion for American Football (specifically the Cincinnati Bengals), her latest sewing project, and her love for good music, food, and whisky.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[More than a Cache: Turning Redis into a Composable, ML Data Platform // Samuel Partee // Coffee Sessions #111]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #111 with Samuel Partee, Principal Applied AI Engineer of Redis, More than a Cache: Turning Redis into a Composable, ML Data Platform co-hosted by Mihail Eric. This episode is sponsored by Redis.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Pushing forward the Redis platform to be more than just the web-serving cache that we've known it up to now. It seems like a natural progression for the platform, we see how they're evolving to be this AI-focused, AI native serving platform that does vector similarity, feature stored provides those kinds of functionalities.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
A Principal Applied AI Engineer at Redis, Sam helps guide the development and direction of Redis as an online feature store and vector database. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sam's background is in high-performance computing including ML-related topics such as distributed training, hyperparameter optimization, and scalable inference.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #110 with David Bayliss, Chief Data Scientist of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Just Fetch the Data and then... co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Composing data to extract features can be a significant problem. Key factors are the data size, compliance restrictions, and real-time data. Ethics (and law) can drive extremely complex audit requirements. In the cloud, you can do anything - at a price.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
One of the creators of the world's first big data platform (HPCC); &nbsp;David has been tackling big data problems for two decades. A mathematician, compiler writer, and data sponge with more than five dozen patents spanning platforms linking, and search.<br>
<br>
Most inventors think outside the box; David can't even remember where the box is. He leads the team that creates their core Data Science methods used by hundreds of data scientists.<br>

<br>
// Abstract<br>
Airflow is a beloved tool by data engineers and Machine Learning Engineers alike. But when doing ML what are the shortcomings and why is an orchestration tool like that not always the best developer experience? In this episode, we break down what some key drivers are for using an ML-specific orchestration tool.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Ketan Umare is the CEO and co-founder at Union.ai. Previously he had multiple Senior roles at Lyft, Oracle, and Amazon ranging from Cloud, Distributed storage, Mapping (map-making), and machine-learning systems. He is passionate about building software that makes engineers' lives easier and provides simplified access to large-scale systems. Besides software, he is a proud father, and husband, and enjoys traveling and outdoor activities.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[ML Flow vs Kubeflow 2022 // Byron Allen // Coffee Sessions #108]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #108 with Byron Allen, AI &amp; ML Practice Lead at Contino, ML Flow vs Kubeflow 2022 co-hosted by George Pearse.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
The amazing Byron Allen talks to us about why MLflow and Kubeflow are not playing the same game! &nbsp;<br>
<br>
ML flow vs Kubeflow is more like comparing apples to oranges or as he likes to make the analogy they are both cheese but one is an all-rounder and the other a high-class delicacy. This can be quite deceiving when analyzing the two. We do a deep dive into the functionalities of both and the pros/cons they have to offer.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Byron wears several hats. AI &amp; ML practice lead, solutions architect, ML engineer, data engineer, data scientist, Google Cloud Authorized Trainer, and scrum master. He has a track record of successfully advising on and delivering data science platforms and projects. Byron has a mix of technical capability, business acumen, and communication skills that make me an effective leader, team player, and technology advocate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #106 with Curtis Northcutt, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Cleanlab, Cleanlab: Labeled Datasets that Correct Themselves Automatically co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Pioneered at MIT by 3 Ph.D. Co-Founders, Cleanlab is an open-source/SaaS company building the premier data-centric AI tools workflows for (1) automatically correcting messy data and labels, (2) auto-tracking of dataset quality over time, (3) automatically finding classes to merge and delete, (4) auto ml for data tasks, (5) obtaining and ranking high-quality annotations, and (6) training ML models with messy data.<br>
<br>
Most of the prescriptive tasks (finding issues) can be done in one line of code with their open-source product: <a href="">https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab</a>.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Curtis Northcutt is the CEO and Co-Founder of Cleanlab focused on making AI work reliably for people and their messy, real-world data by automatically fixing issues in any ML dataset. Curtis completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT, receiving the MIT Thesis Award, NSF Fellowship, and the Goldwater Scholarship. Prior to Cleanlab, Curtis worked at AI research groups including Google, Oculus, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and NASA.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Making MLFlow // Lead MLFlow Maintainer Corey Zumar // MLOps Coffee Sessions #103]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #103 with Corey Zumar, MLOps Podcast on Making MLflow co-hosted by Mihail Eric.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Because MLOps is a broad ecosystem of rapidly evolving tools and techniques, it creates several requirements and challenges for platform developers:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
- To serve the needs of many practitioners and organizations, it's important for MLOps platforms to support a variety of tools in the ecosystem. This necessitates extra scrutiny when designing APIs, as well as rigorous testing strategies to ensure compatibility. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Extensibility to new tools and frameworks is a must, but it's important not to sacrifice maintainability. MLflow Plugins (https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html) is a great example of striking this balance. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Open source is a great space for MLOps platforms to flourish. MLflow's growth has been heavily aided by: 1. meaningful feedback from a community of ML practitioners with a wide range of use cases and workflows &amp; 2. collaboration with industry experts from a variety of organizations to co-develop APIs that are becoming standards in the MLOps space.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Corey Zumar is a software engineer at Databricks, where he’s spent the last four years working on machine learning infrastructure and APIs for the machine learning lifecycle, including model management and production deployment. Corey is an active developer of MLflow. He holds a master’s degree in computer science from UC Berkeley.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Fixing Your ML Data Blind Spots // Yash Sheth // MLOps Coffee Sessions #102]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #102 with Yash Sheth, Fixing Your ML Data Blindspots co-hosted by Adam Sroka. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Improving your dataset quality is absolutely critical for effective ML. Finding errors in your datasets is generally a slow, iterative, and painstaking process. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Data scientists should be proactively fixing their model’s blindspots by improving their training data. In this talk, Yash discusses how Galileo helps data scientists identify, fix, and track data across the entire ML workflow. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Co-founder and VP of Engineering. Prior to starting Galileo, Yash spent the last decade working on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) at Google, leading their core speech recognition platform team, that powers speech-to-text across 20+ products at Google in over 80 languages along with thousands of businesses through their Cloud Speech API. &nbsp;<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #101 with Piero Molino, Declarative Machine Learning Systems: Big Tech Level ML Without a Big Tech Team co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Declarative Machine Learning Systems are the next step in the evolution of Machine Learning infrastructure.</p>
<p>With such systems, organizations can marry the flexibility of low-level APIs with the simplicity of AutoML.<br>
<br>
Companies adopting such systems can increase the speed of machine learning development, reaching the quality and scalability that only big tech companies could achieve until now, without the need for a team of several thousand people.<br>
<br>
Predibase is the turnkey solution for adopting declarative ML systems at an enterprise scale.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Piero Molino is CEO and co-founder of Predibase, a company redefining ML tooling. Most recently, he has been Staff Research Scientist at Stanford University working on Machine Learning systems and algorithms in Prof. Chris Ré's' Hazy group. Piero completed a Ph.D. in Question Answering at the University of Bari, Italy. Founded QuestionCube, a startup that built a framework for semantic search and QA. Worked for Yahoo Labs in Barcelona on learning to rank, IBM Watson in New York on natural language processing with deep learning, and then joined Geometric Intelligence, where he worked on grounded language understanding.<br>
<br>
After Uber acquired Geometric Intelligence, Piero became one of the founding members of Uber AI Labs. At Uber, he worked on research topics including Dialogue Systems, Language Generation, Graph Representation Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Meta-Learning. He also worked on several deployed systems like COTA, an ML and NLP model for Customer Support, Dialogue Systems for driver's hands-free dispatch, the Uber Eats Recommender System with graph learning and collusion detection. He is the author of Ludwig, a Linux-Foundation-backed open source declarative deep learning framework.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #100 with Matthijs Brouns, MLOps Critiques co-hosted by David Aponte.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
MLOps is too tool-driven, don't let FOMO drive you to pick the latest feature/model/evaluation/ store but pay closer attention to what you actually need to release more safely and reliably.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Matthijs is a Machine Learning Engineer, active in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. His current work involves training MLEs at Xccelerated.io. This means Matthijs divides his time between building new training materials and exercises, giving live trainings, and acting as a sparring partner for the Xccelerators at their partner firms, as well as doing some consulting work on the side.<br>
<br>
Matthijs spent a fair amount of time contributing to their open scientific computing ecosystem through various means. He maintains open source packages (scikit-lego, seers) as well as co-chairs the PyData Amsterdam conference and meetup.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #97 with Jacob Tsafatinos, Real-Time Exactly-Once Event Processing with Apache Flink, Kafka, and Pinot co-hosted by Mihail Eric.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
A few years ago Uber set out to create an ads platform for the Uber Eats app that relied heavily on three pillars; Speed, Reliability, and Accuracy. Some of the technical challenges they were faced with included exactly-once semantics in real-time. To accomplish this goal, they created the architecture diagram above with lots of love from Flink, Kafka, Hive, and Pinot. You can dig into the whole paper <a href="">(https://go.mlops.community/k8gzZd)</a> to see all the reasoning for their design decisions.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Jacob Tsafatinos is a Staff Software Engineer at Elemy. He led the efforts of the Ad Events Processing system at Uber and has previously worked on a range of problems including data ingestion for search and machine learning recommendation pipelines. In his spare time, he can be found playing lead guitar in his band Good Kid.</p>

Some of the technical challenges they were faced with included exactly-once semantics in real-time. To accomplish this goal, they created the architecture diagram above with lots of love from Flink, Kafka, Hive, and Pinot. You can dig into the whole paper &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;(https://go.mlops.community/k8gzZd)&lt;/a&gt; to see all the reasoning for their design decisions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio&lt;br&gt;
Jacob Tsafatinos is a Staff Software Engineer at Elemy. He led the efforts of the Ad Events Processing system at Uber and has previously worked on a range of problems including data ingestion for search and machine learning recommendation pipelines. In his spare time, he can be found playing lead guitar in his band Good Kid.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #96 with Sebastián Ramírez, FastAPI for Machine Learning co-hosted by Adam Sroka.<br>
<br>
// Abstract</p>
<p>Fast API almost never happened. Sebastián Ramírez, the creator of FastAPI, tried as hard as possible not to build something new. After many failed attempts at finding what he was looking for he decided to scratch his own itch and build a new product. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The conversation goes over what Fast API is, how Sebastián built it, what the next big problems to tackle in ML are, and how to focus on adding value where you can.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
👋 Sebastián Ramírez is the creator of FastAPI, Typer, and other open-source tools.<br>
<br>
Currently, Sebastián is a Staff Software Engineer at Forethought while also helping other companies as an external consultant.🤓<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #95 with Ciro Greco, MLOps as Tool to Shape Team and Culture.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Good MLOps practices are a way to operationalize a more “vertical” practice and blur the boundaries between different stages of “production-ready”. Sometimes you have this idea that production-ready means global availability but with ML products that need to be constantly tested against real-world data, we believe production-ready should be a continuum and that the key person that drives that needs to be the data scientist or the ML engineer.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Ciro Greco, VP of AI at Coveo. Ph.D. in Linguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience at Milano-Bicocca. Ciro worked as visiting scholar at MIT and as a post-doctoral fellow at Ghent University.<br>
<br>
In 2017, Ciro founded Tooso.ai, a San Francisco-based startup specializing in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Tooso was acquired by Coveo in 2019. Since then Ciro has been helping Coveo with DataOps and MLOps throughout the turbulent road to IPO.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #94 with Mark Freeman, Traversing the Data Maturity Spectrum: A Startup Perspective.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
A lot of companies talk about having ML and being data-driven, but few are there currently and doing it well. If anything, many companies are on the cusp of implementing ML rather than being ML mature. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
As a startup, what decisions are we making today to drive data maturity and set us up for success when we further implement ML in the near future. What business cases are we making for leadership buy-in to invest in data infrastructure as compared to product development while we identify product-market-fit.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Mark is a community health advocate turned data scientist interested in the intersection of social impact, business, and technology. His life’s mission is to improve the well-being of as many people as possible through data—especially among those marginalized.<br>
<br>
Mark received his M.S. from the Stanford School of Medicine where he was trained in clinical research, experimental design, and statistics with an emphasis on observational studies. In addition, Mark is also certified in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.<br>
<br>
He is currently a senior data scientist at Humu where he builds data tools that drive behavior change to make work better. His core responsibilities center around 1) building data products that reach Humu's end users, 2) providing product analytics for the product team, and 3) building data infrastructure and driving data maturity.<br>

&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Haaga and the Interos team walk us through their design decisions in building an internal data platform. Joseph talks about why their use case wasn&apos;t a fit for off the self solutions, what their internal tool snitch does, and how they use git as a model registry. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio &lt;br&gt;
Joseph leads the ML Platform team at Interos, the operational resilience company. He was introduced to ML Ops while working as a Senior Data Engineer and has spent the past year building a platform for experimentation and serving. He lives in Washington, DC, with his dog Cheese.&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Bringing Audio ML Models into Production // Valerio Velardo // MLOps Coffee Sessions #90]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #90 with Valerio Velardo, Bringing Audio ML Models into Production.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
The majority of audio/music tech companies that employ ML still don’t use MLOps regularly. In these companies, you rarely find audio ML pipelines which take care of the whole ML lifecycle in a reliable and scalable manner. Audio ML probably pays the price of being a small sub-discipline of ML. It’s dwarfed by ML applications in image processing and NLP.<br>
<br>
In audio ML, novelties tend to travel slowly. However, things are starting to change. A few audio and music tech companies are investing in MLOps. Building MLOps solutions for music presents unique challenges because audio data is significantly different from all other data types.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Valerio is MLOps Lead at Utopia Music. He’s also an AI audio consultant who helps companies implement their AI music vision by providing technical, strategy, and talent sourcing services.<br>
<br>
Valerio is interested both in the R&amp;D and productization (MLOps) aspects of AI applied to the audio and music domains. He's the host of The Sound of AI, the largest YouTube channel and online community on AI audio with more than 22K subscribers.<br>
<br>
Previously, Valerio founded and led Melodrive, a tech startup that developed an AI-powered music engine capable of generating emotion-driven video game music in real-time. Valerio earned a Ph.D. in music AI from the University of Huddersfield (UK).<br>

			<title><![CDATA[ML Platform Tradeoffs and Wondering Why to Use Them // Javier Mansilla // MLOps Coffee Sessions #88]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #88 with Javier Andres Mansilla, ML Platform Tradeoffs and Wondering Why to Use Them.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Javier runs ML Platform at Mercado Libre. We’re here with Javier because he’s going to tell us about what the ML platform at Mercado Libre looks like granularly, talk about its purpose, lessons, wins, and future improvements, and share with us some of the most challenging use cases they’ve had to engineer around.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
During the last 3 years building the internal ML platform for Mercado Libre (NASDAQ MELI), the biggest company in Latam, and the eCommerce &amp; fintech omnipresent solution for the continent.<br>
<br>
Seasoned entrepreneur and leader, Javier was co-founder and CTO of Machinalis, a hi-end company building Machine Learning since 2010 (yes, before the breakthrough of neuralnets). When Machinalis got acquired by Mercado Libre, that small team evolved to enable Machine Learning as a capability for a tech giant with more 10k devs, impacting the lives of almost 100 million direct users.<br>
<br>
On a daily basis, Javier leads not only the tech and product roadmap of their Machine Learning Platform, but also their users' tracking system, the AB Testing framework, and the open-source office.<br>
<br>
Javier loves hanging out with family and friends, python, biking, &nbsp;football, carpentry, and slow-paced holidays in nature!<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps Coffee Sessions #88 with Javier Andres Mansilla, ML Platform Tradeoffs and Wondering Why to Use Them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract&lt;br&gt;
Javier runs ML Platform at Mercado Libre. We’re here with Javier because he’s going to tell us about what the ML platform at Mercado Libre looks like granularly, talk about its purpose, lessons, wins, and future improvements, and share with us some of the most challenging use cases they’ve had to engineer around.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio&lt;br&gt;
During the last 3 years building the internal ML platform for Mercado Libre (NASDAQ MELI), the biggest company in Latam, and the eCommerce &amp;amp; fintech omnipresent solution for the continent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Seasoned entrepreneur and leader, Javier was co-founder and CTO of Machinalis, a hi-end company building Machine Learning since 2010 (yes, before the breakthrough of neuralnets). When Machinalis got acquired by Mercado Libre, that small team evolved to enable Machine Learning as a capability for a tech giant with more 10k devs, impacting the lives of almost 100 million direct users.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On a daily basis, Javier leads not only the tech and product roadmap of their Machine Learning Platform, but also their users&apos; tracking system, the AB Testing framework, and the open-source office.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Javier loves hanging out with family and friends, python, biking, &amp;nbsp;football, carpentry, and slow-paced holidays in nature!&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #87 with Kyle Morris, Don't Listen Unless You Are Going to Do ML in Production.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Companies wanting to leverage ML specializes in model quality (architecture, training method, dataset), but face the same set of undifferentiated work they need to productionize the model. They must find machines to deploy their model on, set it up behind an API, make the inferences fast, cheap, reliable by optimizing hardware, load-balancing, autoscaling, clustering launches per region, queueing long-running tasks... standardizing docs, billing, logging, CI/CD that integrates testing, and more.<br>
<br>
<a href="">Banana.dev</a>'s aim is to simplify this process for all. This talk outlines our learnings and the trials and tribulations of ML hosting.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Hey all! Kyle did self-driving AI @ Cruise, robotics @ CMU, currently in business @ Harvard. Now he's building banana.dev to accelerate ML! Kyle cares about safely building superhuman AI. Our generation has the chance to build tools that advance society 100x more in our lifetime than in all of history, but it needs to benefit all living things! This requires a lot of technical + social work. Let's go!<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Building ML/Data Platform on Top of Kubernetes // Julien Bisconti // MLOps Coffee Sessions #86]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #86 with Julien Bisconti, Building ML/Data Platform on Top of Kubernetes. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
When building a platform, a good start would be to define the goals and features of that platform, knowing it will evolve. Kubernetes is established as the de facto standard for scalable platforms but it is not a fully-fledged data platform. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Do ML engineers have to learn and use Kubernetes directly? &nbsp;<br>
<br>
They probably shouldn't. So it is up to the data engineering team to provide the tools and abstraction necessary to allow ML engineers to do their work. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The time, effort, and knowledge it takes to build a data platform is already quite an achievement. When it is built, one has to maintain it, monitor it, train people to on-call rotation, implement escalation policies and disaster recovery, optimize for usage and costs, secure it and build a whole ecosystem of tools around it (front-end, CLI, dashboards). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
That cost might be too high and time-consuming for some companies to consider building their own ML platform as opposed to cloud offering alternatives. Note that cloud offerings still require some of those points but most of the work is already done.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Julien is a software engineer turned Site Reliability Engineer. He is a Google developer expert, certified Data Engineer on Google Cloud and Kubernetes Administrator, mentor for Woman Developer Academy and Google For Startups program. He is working on building and maintaining data/ML platform.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #85 with Emmanuel Ameisen, Continuous Deployment of Critical ML Applications.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Finding an ML model that solves a business problem can feel like winning the lottery, but it can also be a curse. Once a model is embedded at the core of an application and used by real users, the real work begins. That's when you need to make sure that it works for everyone, that it keeps working every day, and that it can improve as time goes on. Just like building a model is all about data work, keeping a model alive and healthy is all about developing operational excellence.<br>
<br>
First, you need to monitor your model and its predictions and detect when it is not performing as expected for some types of users. Then, you'll have to devise ways to detect drift, and how quickly your models get stale. Once you know how your model is doing and can detect when it isn't performing, you have to find ways to fix the specific issues you identify.

&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract&lt;br&gt;
Finding an ML model that solves a business problem can feel like winning the lottery, but it can also be a curse. Once a model is embedded at the core of an application and used by real users, the real work begins. That&apos;s when you need to make sure that it works for everyone, that it keeps working every day, and that it can improve as time goes on. Just like building a model is all about data work, keeping a model alive and healthy is all about developing operational excellence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First, you need to monitor your model and its predictions and detect when it is not performing as expected for some types of users. Then, you&apos;ll have to devise ways to detect drift, and how quickly your models get stale. Once you know how your model is doing and can detect when it isn&apos;t performing, you have to find ways to fix the specific issues you identify. Last but definitely not least, you will now be faced with the task of deploying a new model to replace the old one, without disrupting the day of all the users that depend on it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A lot of the topics covered are active areas of work around the industry and haven&apos;t been formalized yet, but they are crucial to making sure your ML work actually delivers value. While there aren&apos;t any textbook answers, there is no shortage of lessons to learn.&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #84 with Ernest Chan, Lessons from Studying FAANG ML Systems.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Large tech companies invest in ML platforms to accelerate their ML efforts. Become better prepared to solve your own MLOps problems by learning from their technology and design decisions.<br>
<br>
Tune in to learn about ML platform components, capabilities, and design considerations.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Ernest is a Data Scientist at Duo Security. As part of the core team that built Duo's first ML-powered product, Duo Trust Monitor, he faced many (frustrating) MLOps problems first-hand. That led him to advocate for an ML infrastructure team to make it easier to deliver ML products at Duo. Prior to Duo, Ernest worked at an EdTech company, building data science products for higher-ed. Ernest is passionate about MLOps and using ML for social good.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #83 with Vincent Warmerdam, Better Use cases for Text Embeddings.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Text embeddings are very popular, but there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about their applications. There's algorithmic fairness, compute requirements as well as issues with datasets that they're typically trained on.<br>
<br>
In this session, Vincent gives an overview of some of these properties while also talking about an underappreciated use-case for the embeddings: labeling!<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Vincent D. Warmerdam is a senior data professional who worked as an engineer, researcher, team lead, and educator in the past. He's especially interested in understanding algorithmic systems so that one may prevent failure. As such, he has a preference for simpler solutions that scale, as opposed to the latest and greatest from the hype cycle. He currently works as a Research Advocate at Rasa where he collaborates with the research team to explain and understand conversational systems better.<br>
<br>
Outside of Rasa, Vincent is also well known for his open-source projects (scikit-lego, human-learn, doubtlab, and more), collaborations with open source projects like spaCy, his blog over at koaning.io, and his calm code educational project.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Practitioners Guide to MLOps // Donna Schut and Christos Aniftos // Coffee Sessions #82]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #82 with Donna Schut and Christos Aniftos, Practitioners Guide to MLOps.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
The "Practitioners Guide to MLOps" introduced excellent frameworks for how to think about the field. Can we talk about how you've seen the advice in that guide applied to real-world systems? Is there additional advice you'd add to that paper based on what you've seen since its publication and with new tools being introduced?<br>
<br>
Your article about selecting the right capabilities has a lot of great advice. It would be fun to walk through a hypothetical company case and talk about how to apply that advice in a real-world setting.<br>
<br>
GCP has had a lot of new offerings lately, including Vertex AI. It would be great to talk through what's new and what's coming down the line. Our audience always loves hearing how tool providers like GCP think about the problems customers face and how tools are correspondingly developed.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Investing in MLOps // Leigh Marie Braswell and Davis Treybig // MLOps Coffee Sessions #81]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #81 with Davis Treybig and Leigh Marie Braswell, Machine Learning from the Viewpoint of Investors.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving space that can be hard to keep track of. Every year, thousands of research papers are published in the space, and hundreds of new companies are built both in applied machine learning as well as in machine learning tooling.<br>
<br>
In this podcast, we interview two investors who focus heavily on machine learning to get their take on the state of the machine learning industry today: Leigh-Marie Braswell at Founders Fund and Davis Treybig at Innovation Endeavors. We discuss their perspectives on opportunities&nbsp;within MLOps and applied machine learning, common pitfalls and challenges seen in machine learning startups, and new projects they find exciting and interesting in the space.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Davis Treybig<br>
Davis (email: <a href="">davis@innovationendeavors.com</a>) is currently a principal on the investment team at Innovation Endeavors, an early-stage venture firm focused on highly technical companies. He primarily focuses on software infrastructure, especially data tooling and security.

Davis studied computer science and electrical engineering in college.<br>
<br>
Leigh Marie Braswell<br>
Leigh Marie (Twitter: <a href="">@LM_Braswell</a>) is an investor at Founders Fund. Before joining Founders Fund, she was an early engineer &amp; the first product manager at Scale AI, where she originally built &amp; later led product development for the LiDAR/3D annotation products, used by many autonomous vehicles, robots, and AR/VR companies as a core step in their machine learning lifecycles. She also has done software development at Blend, machine learning at Google, and quantitative trading at Jane Street.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #80 with Ale Solano, The Journey from Data Scientist to MLOps Engineer.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
After years of failed POCs then all of a sudden one of our models is accepted and will be used in production. The next morning we are part of the main scrum stand-up meeting and a DevOps guy is assisting us. A strange feeling, unknown to us until then, starts growing on the AI team: we are useful!<br>
<br>
Deploying models to production is challenging, but MLOps is more than that. MLOps is about making an AI team useful and iterative from the beginning. And it requires a role that takes care of the technical challenges that this implies, given the experimental nature of the ML field, while also serving the product and business needs. If your AI team does not include this role, maybe it's your time to step up and do it yourself! Today, we will chat with Ale about the transition from being a data scientist to a self-called MLOps engineer. And yes, you'll need to study computer science.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Ale is born and raised in a mid-small town near Malaga in southern Spain. Ale did his bachelor's degree in robotics because it sounded cool and then he got into machine learning because it was even cooler.<br>
<br>
Ale worked in two companies as an ML developer. Now he's on a temporary hiatus to study business and computer science and get a motivation boost.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #79 with Orr Shilon, Platform Thinking: A Lemonade Case Study. &nbsp;</p>
<p>// Abstract <br>
This episode is the epitome of why people listen to our podcast. It’s a complete discussion of the technical, organizational, and cultural challenges of building a high-velocity, machine learning platform that impacts core business outcomes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Orr tells us about the focus on automation and platform thinking that’s uniquely allowed Lemonade’s engineers to make long-term investments that have paid off in terms of efficiency. He tells us the crazy story of how the entire data science team of 20+ people was supported by only 2 ML engineers at one point, demonstrating the leverage their technical strategy has given engineers. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Orr is an ML Engineering Team Lead at Lemonade, currently working an ML Platform, empowering Data Scientists to manage the ML lifecycle from research to development and monitoring. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Previously, Orr worked at Twiggle on semantic search, at Varonis on data governance, and at Intel. He holds a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Psychology from Tel Aviv University. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Orr also enjoys trail running and sometimes races competitively. &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Data Mesh - The Data Quality Control Mechanism for MLOps? // Scott Hirleman // MLOps Coffee Sessions #77]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #77 with Scott Hirleman, Data Mesh - The Data Quality Control Mechanism for MLOps?</p>
<p>// Abstract <br>
Scott covers what is a data mesh at a high level for those not familiar. Data mesh is potentially a great win for ML/MLOps as there is very clear guidance on creating useful, clean, well-documented/described and interoperable data for "unexpected use". So instead of data spelunking being a harrowing task, it can be a very fruitful one. And that one data set that was so awesome?<br>
<br>
Well, it wasn't a one-off, it's managed as a product with regular refreshes! And there is a LOT more ownership/responsibility on data producers to make sure the downstream doesn't break. Might sound like kumbaya for MLOps (or total BS?) re far cleaner data and fewer upstream breaks so let's discuss the realities and limitations!<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
A self-professed "chaotic (mostly) good character", Scott is focused on helping the data mesh community accelerate towards finding solutions for some of data management's hardest challenges. He founded the Data Mesh Learning community specifically to gather enough people to exchange ideas - much of which is patterned off the MLOps community. He hosts the Data Mesh Radio podcast, where he dives deep into topics related to data mesh to provide the data community with useful perspectives and thoughts on data mesh.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Build a Culture of ML Testing and Model Quality // Mohamed Elgendy // MLOps Coffee Sessions #76]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #76 with Mohamed Elgendy, Build a Culture of ML Testing and Model Quality.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Machine learning engineers and data scientists spend most of their time testing and validating their models’ performance. But as machine learning products become more integral to our daily lives, the importance of rigorously testing model behavior will only increase.<br>
<br>
Current ML evaluation techniques are falling short in their attempts to describe the full picture of model performance. Evaluating ML models by only using global metrics (like accuracy or F1 score) produces a low-resolution picture of a model’s performance and fails to describe the model performance across types of cases, attributes, scenarios.<br>
<br>
It is rapidly becoming vital for ML teams to have a full understanding of when and how their models fail and to track these cases across different model versions to be able to identify regression. We’ve seen great results from teams implementing unit and functional testing techniques in their model testing. In this talk, we’ll cover why systematic unit testing is important and how to effectively test ML system behavior.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Mohamed is the Co-founder &amp; CEO of Kolena and the author of the book “Deep Learning for Vision Systems”. Previously, he built and managed AI/ML organizations at Amazon, Twilio, Rakuten, and Synapse. Mohamed regularly speaks at AI conferences like Amazon's DevCon, O'Reilly's AI conference, and Google's I/O.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Towards Observability for ML Pipelines // Shreya Shankar // MLOps Coffee Sessions #75]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #75 with Shreya Shankar, Towards Observability for ML Pipelines.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Achieving observability in ML pipelines is a mess right now. We are tracking thousands of means, percentiles, and KL divergences of features and outputs in a haphazard attempt to figure out when and how to retrain models.<br>
<br>
In this session, we break down current unsuccessful approaches and discuss the path towards effectively maintaining ML models in production. Along the way, we introduce mltrace -- a preliminary open source project striving towards "bolt-on" observability in ML pipelines.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Shreya Shankar is a computer scientist living in the Bay Area. She's interested in building systems to operationalize machine learning workflows. Shreya's research focus is on end-to-end observability for ML systems, particularly in the context of heterogeneous stacks of tools.<br>
<br>
Currently, Shreya is doing her Ph.D. in the RISE lab at UC Berkeley. Previously, she was the first ML engineer at Viaduct, did research at Google Brain, and completed her BS and MS in computer science at Stanford University.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Scaling Biotech // Jesse Johnson // MLOps Coffee Sessions #74]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #74 with Jesse Johnson, Scaling Biotech.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Scaling a biotech research platform requires managing organization complexity - teams, functions, projects - rather than just the traditional volume, velocity, and variety. By examining the processes and experiments that drive the platform, you can focus your work where it matters the most by finding the ideal balance for each type of experiment along with a number of common trade-offs.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Jesse Johnson is head of Data Science and Data Engineering at Dewpoint Therapeutics, an R&amp;D-stage biotech startup. His interest in exploring complex systems, understanding what makes them tick, then using this understanding to improve and scale them led him from academic mathematics, into software engineering (Google, Verily Life Sciences), and then to Biotech (Sanofi, Cellarity, Dewpoint). His goal is to identify ways to scale biotech research through better software and organizational design.<br>

<br>
// Abstract<br>
Breno and Matheus were part of an organizational change at Neoway in recent years. With the creation of cross-functional and platform teams in order to improve the value stream generated by these. They share their experience in creating a machine learning platform team. The challenges they faced along the way, how they approached using product thinking and the results achieved so far.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Matheus Frata Matheus is an Electronics Engineer that got into Data Science by accident!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #72 with Vishnu Rachakonda and Demetrios Brinkmann, 2021 MLOps Year in Review.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Vishnu and Demetrios sit down to reflect on some of the biggest news and learnings from 2021 from the biggest funding rounds to best insights. The two finish out the chat by talking about what to expect in 2022.</p>
<p>// Bio<br>
Demetrios Brinkmann<br>
At the moment Demetrios is immersing himself in Machine Learning by interviewing experts from around the world in the weekly MLOps.community meetups. Demetrios is constantly learning and engaging in new activities to get uncomfortable and learn from his mistakes. He tries to bring creativity into every aspect of his life, whether that be analyzing the best paths forward, overcoming obstacles, or building lego houses with his daughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Rachakonda<br>
Vishnu is the operations lead for the MLOps Community and co-hosts the MLOps Coffee Sessions podcast. He is a machine learning engineer at Tesseract Health, a 4Catalyzer company focused on retinal imaging. In this role, he builds machine learning models for clinical workflow augmentation and diagnostics in on-device and cloud use cases. Since studying bioengineering at Penn, Vishnu has been actively working in the fields of computational biomedicine and MLOps. In his spare time, Vishnu enjoys suspending all logic to watch Indian action movies, playing chess, and writing.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #69 with James Lamb, Building for Small Data Science Teams co-hosted by Adam Sroka.<br>
</p>
<p>// Abstract<br>
In this conversation, James shares some hard-won lessons on how to effectively use technology to create applications powered by machine learning models.</p>
<p>James also talks about how making the "right" architecture decisions is as much about org structure and hiring plans as it is about technological features.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
James Lamb is a machine learning engineer at SpotHero, a Chicago-based parking marketplace company. He is a maintainer of LightGBM, a popular machine learning framework from Microsoft Research, and has made many contributions to other open-source data science projects, including XGBoost and prefect. Prior to joining SpotHero, he worked on a managed Dask + Jupyter + Prefect service at Saturn Cloud and as an Industrial IoT Data Scientist at AWS and Uptake. Outside of work, he enjoys going to hip hop shows, watching the Celtics / Red Sox, and watching reality TV (he wouldn’t object to being called “Bravo Trash”).<br>
<br>
// Relevant Links<br>
James keeps track of conference and meetup talks he has given at <a href="">https://github.com/jameslamb/talks#gallery</a>. The audience for this podcast might be most interested in "Scaling LightGBM with Python and Dask" and "How Distributed LightGBM on Dask Works".<br>

			<title><![CDATA[ML Stepping Stones: Challenges & Opportunities for Companies // John Crousse // Coffee Sessions #67]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #67 with John Crousse, ML Stepping Stones: Challenges &amp; Opportunities for Companies co-hosted by Adam Sroka.</p>
<p>// Abstract<br>
In this coffee session, John shares his observations after working with multiple companies which were in the process of scaling up their ML capabilities.</p>
<p>John's observations are mostly around changes in practices, successes, failures, and bottlenecks identified when building ML products and teams from scratch. John shares a few thoughts on building long-term products vs short-term projects, on the important non-ML components, and the most common missing pieces he sees in today's ecosystem. John also elaborates on how those challenges and solutions can differ for different company sizes.</p>
<p>// Bio<br>
John always liked CS/ML/AI but wasn't such a hot topic back then. He found opportunities to work on models in the Financial industry as a consultant from 2007 to 2017 then he went freelance to move outside of the financial industry, and focus on AI/ML. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
John likes to do things efficiently, and MLOps is the bottleneck, so he ended up spending more time on MLOPs than models lately. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
John finished his CS degree in 2007. &nbsp;<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #66 with Jacopo Tagliabue, Machine Learning at Reasonable Scale.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
We believe that immature data pipelines are preventing a large portion of industry practitioners from leveraging the latest research on ML: truth is, outside of Big Tech and advanced startups, ML systems are still far from producing the promised ROI.<br>
<br>
The good news is that times are changing: thanks to a growing ecosystem of tools and shared best practices, even small teams can be incredibly productive at a “reasonable scale”. Based on our experience as founders and researchers, we present our philosophy for modern, no-nonsense data pipelines, highlighting the advantages of a "PaaS-like" approach.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, SFI, MIT), Jacopo Tagliabue was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, an A.I. company in San Francisco acquired by Coveo in 2019. Jacopo is currently the Director of AI at Coveo, shipping models to hundreds of customers and millions of users. When not busy building products, he is exploring topics at the intersection of language, reasoning, and learning: his research and industry work is often featured in the general press and premier A.I. venues. In previous lives, he managed to get a Ph.D., do sciency things for a pro basketball team, and simulate a pre-Columbian civilization.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #65 with Skylar Payne, The Future of Data Science Platforms is Accessibility.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>// Abstract <br>
The machine learning and data science space is blowing up -- new tools are popping up every day. While we seem to have every type of "Flow" and "Store" you could imagine, few people really understand how to glue this stuff together. Despite all the tools we have available, we still see companies failing to leverage data science effectively to drive business results.<br>
<br>
Instead of spending time driving business results, data scientists spend their time fiddling with Kubernetes, trying to debug that Spark serialization error figuring out how to map their code into the awkward "AI Pipeline" SDK. We have an industry filled with tools built by engineers... for engineers, rather than for data scientists. It's deeply disempowering.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, data is still used effectively to drive decisions in many companies. Analysts have been solving very similar problems on the back of applications like Excel, Tableau, and Mode for literally decades. While there are still challenges in analytics, the MLOps space could learn something from analytics tools. Analytics tools better understand how to make their tools accessible. Analytics tools better understand the value of iterability. Analytics tools better understand that data problems are wicked problems: &nbsp;<br>
- we have to iterate on the formulation and solution simultaneously <br>
- they involve many stakeholders with different opinions <br>
- there's no "right" answer <br>
- the problems are never 100% solved.<br>
<br>
If we're going to really drive the most business value from data science, we need to understand how to design our teams and tools to effectively work against such problems.<br>
<br>
The future of data science platforms is accessibility and iterability.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Data is a superpower, and Skylar has been passionate about applying it to solve important problems across society. For several years, Skylar worked on large-scale, personalized search and recommendation at LinkedIn -- leading teams to make step-function improvements in our machine learning systems to help people find the best-fit role. Since then, he shifted my focus to applying machine learning to mental health care to ensure the best access and quality for all. To decompress from his workaholism, Skylar loves lifting weights, writing music, and hanging out at the beach!<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #64 with Slater Victoroff, The Future of AI and ML in Process Automation.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
The Unstructured Imperative <br>
Recent advances in AI have dramatically advanced the state of the art around unstructured data, especially in the spaces of NLP and computer vision. Despite this, the adoption of unstructured technologies has remained low. Why do you think that is? How have the dynamics changed in the last five years?<br>
<br>
Multimodal AI &nbsp;<br>
Historic AI approaches have generally been constrained to one data modality (i.e. text or image). Recently, a wide range of papers in image captioning and document understanding have emphasized the need for more sophisticated "multimodal" techniques which can fuse information from multiple modalities. What is multimodal learning, and why is it so promising? Why are we seeing such an explosion of activity? What is Indico doing in this space?<br>
<br>
Machine Teaching <br>
As methods of supervision become more complex and multi-faceted, many researchers have begun investigating the inverse problem. That is how do we design supervision systems that more naturally follow human processes? What are some interesting trends in "the space", and where can we expect this field to go in the next few years?<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Slater Victoroff is the Founder and CTO of Indico, an enterprise AI solution for unstructured content that emphasizes document understanding. &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[PyTorch: Bridging AI Research and Production // Dmytro Dzhulgakov // Coffee Sessions #63]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dmytro Dzhulgakov, PyTorch: Bridging AI Research and Production. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Talking PyTorch is always interesting, as the Facebook ML OSS project is one of the most important parts of the machine learning tooling ecosystem. This week, we talked to Dmytro Dzhulgakov, a tech lead for PyTorch.<br>
<br>
We started off talking about Dmytro's journey to being an engineer and tech lead at Facebook, and what his role entails. Dmytro has been at Facebook for 10+ years, so he gave some very interesting advice on how to manage a career in software engineering for the machine learning world. After that, we got deep into the present and future of PyTorch and what improvements the project is making to support MLOps workflows. PyTorch is a large project, and Dmytro shared with us the valuable lessons he learned from confronting multifaceted scaling challenges while working on PyTorch. Finally, we talked about the future of machine learning engineering, especially as relates to how software engineers work by comparison.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Over the past few years, PyTorch became the tool of choice for many AI developers ranging from academia to industry. With the fast evolution of state-of-the-art in many AI domains, the key desired property of the software toolchain is to enable the swift transition of the latest research advances to practical applications.<br>
<br>
In this coffee session, Dmytro discusses some of the design principles that contributed to this popularity, how PyTorch navigates inherent tension between research and production requirements, and how AI developers can leverage PyTorch and PyTorch ecosystem projects for bringing AI models to their domain.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Dmytro Dzhulgakov is a technical lead of PyTorch at Facebook where he focuses on the framework core development and building the toolchain for bringing AI from research to production.<br>
<br>
Previously he was one of the creators of ONNX, a joint initiative aimed at making AI development more interoperable. Before that Dmytro built several generations of large-scale machine learning infrastructure that powered products like Ads or News Feed.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Dmytro Dzhulgakov, PyTorch: Bridging AI Research and Production. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Talking PyTorch is always interesting, as the Facebook ML OSS project is one of the most important parts of the machine learning tooling ecosystem. This week, we talked to Dmytro Dzhulgakov, a tech lead for PyTorch.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We started off talking about Dmytro&apos;s journey to being an engineer and tech lead at Facebook, and what his role entails. Dmytro has been at Facebook for 10+ years, so he gave some very interesting advice on how to manage a career in software engineering for the machine learning world. After that, we got deep into the present and future of PyTorch and what improvements the project is making to support MLOps workflows. PyTorch is a large project, and Dmytro shared with us the valuable lessons he learned from confronting multifaceted scaling challenges while working on PyTorch. Finally, we talked about the future of machine learning engineering, especially as relates to how software engineers work by comparison.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract &lt;br&gt;
Over the past few years, PyTorch became the tool of choice for many AI developers ranging from academia to industry. With the fast evolution of state-of-the-art in many AI domains, the key desired property of the software toolchain is to enable the swift transition of the latest research advances to practical applications.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this coffee session, Dmytro discusses some of the design principles that contributed to this popularity, how PyTorch navigates inherent tension between research and production requirements, and how AI developers can leverage PyTorch and PyTorch ecosystem projects for bringing AI models to their domain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio &lt;br&gt;
Dmytro Dzhulgakov is a technical lead of PyTorch at Facebook where he focuses on the framework core development and building the toolchain for bringing AI from research to production.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Previously he was one of the creators of ONNX, a joint initiative aimed at making AI development more interoperable. Before that Dmytro built several generations of large-scale machine learning infrastructure that powered products like Ads or News Feed.&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Coffee Sessions #60 with Svet Penkov, ML Tests.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
How confident do you feel when you deploy a new model? Does improving an ML model feel like a game of "whack-a-mole"? ML is taking over all sorts of industries and yet ML testing tools are virtually non-existent.<br>
<br>
Drawing parallels from software engineering and electronic circuit board design to the aviation and semiconductor industries, the need for principled quality assurance (QA) step in the MLOps pipeline is long overdue. Let's talk about why ML testing is hard, what can we do about it and what place should ML QA take in the future?<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Svet has been building robots ever since he was a kid. At some point, Svet got interested in not just how to build them, but actually how to make them think, and so he did a Ph.D. in AI &amp; Robotics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. Towards the end of Svet's Ph.D., he joined FiveAI as a Research Scientist and led the motion prediction team for 3 years.<br>
<br>
Throughout his career, Svet spent endless hours fixing model regressions and fighting with edge cases and so at some point he had enough of it and decided it's time to do something about it. That's how Svet started Efemarai where they are building a platform for testing and improving ML continuously.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Linkedin Job Recommendations // Alexandre Patry // Coffee Sessions #60]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #60 with Alexandre Patry, Path to Productivity in Job Search and Job Recommendation AI at LinkedIn.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
A year ago, LinkedIn job search and recommendation AI teams were at the end of a growth cycle. They were fighting many fires at once: a high number of user complaints, engineers spending a significant amount of their time keeping our machine learning pipelines running, online infrastructure that wasn't supporting their growth, and challenges ramping new models to experiment. In this talk, Alex discusses how they all came together to manage these challenges and set themselves for their next phase of growth.</p>
<p><br>
// Bio<br>
Alex has been a machine learning engineer at LinkedIn for almost seven years. He had tour of duties in LinkedIn Groups, content search, and discovery, feed, and has been tech leading in LinkedIn Talent Solutions and Careers for the last two years.<br>
<br>
Prior to working at LinkedIn, Alex lived in Montreal where he completed a Ph.D. in Statistical Machine Translation, then work for five years on information extraction.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Coffee Sessions #60 with Alexandre Patry, Path to Productivity in Job Search and Job Recommendation AI at LinkedIn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract&lt;br&gt;
A year ago, LinkedIn job search and recommendation AI teams were at the end of a growth cycle. They were fighting many fires at once: a high number of user complaints, engineers spending a significant amount of their time keeping our machine learning pipelines running, online infrastructure that wasn&apos;t supporting their growth, and challenges ramping new models to experiment. In this talk, Alex discusses how they all came together to manage these challenges and set themselves for their next phase of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
// Bio&lt;br&gt;
Alex has been a machine learning engineer at LinkedIn for almost seven years. He had tour of duties in LinkedIn Groups, content search, and discovery, feed, and has been tech leading in LinkedIn Talent Solutions and Careers for the last two years.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Prior to working at LinkedIn, Alex lived in Montreal where he completed a Ph.D. in Statistical Machine Translation, then work for five years on information extraction.&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[ Data Selection for Data-Centric AI: Data Quality Over Quantity // Cody Coleman // Coffee Sessions #59]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #59 with Cody Coleman, Data Quality Over Quantity or Data Selection for Data-Centric AI.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
Big data has been critical to many of the successes in&nbsp;ML, but it brings its own problems. Working with massive datasets is cumbersome and expensive, especially with unstructured data like images, videos, and speech. Careful data selection can mitigate the pains of big data by focusing computational and labeling resources on the most valuable examples. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Cody Coleman, a recent Ph.D. from Stanford University and founding member of MLCommons, joins us to describe how a more data-centric approach that focuses on data quality rather than quantity can lower the AI/ML barrier. Instead of managing clusters of machines and setting up cumbersome labeling pipelines, you can spend more time tackling real problems.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Cody Coleman recently finished his Ph.D. in CS at Stanford University, where he was advised by Professors Matei Zaharia and Peter Bailis. His research spans from performance benchmarking of hardware and software systems (i.e., DAWNBench and MLPerf) to computationally efficient methods for active learning and core-set selection. His work has been supported by the NSF GRFP, the Stanford DAWN Project, and the Open Phil AI Fellowship.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #58 with Anne Cocos, 10 Types of Features your Location ML Model is Missing.<br>
<br>
// Abstract <br>
Machine learning on geographic data is relatively under-studied in comparison to ML on other formats like images or graphs. But geographic data is prevalent across a wide variety of domains (although many practitioners may not think of it that way). Clearly, any dataset with `latitude` and `longitude` columns can be viewed as geographic data, but also any dataset with a `zipcode`, `city`, `address`, or `county` can be construed as geographic. Demographics, weather, foot traffic, points of interest, and topographic features can all be used to enrich a dataset with any of these types of keys.<br>
<br>
Incorporating relatively straightforward geographic features into models can yield substantial improvements; adding "distance to the beach" or "square mileage reachable within 10 min drive" to a real estate pricing model, for example, can lead to significant decreases in model error.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, many ML teams find it difficult to incorporate these types of geographic data into their models because the process of ingesting from geographic formats (geojson or shapefiles), projecting, and properly joining with their existing data can be a large infrastructure lift.<br>
<br>
In this coffee session, Anne discusses ways to simplify the process of incorporating geographic or location data into the MLOps workflow, as well as interesting trends in the geographic ML research community that will ultimately make it easier for us to learn from geography just as we do with images or graphs today.<br>
<br>

&lt;p&gt;// Bio&lt;br&gt;
Michael Del Balso&lt;br&gt;
Mike is the co-founder of Tecton, where he is focused on building next-generation data infrastructure for Operational ML. Before Tecton, Mike was the PM lead for the Uber Michelangelo ML platform. He was also a product manager at Google where he managed the core ML systems that power Google’s Search Ads business. Previous to that, he worked on Google Maps. He holds a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering summa cum laude from the University of Toronto.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Erik Bernhardsson&lt;br&gt;
Erik is currently working on some crazy data stuff since early 2021 but previously spent 6 years as the CTO of Better.com, growing the tech team from 1 to 300. Before Better, Erik spent 6 years at Spotify, building the music recommendation system and managing a team focused on machine learning.&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Machine Learning SRE // Niall Murphy // MLOps Coffee Sessions #54]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #54 with Niall Murphy, Machine Learning SRE.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
SRE is making its way into the machine learning world. Software engineering for machine learning requires reliability, performance, and maintainability. Site reliability engineering is the field that deals with reliability and ensuring constant, real-time performance. Niall Murphy, most recently Global Head of SRE at Microsoft Azure, helps us understand what SRE can do for modern ML products and teams.<br>
<br>
Building machine learning teams requires a diverse set of technical experiences, and Niall shares his thoughts on how to do that most effectively. Machine learning organizations need to start to take advantage of SRE best practices like SLOs, which Niall walks through. Production machine learning depends on high-quality software engineering, and we get Niall's take on how to ensure that in a machine learning context.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Niall Murphy has been interested in Internet infrastructure since the mid-1990s. He has worked with all of the major cloud providers from their Dublin, Ireland offices - most recently at Microsoft, where he was global head of Azure Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). His books have sold approximately a quarter of a million copies worldwide, most notably the award-winning Site Reliability Engineering, and he is probably one of the few people in the world to hold degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Poetry Studies. He lives in Dublin, Ireland, with his wife and two children.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #53 with David Aponte, Demetrios Brinkmann, and Vishnu Rachakonda, MLOps Insights.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
MLOps Insights from MLOps community core organizers Demetrios Brinkmann, Vishnu Rachakonda, and David Aponte. In this conversation the guys do a deep dive on testing with respect to MLOps, talk about what they have learned recently around the ML field, and what new things are happening with the MLOps community.</p>
<p>//Bio<br>
David Aponte<br>
David is one of the organizers of the MLOps Community. He is an engineer, teacher, and lifelong student. He loves to build solutions to tough problems and share his learnings with others. He works out of NYC and loves to hike and box for fun. He enjoys meeting new people so feel free to reach out to him!</p>
<p>Demetrios Brinkmann<br>
At the moment Demetrios is immersing himself in Machine Learning by interviewing experts from around the world in the weekly MLOps.community meetups. Demetrios is constantly learning and engaging in new activities to get uncomfortable and learn from his mistakes. He tries to bring creativity into every aspect of his life, whether that be analyzing the best paths forward, overcoming obstacles, or building lego houses with his daughter.</p>
<p>Vishnu Rachakonda<br>
Vishnu is the operations lead for the MLOps Community and co-hosts the MLOps Coffee Sessions podcast. He is a machine learning engineer at Tesseract Health, a 4Catalyzer company focused on retinal imaging. In this role, he builds machine learning models for clinical workflow augmentation and diagnostics in on-device and cloud use cases. Since studying bioengineering at Penn, Vishnu has been actively working in the fields of computational biomedicine and MLOps. In his spare time, Vishnu enjoys suspending all logic to watch Indian action movies, playing chess, and writing.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #52 with Dave Bergstein, Vector Similarity Search at Scale.<br>
<br>
//Abstract <br>
Ever wonder how Facebook and Spotify now seem to know you better than your friends? Or why the search feature in some products really “gets” you while in other products it feels stuck in the '90s? The difference is vector search— a method of indexing and searching through large volumes of vector embeddings to find more relevant search results and recommendations.<br>
<br>
Dave Bergstein, the Director of Product at Pinecone, joins us to describe how vector search is used by companies today, what are the challenges of deploying vector search to production applications, and how teams can overcome those challenges even without the engineering resources of Facebook or Spotify.<br>
<br>
// Bio Dave <br>
Bergstein is Director of Product at Pinecone. Dave previously held senior product roles at Tesseract Health and MathWorks where he was deeply involved with productionalizing AI. Dave holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Boston University studying photonics. When not helping customers solve their AI challenges, Dave enjoys walking his dog Zeus and CrossFit.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #50 with Alex Chung and Srivathsan Canchi, Creating MLOps Standards.<br>
<br>
// Abstract<br>
With the explosion in tools and opinionated frameworks for machine learning, it's very hard to define standards and best practices for MLOps and ML platforms. Based on their building AWS SageMaker and Intuit's ML Platform respectively, Alex Chung and Srivathsan Canchi talk with Demetrios and Vishnu about their experience navigating "tooling sprawl". They discuss their efforts to solve this problem organizationally with Social Good Technologies and technically with mlctl, the control plane for MLOps.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Alex Chung<br>
Alex is a former Senior Product Manager at AWS Sagemaker and an ML Data Strategy and Ops lead at Facebook. He's passionate about the interoperability of MLOps tooling for enterprises as an avenue to accelerate the industry.<br>
<br>
Srivathsan Canchi<br>
Srivathsan leads the machine learning platform engineering team at Intuit. The ML platform includes real-time distributed featurization, scoring, and feedback loops. He has a breadth of experience building high scale mission-critical platforms. Srivathsan also has extensive experience with K8s at Intuit and previously at eBay, where his team was responsible for building a PaaS on top of K8s and OpenStack.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #49 with Stefan Krawczyk, Aggressively Helpful Platform Teams.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
At Stitch Fix there are 130+ “Full Stack Data Scientists” who in addition to doing data science work, are also expected to engineer and own data pipelines for their production models. One data science team, the Forecasting, Estimation, and Demand team were in a bind. Their data generation process was causing them iteration &amp; operational frustrations in delivering time-series forecasts for the business. the solution? Hamilton, a novel python micro-framework, solved their pain points by changing their working paradigm.<br>
<br>
Some of the main workers on Hamilton are the dedicated engineering team called Data Platform. Data Platform builds services, tools, and abstractions to enable DS to operate in a full-stack manner avoiding hand-off. In the beginning, this meant DS built the web apps to serve model predictions, now as the layers of abstractions have been built over time, they still dictate what is deployed, but write much less code.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Stefan loves the stimulus of working at the intersection of design, engineering, and data. He grew up in New Zealand, speaks Polish, and spent formative years at Stanford, LinkedIn, Nextdoor &amp; Idibon. Outside of work in pre-covid times Stefan liked to 🏊, 🌮, 🍺, and ✈.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Julien Chaumond <br>
[01:57] Julien's background in tech <br>
[04:35] "I have this vision of building a community where the greatest people in AI can come together and basically invent the future of Machine Learning together." <br>
[04:55] What is Hugging Face? <br>
[06:17] "We have the goal of bridging the gap between research and production on actual production use cases." <br>
[06:45] Start of open-source in Hugging Face <br>
[07:50] Chatbox experiment (reference resolution system) - linking pronouns to the subjects of sentences <br>
[10:20] From a project to a company <br>
[11:46] "The goal was to explore in the beginning." <br>
[11:57] Importance of platform <br>
[14:25] "Transfer learning is an efficient way of Machine Learning. Providing your platform &nbsp;around change that people want to start from pre-trained model and fine-tune them into the specific use case is something that can be big so we built some stuff to help people do that." <br>
[15:35] Narrowing down the scope of service to provide <br>
[16:27] "We have some vision of what we want to build but a lot of it is the small incremental improvements that we bring to the platform. I think it's the natural way of building stuff nowadays because Machine Learning is moving so fast." <br>
[20:00] Model Hubs <br>
[22:37] "We're guaranteeing that we don't build anything that introduces any lagging to Hugging Face because we're using Github. You'll have that peace of mind." <br>
[26:31] Storing model artifacts <br>
[27:00] AWS - cache - stored to an edge location all around the globe <br>
[28:39] Inference widgets powering <br>
[27:17] "For each model on the model hub we try to ensure that we have the metadata about the model to be able to actually run it." <br>
[32:11] Deploying infra function <br>
[32:38] "Depending on the model and library, we optimize the custom containers to make sure that they run as fast as possible on the target hardware that we have." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
[34:59] "Machine Learning is still pretty much hardware dependent." <br>
[36:11] Hardware usage <br>
[39:04] "CPU is super cheap. If you are able to run Berks served with a 1-millisecond on CPU because you have powerful optimizations, you don't really need GPUs anymore. It's cost-efficient and energy-efficient." &nbsp;<br>
[40:30] Challenges of Hugging Face and what you learned <br>
[41:10] "It may sound like a super cliche but the team that you assembled is everything." <br>
[43:22] War stories in Hugging Face <br>
[44:12] "Our goal is more forward-looking to be helpful as much as we can to the community." <br>
[48:25] Hugging Face accessibility</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #47 with Jeremy Howard, fast.ai, AutoML, Software Engineering for ML.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
Advancement in ML Workflows: You've been around the ML world for long enough to have seen how much workflows, tooling, frameworks, etc. have matured and allowed for greater scale and access. We'd love to reflect on your personal journey in this regard and hear about your early experiences putting models into production, as well as how you appreciate/might improve the process now.<br>
<br>
Data Professional Diversity and MLOps: Your work at fast.ai, Kaggle, and now with NBDEV has played a huge part in supercharging a diverse ecosystem of professionals that contribute to ML-like ML/data scientists, researchers, and ML engineers. As the attention turns to putting models into production, how do you think this range of professionals will evolve and work together? How will things around building models change as we build more?<br>
<br>
Turning Research into Practice: You've consistently been a leader in applying cutting-edge ideas from academia into practical code others can use. It's one of the things I appreciate most about the fast.ai course and package. How do you go about picking which ideas to invest in? What advice would you give to industry practitioners charged with a similar task at their company?<br>
<br>

We&apos;d love to reflect on your personal journey in this regard and hear about your early experiences putting models into production, as well as how you appreciate/might improve the process now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Data Professional Diversity and MLOps: Your work at fast.ai, Kaggle, and now with NBDEV has played a huge part in supercharging a diverse ecosystem of professionals that contribute to ML-like ML/data scientists, researchers, and ML engineers. As the attention turns to putting models into production, how do you think this range of professionals will evolve and work together? How will things around building models change as we build more?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Turning Research into Practice: You&apos;ve consistently been a leader in applying cutting-edge ideas from academia into practical code others can use. It&apos;s one of the things I appreciate most about the fast.ai course and package. How do you go about picking which ideas to invest in? What advice would you give to industry practitioners charged with a similar task at their company?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #46 with Pablo Estevez, What We Learned from 150 Successful ML-enabled Products at <a href="//">Booking.com.</a><br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
While most of the Machine Learning literature focuses on the algorithmic or mathematical aspects of the field, not much has been published about how Machine Learning can deliver meaningful impact in an industrial environment where commercial gains are paramount. We conducted an analysis on about 150 successful customer-facing applications of Machine Learning, developed by dozens of teams in Booking.com, exposed to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, and validated through rigorous Randomized Controlled Trials. Our main conclusion is that an iterative, hypothesis-driven process, integrated with other disciplines was fundamental to build 150 successful products enabled by Machine Learning.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Machine Learning in Cyber Security // Monika Venckauskaite // MLOps Meetup #70]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #70! Last Wednesday, we talked to Monika Venckauskaite, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Vinted.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
One of the areas, that is the most transformed by ML these years is cybersecurity. Traditionally, SIEM (Security Intelligence and Event Management) is performed by human analysts. However, as the cyber powers and tools of the world are growing, we need more and more of these specialists. The entire area of cybersecurity is experiencing a shortage of talent. This is where the ML is coming in to help us. Cybersecurity ML systems require a lot of expertise from specialists as well as unique ways of handling user-sensitive data. This imposes various architectural solutions. In this talk, Monika introduces us to the ways of using ML in cybersecurity and the unique challenges we face.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Monika is a keen and curious ML engineer, loving to build systems. She's started in machine learning as a master's student, looking for Higgs Boson and Dark matter within the CERN data. Later on, Monika moved to the IT industry and worked on various machine learning projects, including Open Source Intelligence Tools and a distributed system for ML cybersecurity analytics.<br>
<br>
Currently, Monika works as an MLOps engineer, improving the MLOps platform that is used in production to shipping models to a 45 million-user platform. Monika also works in a start-up that is innovating satellite communication. In her free time, she loves books, traveling, and playing some music.<br>
<br>
// Takeaways<br>
Cyber threats are all around us. ML as technology is both a savior and a threat.<br>
GDPR and sensitive user data bring in extra challenges for cybersecurity intelligence systems, leading to more complex architectural decisions.<br>
ML helps to fight the talent shortage.<br>
Cybersecurity requires real-time ML systems and reacting ASAP.<br>

[00:00] Thank you Diego and Algorithmia for sponsoring this session! <br>
[01:04] Introduction to Diego Oppenheimer <br>
[02:55] Security <br>
[04:42] "The level of scrutiny for apps and development and that of the operational software is much higher." <br>
[07:40] "We take the Ops part of MLOps very, very seriously and it's really about the operational side of the equation." <br>
[09:22] MLSecOps <br>
[11:42] "The code doesn't change, but things change cause the data changed." <br>
[15:23] Maturity of security <br>
[18:45] "To a certain degree, we have general parameters of software DevOps In software engineering and DevOps, and we're adapting it to this new world of ML." &nbsp;<br>
[19:03] Development workflow <br>
[20:58] "In the ideal world, you're just sitting in your data science platform, your auto ML platform, whatever it is that you're working with, you can push a model." <br>
[22:50] Security, responsibility and authentication <br>
[23:38] "What you don't want to learn is how to do automation every single time there's a new use case. That's just not a good use of your time." &nbsp;[24:30] Hurdles needed to be cleared <br>
[24:47] "I would argue that there's no such thing as Bulletproof in software. That doesn't exist. It never has and never will." <br>
[26:25] Machine Learning security risks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Operational risk<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Brand risk<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Strategic risk<br>
[28:23] Machine Learning security risk standards <br>
[31:11] "There's a world where you can reverse engineer a model by essentially feeding a whole bunch of data and understanding where that comes back."<br>
[33:55] How to change the mindset of relaxed companies when it comes to security <br>
[35:19] "It takes time and money to figure out security."<br>
[37:52] Conscientious when building systems <br>
[39:44] "Look at the end result of the workflow and understand the value of that workflow, which you should know at that point because if you're going into an ML workflow without understanding what the end value is going to be, it's not a good sign." <br>
[40:19] Root cause analysis <br>
[41:00] Threat modeling <br>
[41:14] "There's a natural next step where there's threat modeling for ML systems and it's a task that gets built and understood, and nobody's going to enjoy doing it." &nbsp;<br>
[43:07] Security as code<br>
[45:29] MLRE</p>

Timestamps: &lt;br&gt;
[00:00] Thank you Diego and Algorithmia for sponsoring this session! &lt;br&gt;
[01:04] Introduction to Diego Oppenheimer &lt;br&gt;
[02:55] Security &lt;br&gt;
[04:42] &quot;The level of scrutiny for apps and development and that of the operational software is much higher.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[07:40] &quot;We take the Ops part of MLOps very, very seriously and it&apos;s really about the operational side of the equation.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[09:22] MLSecOps &lt;br&gt;
[11:42] &quot;The code doesn&apos;t change, but things change cause the data changed.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[15:23] Maturity of security &lt;br&gt;
[18:45] &quot;To a certain degree, we have general parameters of software DevOps In software engineering and DevOps, and we&apos;re adapting it to this new world of ML.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[19:03] Development workflow &lt;br&gt;
[20:58] &quot;In the ideal world, you&apos;re just sitting in your data science platform, your auto ML platform, whatever it is that you&apos;re working with, you can push a model.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[22:50] Security, responsibility and authentication &lt;br&gt;
[23:38] &quot;What you don&apos;t want to learn is how to do automation every single time there&apos;s a new use case. That&apos;s just not a good use of your time.&quot; &amp;nbsp;[24:30] Hurdles needed to be cleared &lt;br&gt;
[24:47] &quot;I would argue that there&apos;s no such thing as Bulletproof in software. That doesn&apos;t exist. It never has and never will.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[26:25] Machine Learning security risks &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Operational risk&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Brand risk&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3. Strategic risk&lt;br&gt;
[28:23] Machine Learning security risk standards &lt;br&gt;
[31:11] &quot;There&apos;s a world where you can reverse engineer a model by essentially feeding a whole bunch of data and understanding where that comes back.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[33:55] How to change the mindset of relaxed companies when it comes to security &lt;br&gt;
[35:19] &quot;It takes time and money to figure out security.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[37:52] Conscientious when building systems &lt;br&gt;
[39:44] &quot;Look at the end result of the workflow and understand the value of that workflow, which you should know at that point because if you&apos;re going into an ML workflow without understanding what the end value is going to be, it&apos;s not a good sign.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[40:19] Root cause analysis &lt;br&gt;
[41:00] Threat modeling &lt;br&gt;
[41:14] &quot;There&apos;s a natural next step where there&apos;s threat modeling for ML systems and it&apos;s a task that gets built and understood, and nobody&apos;s going to enjoy doing it.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[43:07] Security as code&lt;br&gt;
[45:29] MLRE&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Autonomy vs. Alignment: Scaling AI teams to deliver value // Grant Wright // MLOps Coffee Sessions #44]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #44 with Grant Wright of SEEK Ltd., Autonomy vs. Alignment: Scaling AI Teams to Deliver Value.<br>
<br>
/Abstract <br>
Setting AI teams up for success can be difficult, especially when you’re trying to balance the need to provide teams with autonomy to innovate and solve interesting problems while ensuring they are aligned to the organizations' strategy. Operating models, rituals and processes can really help to set teams up for success; but, there is no right answer, and as you scale and priorities change your approach needs to change too.<br>
<br>
Grant shares some of his learnings in establishing a cross-functional team of data scientists, engineers, analysts, product managers, and otologists to solve employment information problems at SEEK, and how the team has evolved as they’ve scaled from a team of 30 in Melbourne Australia to over 100 team members across 5 countries in the past three years.<br>
<br>
// Bio <br>
Grant heads the Artificial Intelligence &amp; Product Analytics teams at SEEK, where he leads a global team of over 120 Data Scientists, Software Engineers, Ontologists, and AI Product Managers who deliver AI Services to online employment and education platforms across the Asia Pacific and the Americas.<br>
<br>
Grant has held various strategy and product and tech leadership roles over the past 15 years, with experience in scaling, AI teams to deliver outcomes across multiple geographies.<br>
<br>
Grant holds a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science (Software Development) and a Bachelor of Business (Economics) from the Auckland University of Technology.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[How Pinterest Powers Image Similarity // Shaji Chennan Kunnummel // System Design Reviews #1]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this Machine Learning System Design Review, Shaji Chennan Kunnummel walks us through the system design for Pinterest’s near-real-time architecture for detecting similar images. We discuss their usage of Kafka, Flink, rocksdb, and much more. Starting with the high-level requirements for the system, we discussed Pinterest’s focus on debuggability and an easy transition from their batch processing system to stream processing. We then touch on the different system interfaces and components involved such as Manas—Pinterest’s custom search engine—and how it all ends up in their custom graph database, downstream Kafka streams, and to Pinterest’s feature store—Galaxy. With Shaji’s expert knowledge of the system, we were able to do a deep dive into the system’s architecture and some of its components.<br>
<br>
// Experiences <br>
15+ years of experience in software product development. <br>
Led multiple teams in a highly agile, collaborative, and cross-functional environment. <br>
Designed and implemented highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and optimized distributed systems that scale to handle millions of requests per second. In-depth knowledge of Object-oriented programming and design patterns in C++/Java/Python/Golang. <br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps community meetup #68! Last Wednesday we talked to Veselina Staneva of TeachableHub, Simarpal Khaira of Intuit, and Korri Jones of Chick-fil-A, Inc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Abstract&lt;br&gt;
Building, Designing, or even just casting the vision for MLOps for your company, whether a large corporation or an agile start-up up, shouldn&apos;t be a nigh-impossible task. Complex, but not an impossible mountain to climb. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this meetup, we talked about the steps necessary to unlock the potential of data science for your organization, regardless of size.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Bio&lt;br&gt;
Veselina Staneva - Co-founder &amp;amp; Head of Product, TeachableHub&lt;br&gt;
Over the past few years, Vesi work at a product company called CloudStrap.io, where together with her team they are simplifying cloud technologies and crafting modern solutions that lay a solid foundation for digital transformation at scale.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Vesi&apos;s main focus currently is their new product TeachableHub.com - an ML deployment and serving platform for teams, where she heads Product and Customer Development. In the past, Vesi had quite a diverse experience in managing projects for global enterprise companies such as telecommunications and internet service provider GTT and managed printing services giant HPInc, as well as deep-diving into e-commerce business development while running online stores on 7 Amazon markets as well as WordPress shops, where she managed to get from 0 to $30K MRR in less than a year without a dollar spent on paid advertising.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In Vesi&apos;s free time, she enjoys spending the rest of her energy doing all kinds of sports, as well as participate in non-professional triathlons and mountain bike ultra races.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Simarpal Khaira - Senior Product Manager, Intuit&lt;br&gt;
Simarpal is the product manager driving product strategy for Feature Management and Machine Learning tools at Intuit. Prior to Intuit, he was at Ayasdi, a machine learning startup, leading product efforts for machine learning solutions in the financial services space. Before that, he worked at Adobe as a product manager for Audience Manager, a data management platform for digital marketing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Korri Jones - Senior Lead Machine Learning Engineer, Chick-fil-A, Inc.&lt;br&gt;
Korri Jones is a Sr Lead Machine Learning Engineer and Innovation Coach at Chick-fil-A, Inc. in Atlanta, Georgia where he is focused on MLOps. Prior to his work at Chick-fil-A, he worked as a Business Analyst and product trainer for NavMD, Inc., was an adjunct professor at Roane State Community College, and instructor for the Project GRAD summer program at Pellissippi State Community College and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Korri&apos;s accolades are just as diverse, and he was in the inaugural 40 under 40 for the University of Tennessee in 2021, Volunteer of the year with the Urban League of Greater Atlanta with over 1000 hours in a single calendar year and has received the “Looking to the Future” award within his department at Chick-fil-A among many others, including best speaker awards in business case competitions. &amp;nbsp;However, the best award he has received so far is being a loving husband to his wife Lydia.&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #43 with Kyle Gallatin of Etsy, Maturing Machine Learning in Enterprise.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
The definition of Data Science in production has evolved dramatically in recent years. Despite increasing investments in MLOps, many organizations still struggle to deliver ML quickly and effectively. They often fail to recognize an ML project as a massively cross-functional initiative and confuse deployment with production. Kyle will talk about both the functional and non-functional requirements of production ML, and the organizational challenges that can inhibit companies from delivering value with ML.<br>
<br>
// Bio<br>
Kyle Gallatin is currently a Software Engineer for Machine Learning Infrastructure at Etsy. He primarily focuses on operationalizing the training, deployment, and management of machine learning models at scale. Prior to Etsy, Kyle delivered ML microservices and lead the development of MLOps workflows at the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. In his spare time, Kyle mentors data scientists and writes ML blog posts for Towards Data Science.<br>

// Takeaways<br>
Data science is still poorly defined and there is a large variance in organizational maturity &nbsp;<br>
Basically, everything we need for mature ML in modern organizations exists technically except for the strategy, mentality, organization, and governance<br>
Organizations who poorly define data science often overburden their data scientists, but there are expectations that data scientists know some engineering<br>
Operationalizing data science is not that different from software engineering, and software engineering can be one of the most valuable skill sets for a data scientist.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Alfredo Deza<br>
[03:00] Alfredo's background in tech<br>
[13:15] Who is this book for?<br>
[14:15] "The reason why we need a Machine Learning book is that there's definitely a knowledge gap."<br>
[16:05] Hierarchy of MLOps<br>
[17:16] "Automation has to be the basis of pretty much, everything."<br>
[19:03] Logging - "When in doubt, log it out!"<br>
[24:50] Maturity<br>
[29:55] "The notion of self-healing is very appealing."<br>
[31:20] Learning Test<br>
[37:40] "Catch things as early as possible. Anything that comes at the end of the process, the closer you are to the production, the more expensive it could get." &nbsp;<br>
[37:54] "Expensive can be the dollar amount in engineering time, or it can be the dollar amount in services that you're using to produce, and the dollar amount on how long it would take to ship the version that fixes the problem."<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Kseniia Melnikova <br>
[02:00] MLOps World Conference Announcement <br>
[03:40] AI Development process: Common Mistakes <br>
[07:45] Step 1: Planning <br>
[07:48] Mistake #1: Personal Decisions - Teamwork <br>
[08:31] Mistake #1: Cases <br>
[09:00] Mistake #1: Solution <br>
[11:52] Scrum <br>
[12:50] "In Scrum, it's hard to plan because especially in research, you don't know which result affects new tasks that's why it might be a little slow for Machine Learning." <br>
[14:28] Step 2: Data Processing <br>
[14:34] Mistake #2: Chaos with Datasets <br>
[15:26] Mistake #2: Cases <br>
[16:48] Mistake #2: Solution <br>
[20:12] Step 3: Experiments <br>
[20:21] Mistake #3: Lack of Experiments Tracking <br>
[22:13] Mistake #3: Case - Manual Experiments Tracking <br>
[24:10] Mistake #3: Solutions <br>
[25:57] Experiments Tracking Tools Example: MLFlow UI <br>
[26:46] Awareness of Existing Tools <br>
[28:21] Tools' Features <br>
[29:21] Possible Combination <br>
[29:48] Another Possible Combination <br>
[30:24] Best Practice <br>
[31:42] Mistake #0: Lack of Information Sharing <br>
[32:26] Mistake #0: Solution - Organize more meetings/standups! &nbsp;<br>
[34:18] Find Your Mistakes <br>
[34:41] Mistake #0: Solution - Organize more meetings/standups! &nbsp;<br>
[35:35] Audio Data <br>
[39:32] Experiment tracking of only 1 ML engineer <br>
[41:38] "I prefer reproducibility tools because it's automatic and it also takes a lot of time to manually upload the results into conference." <br>
[43:03] AI Development Check-list <br>
[43:40] Check-list Results <br>
[44:52] "I think it's always interesting to rate yourself to share the results with other people to compete out of it." <br>
[45:10] Why to Implement <br>
[45:17] "If we have more automation on experimentations for data sets versioning, it will lead to less manual work." <br>
[45:28] "AI Development process implementation will have the possibility to reproduce and compare experiments." <br>
[45:37] "AI Development process implementation will make you comfortable on solving the issues you'll face every day." <br>
[45:52] "AI Development process implementation will lead to a faster commercialization cycle because you will take less time on the process and more time for the results." <br>
[46:03] "If we will take all the principles of AI Development process implementation, it will lead to easy communication between team members. You'll gain trust, have great teamwork, and everyone will have respect for each other." &nbsp;<br>
[46:50] War stories prior to having AI Development process<br>
[49:50] Calculating the lost money</p>

[00:00] Introduction to Kseniia Melnikova &lt;br&gt;
[02:00] MLOps World Conference Announcement &lt;br&gt;
[03:40] AI Development process: Common Mistakes &lt;br&gt;
[07:45] Step 1: Planning &lt;br&gt;
[07:48] Mistake #1: Personal Decisions - Teamwork &lt;br&gt;
[08:31] Mistake #1: Cases &lt;br&gt;
[09:00] Mistake #1: Solution &lt;br&gt;
[11:52] Scrum &lt;br&gt;
[12:50] &quot;In Scrum, it&apos;s hard to plan because especially in research, you don&apos;t know which result affects new tasks that&apos;s why it might be a little slow for Machine Learning.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[14:28] Step 2: Data Processing &lt;br&gt;
[14:34] Mistake #2: Chaos with Datasets &lt;br&gt;
[15:26] Mistake #2: Cases &lt;br&gt;
[16:48] Mistake #2: Solution &lt;br&gt;
[20:12] Step 3: Experiments &lt;br&gt;
[20:21] Mistake #3: Lack of Experiments Tracking &lt;br&gt;
[22:13] Mistake #3: Case - Manual Experiments Tracking &lt;br&gt;
[24:10] Mistake #3: Solutions &lt;br&gt;
[25:57] Experiments Tracking Tools Example: MLFlow UI &lt;br&gt;
[26:46] Awareness of Existing Tools &lt;br&gt;
[28:21] Tools&apos; Features &lt;br&gt;
[29:21] Possible Combination &lt;br&gt;
[29:48] Another Possible Combination &lt;br&gt;
[30:24] Best Practice &lt;br&gt;
[31:42] Mistake #0: Lack of Information Sharing &lt;br&gt;
[32:26] Mistake #0: Solution - Organize more meetings/standups! &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[34:18] Find Your Mistakes &lt;br&gt;
[34:41] Mistake #0: Solution - Organize more meetings/standups! &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[35:35] Audio Data &lt;br&gt;
[39:32] Experiment tracking of only 1 ML engineer &lt;br&gt;
[41:38] &quot;I prefer reproducibility tools because it&apos;s automatic and it also takes a lot of time to manually upload the results into conference.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[43:03] AI Development Check-list &lt;br&gt;
[43:40] Check-list Results &lt;br&gt;
[44:52] &quot;I think it&apos;s always interesting to rate yourself to share the results with other people to compete out of it.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[45:10] Why to Implement &lt;br&gt;
[45:17] &quot;If we have more automation on experimentations for data sets versioning, it will lead to less manual work.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[45:28] &quot;AI Development process implementation will have the possibility to reproduce and compare experiments.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[45:37] &quot;AI Development process implementation will make you comfortable on solving the issues you&apos;ll face every day.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[45:52] &quot;AI Development process implementation will lead to a faster commercialization cycle because you will take less time on the process and more time for the results.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[46:03] &quot;If we will take all the principles of AI Development process implementation, it will lead to easy communication between team members. You&apos;ll gain trust, have great teamwork, and everyone will have respect for each other.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[46:50] War stories prior to having AI Development process&lt;br&gt;
[49:50] Calculating the lost money&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Model Performance Monitoring and Why You Need it Yesterday // Amit Paka // MLOps Coffee Sessions #42]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #42 with Amit Paka of Fiddler AI, Model Performance Monitoring.</p>
<p>//Abstract<br>
Machine Learning accelerates business growth but is prone to performance degradation due to its high reliance on data. Moreover, MLOps is often fragmented in many organizations, causing frictions to debug models in production. With new rules from the EU that focus on trust and transparency, it’s becoming more important to keep track of model performance. But how? We propose a new framework, a centralized ML Model Performance Management powered by Explainable AI. Learn more about how you can stay compliant while maximizing your model performance at all times with explainability and continuous monitoring.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Amit is the co-founder and CPO of Fiddler, a Machine Learning Monitoring company that empowers companies to efficiently monitor and troubleshoot ML models with Explainable AI. Prior to founding Fiddler, Paka led the shopping apps product team at Samsung. Paka founded Parable, the Creative Photo Network, now part of the Samsung family. He also led PayPal's consumer in-store mobile payments launching innovations like hardware beacon payments and has developed successful startup products particularly in online advertising - paid search, a contextual, ad exchange, and display advertising. Paka has passions for actualizing new concepts, building great teams, and pushing the envelope, and aims to leverage these skills to help define how AI can be fair, ethical, and responsible.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[CI/CD in MLOPS // Monmayuri Ray // MLOps Coffee Sessions #41]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #41 with Monmayuri Ray of Gitlab, CI/CD in MLOPS.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
We all are familiar with the concept of MVP. In the world of DevOps, one is also familiar with Minimal Viable Feature and further Minimal Viable change. CI/CD is the orchestrator and the underlying base to enable automated experimentation, to start small, and build an idea for production. Now if we use the same fundamentals in MLOps, what does that mean?<br>
<br>
The podcast will take the audience on a journey in understanding the fundamentals of orchestrating machine predictions using responsible CI/CD in MLOps in this ever-changing, agile world of software development. One shall hope to learn how to excel at the craft of CI for Machine Learning (ML), lowering the cost of deployment through a robust CI/CD/CT/CF framework.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Monmayuri is an advisor, &nbsp;data scientist, and researcher specializing in MLops/DevOps at GitLab in Sydney. She builds creative, products to solve challenges for companies in industries as diverse as financial services, healthcare, and human capital.<br>
<br>
Along the way, Mon has built expertise in Natural Language Processing, scalable feature engineering, MLOps transformation and digitization, and the humanization of technology. With a background in applied mathematics in biomedical engineering, she likes to describe the essence of AI as “low-cost prediction” and MLOps as “low-cost transaction” and believes the world needs the collaboration of poets, historians, artists, psychoanalysts and scientists, engineers to unlock the potential of these emerging technologies where one works in making a machine think like humans and be efficient automated fortune tellers.<br>
<br>
//Takeaways<br>
Key Takeaways include how to incorporate the best CI/CD practice in your MLOPS lifecycle. Things to do and things not to do. How best to get the DevOps engineer, ML engineer, and data scientists to speak the same language and automate CI for pipeline and models.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Christopher Bergh <br>
[02:57] MLOps community in partnership with MLOps World Conference <br>
[04:34] Chris' Background <br>
[07:59] "When we started with the company, I realized that the problem I have is generalizable to everyone. I'm getting enough there in years and I wanted to remove the amount of pain that other people have." <br>
[09:53] DataOps vs MLOps <br>

&lt;br&gt;
//Abstract&lt;br&gt;
Working on a shared technically difficult problem there will be some things that are important no matter what industry you are in. Whether it&apos;s building cars in a factory, using agile or scrum methodology, or productionizing ML models you need a few basics. Chris gives us some of his best practices in the conversation.&lt;br&gt;

[00:00] Introduction to Christopher Bergh &lt;br&gt;
[02:57] MLOps community in partnership with MLOps World Conference &lt;br&gt;
[04:34] Chris&apos; Background &lt;br&gt;
[07:59] &quot;When we started with the company, I realized that the problem I have is generalizable to everyone. I&apos;m getting enough there in years and I wanted to remove the amount of pain that other people have.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[09:53] DataOps vs MLOps &lt;br&gt;
[10:15] &quot;I don&apos;t really honestly care what Ops you use, right? Hahaha! Call it your favorite Ops &apos;cause first of all as an engineer, I want precise definitions. I look at it from a completely odd-ball way so you could call it whatever Ops term you want.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[12:45] Best practices of companies &lt;br&gt;
[14:16] &quot;When that code runs in production, monitor and check to see if it&apos;s right. Absorb it, monitor it because the model could go out of tune. The data going into it could be wrong. The data transformation could break. Shit happens and don&apos;t trust your data providers.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[19:00] The whole is still greater than its part&lt;br&gt;
[20:26] &quot;It is harder to focus on the results than just under a piece of the task. Don&apos;t spend too much time on doing the wrong thing.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[23:50] DevOps Principles and Agile&lt;br&gt;
[27:17] DataOps Manifesto - DataOps is Data Management reborn &lt;br&gt;
[27:45] &quot;The &apos;Ops&apos; term is ending up encompassing the work that you do in addition to the system you build to do the work.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[30:45] Standardization &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[32:22] &quot;I think that there&apos;s a lack of perception of the need to spend time on doing the operations part of the equation.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[34:15] Tools as lego blocks &lt;br&gt;
[34:49] &quot;Good interphases make good neighbors.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[36:23] &quot;Standards can help but they&apos;re not the panacea.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[36:30] Cultural side - You build it, you own it, you ship it&lt;br&gt;
[39:28] Value chain&lt;br&gt;
[44:19] Ripple effect of testing&lt;br&gt;
[48:03] Google on &quot;One tool to rule them all&quot;&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #63! Last Wednesday we talked to Felipe Campos Penha, Senior Data Scientist, Cargill.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
Can one learn anything useful by creating content online? The usual answer is a sounding YES. But what about live coding an MLOps project on Twitch? Can anything good come out of it?<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Felipe Penha creates content about Data Science regularly on the Data Science Bits channel on YouTube and Twitch. He has 8+ years of experience with hands-on data-related work, starting with his doctorate in Astroparticle Physics. His career in the private sector has been devoted to bringing value to various segments of the Food and Beverages Industry through the use of Analytics and Machine Learning.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Felipe Campos Penha<br>
[01:30] Felipe's background<br>
[05:36] Developing models in physics vs developing models for companies<br>
[08:07] Felipe's transition from Jupyter Notebook to Operational ML<br>
[09:34] "The thought of business basically for customers, they always wanted to see the value and try to roll out more manual work like spreadsheets so they could try out that model on the field."<br>
[12:07] Felipe's software engineering development learning<br>
[14:10] Catalyst on Youtube and Twitch<br>
[18:06] Elements of Twitch<br>
[20:02] Non-polished versions of Twitch<br>
[21:16] "Twitch was not made for coding, it was for gamers."<br>
[26:17] Felipe's audience impact on Twitch<br>
[28:02] Logistical pieces<br>
[30:43] Words of wisdom on live streaming<br>
[30:56] "Don't be afraid to start. There are many streamers that are actually learning from scratch and they are showing the process of learning online. They are learning faster because the help is faster."<br>
[33:16] Blog post as other means to Twitch<br>
[33:50] "I'm a perfectionist when I'm writing. The shortest it is, the hardest it could get. You want to polish it a lot to make nice figures. I learned a lot but for me, I feel that process is too slow because you're thinking about one subject for a long time trying to polish it while in live streaming, it's very dynamic and fast."<br>
[34:25] Twitch affecting Felipe's career<br>
[36:36] "Exposing yourself, showing your mistakes, vocalizing your thoughts, I think all of this makes you a better programmer." &nbsp;<br>
[37:12] Getting through a problem<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps community meetup #63! Last Wednesday we talked to Felipe Campos Penha, Senior Data Scientist, Cargill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Abstract&lt;br&gt;
Can one learn anything useful by creating content online? The usual answer is a sounding YES. But what about live coding an MLOps project on Twitch? Can anything good come out of it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Bio&lt;br&gt;
Felipe Penha creates content about Data Science regularly on the Data Science Bits channel on YouTube and Twitch. He has 8+ years of experience with hands-on data-related work, starting with his doctorate in Astroparticle Physics. His career in the private sector has been devoted to bringing value to various segments of the Food and Beverages Industry through the use of Analytics and Machine Learning.&lt;br&gt;

[00:00] Introduction to Felipe Campos Penha&lt;br&gt;
[01:30] Felipe&apos;s background&lt;br&gt;
[05:36] Developing models in physics vs developing models for companies&lt;br&gt;
[08:07] Felipe&apos;s transition from Jupyter Notebook to Operational ML&lt;br&gt;
[09:34] &quot;The thought of business basically for customers, they always wanted to see the value and try to roll out more manual work like spreadsheets so they could try out that model on the field.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[12:07] Felipe&apos;s software engineering development learning&lt;br&gt;
[14:10] Catalyst on Youtube and Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[18:06] Elements of Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[20:02] Non-polished versions of Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[21:16] &quot;Twitch was not made for coding, it was for gamers.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[26:17] Felipe&apos;s audience impact on Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[28:02] Logistical pieces&lt;br&gt;
[30:43] Words of wisdom on live streaming&lt;br&gt;
[30:56] &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid to start. There are many streamers that are actually learning from scratch and they are showing the process of learning online. They are learning faster because the help is faster.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[33:16] Blog post as other means to Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[33:50] &quot;I&apos;m a perfectionist when I&apos;m writing. The shortest it is, the hardest it could get. You want to polish it a lot to make nice figures. I learned a lot but for me, I feel that process is too slow because you&apos;re thinking about one subject for a long time trying to polish it while in live streaming, it&apos;s very dynamic and fast.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[34:25] Twitch affecting Felipe&apos;s career&lt;br&gt;
[36:36] &quot;Exposing yourself, showing your mistakes, vocalizing your thoughts, I think all of this makes you a better programmer.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[37:12] Getting through a problem&lt;br&gt;
[39:41] Recommended streamers that caught Felipe&apos;s interest&lt;br&gt;
[41:00] Community aspect and importance of Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[42:42] Role of community on Twitch&lt;br&gt;
[45:16] &quot;Twitch is becoming such a trend that even companies are following.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Law of Diminishing Returns for Running AI Proof-of-Concepts // Oguzhan Gencoglu // MLOps Meetup #62]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #62! Last Wednesday we talked to Oguzhan Gencoglu, Co-founder &amp; Head of AI, Top Data Science.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
Starting the AI adoption with AI Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) is the most common choice for most companies. Yet, a significant percentage of AI PoCs do not make it into production whether they were successful or not. Furthermore, running yet another AI PoC follows the law of diminishing returns in various aspects. This talk will revolve around this theme.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Oguzhan "Ouz" Gencoglu is the Co-founder and Head of AI at Top Data Science, a Helsinki-based AI consultancy. With his team, he delivered more than 70 machine learning solutions in numerous industries for the past 5 years. Before that, he used to conduct machine learning research in several countries including the USA, Czech Republic, Turkey, Denmark, and Finland. Oguzhan has given more than 40 talks on machine learning to audiences of various backgrounds.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Oguzhan Gencoglu<br>
[00:47] Ouz's background<br>
[01:47] Recurring/repetitive problem patterns<br>
[03:16] "When you solve a repetitive task in an automatic way, that's Scalability."<br>
[04:32] Evolution expected of Machine Learning<br>
[05:10] "People are quite confused about the titles and what's worst, those titles don't have a common definition in different companies. If you feel a little bit overwhelmed, that's normal."<br>
[08:04] Proof-of-Concepts<br>
[10:35] Successful PoCs but not Productionized<br>
[16:03] Productionize as soon as possible<br>
[16:47] "In your Proof-of-Concepts, it's not only technical, but it's also a mindset."<br>
[20:00] Framework of a successful PoCs<br>
[24:28] Taking too much on PoCs<br>
[28:05] Proof-of-Concepts after Proof-of-Concepts and Proof-of-Concepts hell<br>
[31:30] Wholistic view<br>
[34:00] Operationalizing PoCs<br>
[37:17] "The teams also need to adjust themselves to these new tools, new paradigms, and the different needs of the whole industry." &nbsp;<br>
[37:26] Horror stories<br>
[39:54] Open communication tips<br>
43:31] "Open communication should not only be from the technical perspective but also down to the business and strategy perspective."<br>
[44:20] Translation tips<br>
[44:39] "I believe the most crucial part of today's ML scientists' role is not building a machine learning model but translating a real-life problem into a machine learning problem. It's crucial because it's a scarce talent and skill."<br>
[49:30] Realistic budget for small PoCs<br>
[50:18] "You need at least 1 month of work of proof of value but that doesn't mean things will go to production."<br>
[51:40] Understanding the questions fully<br>
[52:55] "That translation skill is the greatest skill to have in this industry because you can't auto ML that or whatever. It stands the test of time because that will be needed all the time."<br>

			<title><![CDATA[From Idea to Production ML // Lex Beattie - Michael Munn - Mike Moran // MLOps Meetup #61]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #61! Last Wednesday we talked to Lex Beattie, Michael Munn, and Mike Moran.</p>
<p>//Abstract<br>
We started out talking about some of the main bottlenecks they have encountered over the years of trying to push data products into production environments. Then things started to heat up as we dove into the topic of monitoring ML and inevitably the word explainability started being thrown around.<br>
<br>
Turns out Lex is currently doing a Ph.D. on the subject so there was much to talk about. We had to ask if explainability is now table-stakes when it comes to monitoring solutions on the market? The short answer from the team. Yes! &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please excuse the bit of sound trouble we had with google mike at the beginning.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Lex Beattie - ML Engagement Lead, Spotify<br>
In the last year, Lex has helped over 40 different teams across Spotify understand ML best practices, productionize ML workflows and implement impactful ML in their products. Lex is also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oklahoma, focusing on feature importance and interpretability in deep neural networks. Beyond her passion for all things ML, she enjoys exploring the great outdoors in Montana with her German Wirehaired Pointer, Bridger.<br>
<br>
Michael Munn - ML Solutions Engineer, Google<br>
Michael is an ML Solutions Engineer with Google Cloud and Google's Advanced Solutions Lab. In his role, he works with customers to build and deploy end-to-end ML solutions with Google Cloud. Within the Advanced Solutions Lab, he teaches these skills to customers.<br>
<br>
Mike Moran - Principal Engineer, Skyscanner<br>
Mike has worked across many dimensions; in large/tiny companies, back-end/front-end, with many languages, and as a sys-admin /engineer/manager. Mike has a healthy skepticism for most things and likes solving problems through applying System thinking.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps community meetup #61! Last Wednesday we talked to Lex Beattie, Michael Munn, and Mike Moran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//Abstract&lt;br&gt;
We started out talking about some of the main bottlenecks they have encountered over the years of trying to push data products into production environments. Then things started to heat up as we dove into the topic of monitoring ML and inevitably the word explainability started being thrown around.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Turns out Lex is currently doing a Ph.D. on the subject so there was much to talk about. We had to ask if explainability is now table-stakes when it comes to monitoring solutions on the market? The short answer from the team. Yes! &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please excuse the bit of sound trouble we had with google mike at the beginning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Bio&lt;br&gt;
Lex Beattie - ML Engagement Lead, Spotify&lt;br&gt;

Lex is also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oklahoma, focusing on feature importance and interpretability in deep neural networks. Beyond her passion for all things ML, she enjoys exploring the great outdoors in Montana with her German Wirehaired Pointer, Bridger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Michael Munn - ML Solutions Engineer, Google&lt;br&gt;
Michael is an ML Solutions Engineer with Google Cloud and Google&apos;s Advanced Solutions Lab. In his role, he works with customers to build and deploy end-to-end ML solutions with Google Cloud. Within the Advanced Solutions Lab, he teaches these skills to customers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mike Moran - Principal Engineer, Skyscanner&lt;br&gt;
Mike has worked across many dimensions; in large/tiny companies, back-end/front-end, with many languages, and as a sys-admin /engineer/manager. Mike has a healthy skepticism for most things and likes solving problems through applying System thinking.&lt;br&gt;

<br>
//Abstract<br>
The Meme king of MLOps joins us to talk about why we need more MLOps memes and how he got so damn good at being able to zoom out and see things from a metta level them make a meme about it!<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
A researcher first, developer second, in the last 5 years Ariel worked on various projects from the realms of quantum chemistry, massively parallel supercomputing, and deep-learning computer vision. With AllegroAi, he helped build an open-source R&amp;D platform (Allegro Trains), and later went on to lead a data-first transition for a revolutionary nanochemistry startup (StoreDot). Answering his calling to spread the word on state-of-the-art research best practices, He recently took up the mantle of Evangelist at ClearML. Ariel received his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 2014 from the Weizmann Institute of Science. With a broad experience in computational research, he made the transition to the bustling startup scene of Tel-Aviv, and to cutting-edge Deep Learning research.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Luigi in Production Part 2 // Luigi Patruno // MLOps Coffee Sessions #36]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #36 with Luigi Patruno of 2U, Luigi in Production Part 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
Learning Voraciously: We talk a lot in the community about how to learn and upskill in an efficient way. Luigi provided great insight into how he applies certain principles to his learning practices. One tip he shared is to rigorously read and digest books. Luigi himself has used books to address his knowledge gaps in areas like product, finance, etc. I appreciated the emphasis on books. A lot of the reason we feel inundated by new learning resources is that they are online. Emphasizing books, which are often far higher-quality than blog posts, can slow things down and focus our learning. &nbsp;<br>
Leadership Patience: Lately, Luigi has been spending more time managing projects and the data science team at 2U. He shared a lot of his insights into how to manage data science and machine learning properly. One of the most important things he emphasized to us was his patient attitude towards solving problems important to leadership. Turning around organizations is hard work. It's slow, it takes energy, and it is a nonlinear process. As he has course-corrected at various times as a data science leader, Luigi has brought admirable patience to the task, which has helped him be more successful on the things that matter to the entire company. &nbsp;<br>
Communication Flows: It's easy to imagine Luigi as a great communicator, given his experience running MLInProduction.com. In our conversation, he showed us how he puts it to use in his management style. Luigi shared the importance of understanding how communication flows across an organization. Being aware of this is crucial to working on the right, most impactful things. Having a pulse on what different groups and leaders are thinking about can help you evaluate your impact as a team.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[War Stories Productionising ML // Nick Masca // Coffee Session #35]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #35 with Nick Masca of Marks and Spencer, War Stories Productionising ML.<br>
<br>
//Abstract <br>
A conversation with MLOps war stories. Better said, a war story conversation. The kind that informs modern MLOps best practices. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Nick shared how to make MLOps organizational changes at large companies. I loved one tidbit he mentioned--"it's an evolution, not a revolution". That's a frank observation about the speed of practical change. As we all know it doesn't happen overnight. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another great learning Nick shared focused on the value of delivering incremental results regularly. Oftentimes, ML projects suffer because of a focus on delivering too much too soon. This can then lead to a trough of disappointment with the way things actually pan out. Nick shared his experience on how to avoid such pitfalls with us so you don't have to learn the hard way.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Nick currently serves as a Head of Data Science at Marks and Spencer, a large retailer based in the UK. &nbsp;With a background originally in statistics, he transitioned into data science in 2014 and has picked up many battle scars and learnings since.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Coffee Sessions #35 with Nick Masca of Marks and Spencer, War Stories Productionising ML.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Abstract &lt;br&gt;
A conversation with MLOps war stories. Better said, a war story conversation. The kind that informs modern MLOps best practices. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Nick shared how to make MLOps organizational changes at large companies. I loved one tidbit he mentioned--&quot;it&apos;s an evolution, not a revolution&quot;. That&apos;s a frank observation about the speed of practical change. As we all know it doesn&apos;t happen overnight. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another great learning Nick shared focused on the value of delivering incremental results regularly. Oftentimes, ML projects suffer because of a focus on delivering too much too soon. This can then lead to a trough of disappointment with the way things actually pan out. Nick shared his experience on how to avoid such pitfalls with us so you don&apos;t have to learn the hard way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Bio&lt;br&gt;
Nick currently serves as a Head of Data Science at Marks and Spencer, a large retailer based in the UK. &amp;nbsp;With a background originally in statistics, he transitioned into data science in 2014 and has picked up many battle scars and learnings since.&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Deploying Machine Learning Models at Scale in Cloud // Vishnu Prathish // MLOps Meetup #60]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #60! Last Wednesday we talked to Vishnu Prathish, Director Of Engineering, AI Products, Innovyze.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
The way Data Science is done is changing. Notebook sharing and collaboration were messy and there was minimal visibility or QA into the model deployment process. Vishnu will talk about building an ops platform that deploys hundreds of models at-scale every month. A platform that supports typical features of MLOps (CI/CD, Separated QA, Dev and PROD environment, experiments tracking, Isolated retraining, model monitoring in real-time, Automatic Retraining with live data) and ensures quality and observability without compromising the collaborative nature of data science.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
With 10 years in building production-grade data-first software at BBM &amp; HP Labs, I started building Emagin's AI platform about three years ago with the goal of optimizing operations for the water industry. At Innovyze post-acquisition, we are part of the org building world-leading water infrastructure data analytics product.<br>
<br>
//Takeaways<br>
Why is MLOps necessary for model building at scale? &nbsp;<br>
What are various cloud-based models for MLOps? &nbsp;<br>
Where can ops help in various points in the ML pipeline Data Prep, Feature Engineering, Model building, Training, Retraining, Evaluation and inference<br>

[54:22] Metrics on retraining<br>
[56:42] "Retraining is a little less prevalent for our industry compared to a turned prediction model that changes a lot. There are external factors that depend on it but a pump is a pump."</p>

[31:55] How did it evolve? <br>
[35:12] Where is Atlassian now?<br>
[40:21] "Architecturally, Tecton is very very similar (to ours), it was just way more mature." <br>
[41:17] What unleashed you to do now? <br>
[41:36] "The biggest thing is independence from a data science perspective. Less reliance and less dependence on an army of engineers to help deploy features and models." <br>
[44:25] Have you bought other tools? <br>
[45:43] "At any given time, there's something that's a bottleneck. Look where the bottleneck is, then fix it and move on to the next thing." &nbsp;<br>
[48:20] Atlassian bringing a model into production <br>
[50:01] "When we undertake whatever the project is, its days or weeks to go to a prototype rather than months or quarters." <br>
[53:10] "Conceptually, you're struggling walking towards that place because that's the place you want to be. If that's your problem, that's good. That's the promised land." <br>
[54:45] "Using our own tools is paramount because we are customers as well. So we see and feel the pain which helps us identify the problems and understand them."</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Community 1 Year Anniversary! // Demetrios Brinkmann, David Aponte & Vishnu Rachakonda // MLOps Meetup #59]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #59! Last Wednesday was the celebration of the MLOps Community 1 Year Anniversary! This has been a conversion of Demetrios Brinkmann, David Aponte and Vishnu Rachkonda!<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
Over the past year Demetrios, David and Vishnu have interviewed many of the top names in MLOps. During this time they have been able to apply these learnings at their jobs and see what works for them. In this one year anniversary meetup the three of them will discuss some of the most impacting advice they have received in the last year and how they have put it into practice.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Demetrios Brinkmann<br>
At the moment Demetrios is immersing himself in Machine Learning by interviewing experts from around the world in the weekly MLOps.community meetups. Demetrios is constantly learning and engaging in new activities to get uncomfortable and learn from his mistakes. He tries to bring creativity into every aspect of his life, whether that be analyzing the best paths forward, overcoming obstacles, or building lego houses with his daughter.<br>
<br>
David Aponte<br>
David is one of the organizers of the MLOps Community. He is an engineer, teacher, and lifelong student. He loves to build solutions to tough problems and share his learnings with others. He works out of NYC and loves to hike and box for fun. He enjoys meeting new people so feel free to reach out to him!<br>
<br>
Vishnu Rachakonda<br>
Vishnu is the operations lead for the MLOps Community and co-hosts the MLOps Coffee Sessions podcast. He is a machine learning engineer at Tesseract Health, a 4Catalyzer company focused on retinal imaging. In this role, he builds machine learning models for clinical workflow augmentation and diagnostics in on-device and cloud use cases. Since studying bioengineering at Penn, Vishnu has been actively working in the fields of computational biomedicine and MLOps. In his spare time, Vishnu enjoys suspending all logic to watch Indian action movies, playing chess, and writing.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #33 with Sarah Catanzaro of Amplify Partners, MLOps Investments.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Sarah Catanzaro is a Partner at Amplify Partners, where she focuses on investing in and advising high potential startups in machine intelligence, data management, and distributed systems. Her investments at Amplify include startups like RunwayML, Maze Design, OctoML, and Metaphor Data among others. Sarah also has several years of experience defining data strategy and leading data science teams at startups and in the defense/intelligence sector including through roles at Mattermark, Palantir, Cyveillance, and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies.<br>
<br>
//We had a wide-ranging discussion with Sarah,&nbsp;three takeaways&nbsp;stood out:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The relationship between unstructured data and structured data is due for change. In most settings, you have some form of structured data (i.e. a metadata table) and unstructured data (i.e. images, text, etc.) Managing the relationship between these forms of data can constitute the bulk of MLOps. Because of this difficulty, Sarah forecasted new tooling arising to make data management easier.</li>
 <li>Academic benchmarks suffer from a lack of transparency on production/industry use cases.&nbsp;In conversation with Andrew Ng, Sarah shared her lesson that despite all the blame industry professionals place on academics for narrowly optimizing to benchmarks with little practical meaning, they also share the blame for making it difficult to create meaningful benchmarks. Companies are loath to share realistic data and the true context in which ML has to operate.</li>
  <li>MLOps is due for consolidation, especially as companies adopt platform-driven strategies. As many of you all know, there are tons and tons of MLOps tools out there. As more companies address these challenges, Sarah predicted that many of the point solutions would start to be consolidated into larger platforms.</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Model Watching: Keeping Your Project in Production // Ben Wilson // MLOps Meetup #58]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #58! Last Wednesday we talked to Ben Wilson, Practice Lead Resident Solutions Architect, Databricks.<br>
Model Monitoring Deep Dive with the author of Machine Learning Engineering in Action. It was a pleasure getting to talk to Ben about difficulties in monitoring in machine learning. His expertise obviously comes from experience and as he said a few times in the meetup, I learned the hard way over 10 years as a data scientist so you don't have to!</p>
<p>Ben was also kind enough to give us a 35% off promo code for his book! Use the link: http://mng.bz/n2P5<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
A great deal of time is spent building out the most effectively tuned model, production-hardened code, and elegant implementation for a business problem. Shipping our precious and clever gems to production is not the end of the solution lifecycle, though, and many-an-abandoned projects can attest to this. In this talk, we will discuss how to think about model attribution, monitoring of results, and how (and when) to report those results to the business to ensure a long-lived and healthy solution that actually solves the problem you set out to solve.</p>
<p>//Bio<br>
Ben Wilson has worked as a professional data scientist for more than ten years. He currently works as a resident solutions architect at Databricks, where he focuses on machine learning production architecture with companies ranging from 5-person startups to global Fortune 100. Ben is the creator and lead developer of the Databricks Labs AutoML project, a Scala-and Python-based toolkit that simplifies machine learning feature engineering, model tuning, and pipeline-enabled modelling. He's the author of Machine Learning Engineering in Action, a primer on building, maintaining, and extending production ML projects.</p>
<p>//Takeaways<br>
Understanding why attribution and performance monitoring is critical for long-term project success</p>
<p>Borrowing hypothesis testing, stratification for latent confounding variable minimization, and statistical significance estimation from other fields can help to explain the value of your project to a business</p>
<p>Unlike in street racing, drifting is not cool in ML, but it will happen. Being prepared to know when to intervene will help to keep your project running.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[A Missing Link in the ML Infrastructure Stack // Josh Tobin // MLOps Meetup #57]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #57! Last Wednesday we talked to Josh Tobin, Founder, Stealth-Stage Startup.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Machine learning is quickly becoming a product engineering discipline. Although several new categories of infrastructure and tools have emerged to help teams turn their models into production systems, doing so is still extremely challenging for most companies. In this talk, we survey the tooling landscape and point out several parts of the machine learning lifecycle that are still underserved. We propose a new category of tool that could help alleviate these challenges and connect the fragmented production ML tooling ecosystem. We conclude by discussing similarities and differences between our proposed system and those of a few top companies.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Josh Tobin is the founder and CEO of a stealth machine learning startup. Previously, Josh worked as a deep learning &amp; robotics researcher at OpenAI and as a management consultant at McKinsey. He is also the creator of Full Stack Deep Learning (fullstackdeeplearning.com), the first course focused on the emerging engineering discipline of production machine learning. Josh did his PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by Pieter Abbeel.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to D. Sculley<br>
[00:40] Biggest Papers were written by D for Machine Learning<br>
[02:08] What's changed since you wrote those papers?<br>
[02:56] "No 1, there is an MLOps community."<br>
[04:38] Old best practices<br>
[05:12] "The fact that there are jobs titled MLOps, this is different than it was 5 or 6 years ago."<br>
[06:30] Machine Learning Systems then and now<br>
[07:08] "There wasn't the level of general infrastructure that was looking to offer the large scale integrated solutions." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
[07:57] ML Test Score<br>
[11:09] "The Test Score was really written for situations where you don't care about one prediction. You care about millions or billions of predictions per day."<br>
[12:27] "In the end, it's not about the score. It's about the process of asking the questions making sure that each of the important questions that you're asking yourself, you have a good answer to." &nbsp;<br>
[13:04] What else is needed in the Test Score?<br>
[14:36] Stratified testing &nbsp;<br>
[17:05] Counterfactual testing<br>
[18:34] Boundaries<br>
[19:15] Dark ages<br>
[20:27] How do you try in Triage?<br>
[21:10] "Reliability is important. There are no small mistakes. If there are errors, they're going to get spotted and publicised. They're going to impact user's lives. The bar is really high and it's worth the effort to ensure strong reliability."<br>
[23:11] How do you build that interest stress test?<br>
[24:39] "I believe that stress test is going to look like a useful way to encode expert knowledge about domain areas."<br>
[25:37] How do I bring robustness?<br>
[26:47] "Because we don't know how to specify the behaviour in advance, testing the behaviour that we wanted to have is a fundamentally hard problem."<br>
[27:22] Underspecification Paper<br>
[30:58] "It's important to be evaluating models on this auto domain stress test and make sure that we understand the implications of what we're thinking about while we are in deployment land."<br>
[32:27] Principal challenges in productionizing Machine Learning<br>
[34:57] "As we expose our models to more specifics, this means there are more potential places our models might be exhibiting unexpected or undesirable behaviour."<br>
[42:37] Splintering of ML Engineering<br>
[46:00] Communities shaping the MLOps sphere<br>
[46:42] "It's much better to have one large community than three smaller communities because of those edufacts."<br>
[47:47] Concept of technical debt in machine learning.<br>
[49:28] "The good idea is to tend to make their way into the community if they are in a form that people can digest and share."</p

			<title><![CDATA[Operationalizing Machine Learning at a Large Financial Institution // Daniel Stahl // MLOps Meetup #56]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #56! Last Wednesday we talked to &nbsp;Daniel Stahl, Head of Data and Analytic Platforms, Regions Bank.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
The Data Science practice has evolved significantly at Regions, with a corresponding need to scale and operationalize machine learning models. Additionally, highly regulated industries such as finance require a heightened focus on reproducibility, documentation, and model controls. &nbsp;In this session with Daniel Stahl, we will discuss how the Regions team designed and scaled their data science platform using DevOps and MLOps practices. &nbsp;This has allowed Regions to meet the increased demand for machine learning while embedding controls throughout the model lifecycle. &nbsp;In the 2 years since the data science platform has been onboarded, 100% of data products have been successfully operationalized.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Daniel Stahl leads the ML platform team at Regions Bank and is responsible for tooling, data engineering, and process development to make operationalizing models easy, safe, and compliant for Data Scientists. &nbsp;<br>
Daniel has spent his career in financial services and has developed novel methods for computing tail risk in both credit risk and operational risk, resulting in peer-reviewed publications in the Journal of Credit Risk and the Journal of Operational Risk. Daniel has a Masters in Mathematical Finance from the University of North Carolina Charlotte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Daniel lives in Birmingham, Alabama with his wife and two daughters.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[How to Avoid Suffering in Mlops/Data Engineering Role // Igor Lushchyk // MLOps Meetup #55]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #55! Last Wednesday we talked to Igor Lushchyk, Data Engineer, Adyen. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Building Data Science and Machine Learning platforms at a scale-up. Having the main difficulty in finding correct processes and basically being a toddler who learns how to walk on a steep staircase. The transition from homegrown platform to open source solutions, supporting old solutions and maturing them with making data scientists happy. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Igor is a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience. With a background in bioinformatics, he even started PhD but didn't finish it.<br>
As a data engineer, Igor has been working for the last 6 or 7 years, or maybe more - because he was doing almost the same data engineering stuff but his position was named differently.<br>
Igor has been doing a lot of MLOps in 4-5 years now. He doesn't know what he was doing more then - Data Engineering or MLOps. And that’s how this topic came about. &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Product Management in Machine Learning // Laszlo Sragner // MLOps Meetup #54]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #54! Last Wednesday we talked to Laszlo Sragner, Founder, Hypergolic.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
How my experience in quant finance and software engineering influenced how we ran ML at a London Fintech Startup. How to solve business problems with incremental ML? What's the difference between academic and industrial ML?<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Laszlo worked as a quant researcher at multiple investment managers and as a DS at the world's largest mobile gaming company. As Head of Data Science at Arkera, he drove the company's data strategy delivering solutions to Tier 1 investment banks and hedge funds. He currently runs Hypergolic (hypergolic.co.uk) an ML Consulting company helping startups and enterprises bring the maximum out of their data and ML operations.<br>
<br>
// Takeaways<br>
Continuous evaluation and monitoring is indistinguishable in a well set up product team. Separation of concerns (SE, ML, DevOps, MLOps) is very important for smooth operation, low friction team coordination/communication is key.<br>
To be able to iterate business features into models you need a modelling framework that can express these which is usually a DL package.<br>
DS-es are well motivated to go more technical because they see the rewards of it. All well run (from DS perspective) startups in my experience do the same.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Laszlo Sranger<br>
[02:15] Laszlo's Background<br>
[09:18] Being a Quant, then influenced, what you were doing with the Investment Banks?<br>
[12:24] Do you think this can be applied in different use cases or specific to what you are doing?<br>
[14:41] Do you have any thoughts of a potentially highly opinionated person?<br>
[16:54] Product management in Machine Learning<br>
[24:59] You have to be at a large company or you have to have a large team? [26:38] What are your thoughts on MLOps products helping with product management for ML? Is it an overreach or scope creep?<br>
[32:00] In the messy world of startups due to the big cost of an MVP for NLP is RegEx which means to user feedbacks it's incorporated by tweaking RegEx?<br>
[33:04] Does the ensemble recent models more than older models? If so, what is the decay rate of weights for older models?<br>
[35:40] Since the iterative management model is generic enough for most ML projects, which component of it can be easily generalized and tools built for version control?<br>
[36:38] Topic Extraction: What type of model do you train for that task?<br>
[52:55] Thoughts on Notebooks<br>
[53:34] "I don't hate notebooks. Let's be clear about that. I put it this way, notebooks are whiteboards. You don't want your whiteboards to be your output because it's a sketch of your solution. You want the purest solution."</p>

			<title><![CDATA[How Explainable AI is Critical to Building Responsible AI // Krishna Gade MLOps // Meetup #53]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #53! Last Wednesday we talked to Krishna Gade, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Fiddler AI.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Training and deploying ML models have become relatively fast and cheap, but with the rise of ML use cases, more companies and practitioners face the challenge of building “Responsible AI.” One of the barriers they encounter is increasing transparency across the entire AI lifecycle to not only better understand predictions, but also to find problem drivers. In this session with Krishna Gade, we will discuss how to build AI responsibly, share examples from real-world scenarios and AI leaders across industries, and show how Explainable AI is becoming critical to building Responsible AI.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Krishna is the co-founder and CEO of Fiddler, an Explainable AI Monitoring company that helps address problems regarding bias, fairness and transparency in AI. Prior to founding Fiddler, Gade led the team that built Facebook’s explainability feature ‘Why am I seeing this?’. He’s an entrepreneur with a technical background with experience creating scalable platforms and expertise in converting data into intelligence. Having held senior engineering leadership roles at Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Microsoft, he’s seen the effects that bias has on AI and machine learning decision-making processes, and with Fiddler, his goal is to enable enterprises across the globe solve this problem.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;MLOps community meetup #53! Last Wednesday we talked to Krishna Gade, CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder, Fiddler AI.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Abstract:&lt;br&gt;
Training and deploying ML models have become relatively fast and cheap, but with the rise of ML use cases, more companies and practitioners face the challenge of building “Responsible AI.” One of the barriers they encounter is increasing transparency across the entire AI lifecycle to not only better understand predictions, but also to find problem drivers. In this session with Krishna Gade, we will discuss how to build AI responsibly, share examples from real-world scenarios and AI leaders across industries, and show how Explainable AI is becoming critical to building Responsible AI.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
// Bio:&lt;br&gt;
Krishna is the co-founder and CEO of Fiddler, an Explainable AI Monitoring company that helps address problems regarding bias, fairness and transparency in AI. Prior to founding Fiddler, Gade led the team that built Facebook’s explainability feature ‘Why am I seeing this?’. He’s an entrepreneur with a technical background with experience creating scalable platforms and expertise in converting data into intelligence. Having held senior engineering leadership roles at Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Microsoft, he’s seen the effects that bias has on AI and machine learning decision-making processes, and with Fiddler, his goal is to enable enterprises across the globe solve this problem.&lt;br&gt;

[00:00] Introduction to Engineering Labs Participants <br>
[00:34] What are the Engineering Labs? <br>
[01:05] Credits to Ivan Nardini who organized this episode! &nbsp;<br>
[04:24] John Savage Profile <br>
[05:13] Did you want to learn MLFlow before this? <br>
[05:50] Alexey Naiden Profile &nbsp;<br>
[07:26] Varuna Jayasiri Profile <br>
[08:28] Michel Vasconcelos Profile <br>
[10:07] Do something with Pytorch and MLFlow and then figure out the rest: What did the process look like for you all? &nbsp;What have you created?<br>
[13:39] What did the implementation look like? How you went about structuring and coding it?<br>
[17:03] Did you encounter problems along the way?<br>
[20:26] Can you give us a rough overview of what you designed and then where was the first problem you saw?<br>
[23:08] Was there a lot to catch up with or did you feel it was fine. Can you explain how it was?<br>
[24:12] Talk to us about this tool that you have that John was calling out. What was it called?<br>
[24:41] Is this homegrown? You built this?<br>
[24:51] Did you guys implement this when you went to the engineering labs? [26:03] Can you take us through the pipeline and then the serving and what the overall view of the diagram is?<br>
[37:26] For a pet project it works well, but when you wanna start adding a little bit more on top of it wasn't doing the trick?<br>
[38:13] So you see it coming in it's much less of an integral part, another lego building block that is part of the whole thing?<br>
[40:54] Did you all have trouble with Pytorch or MLFlow?<br>
[42:44] Along with that, what was the prompt you were encountering when you were trying to use Torchserve?<br>
[44:27] What are you thinking would have been better in that case?<br>
[49:05] Feedback on how Engineering Labs went <br>
[50:20] Michel: "Engineering Labs should go on. I would like to be a part of it in the next lab." <br>
[51:52] Varuna: "This gives me a tangible thing to look at at any point in time and learn from it." <br>
[53:00] John: "I feel I have an anchor into the world of MLOps from having done this lab." <br>
[55:52] Alexey: "We're at a checkpoint where there are ways we could take" <br>
[56:01] Terraform piece Michel wrote for reproducibility.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Agile AI Ethics: Balancing Short Term Value with Long Term Ethical Outcomes // Pamela Jasper // MLOps Meetup #51]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #51! Last Wednesday we talked to Pamela Jasper, AI Ethicist, Founder, Jasper Consulting Inc.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
One of the challenges to the widespread adoption of AI Ethics is not only its integration with MLOps, but the added processes to embed ethical principles will slow and impede Innovation. I will discuss ways in which DS and ML teams can adopt Agile practices for Responsible AI.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Pamela M. Jasper, PMP is a global financial services technology leader with over 30 years of experience developing front-office capital markets trading and quantitative risk management systems for investment banks and exchanges in NY, Tokyo, London, and Frankfurt.

[00:00] Introduction to Pamela Jasper<br>
[00:17] Pamela's Background<br>
[05:45] Agile IA/Agile Machine Learning, If they are the right fit for each other?<br>
[07:50] What is agile? Not necessarily in and of itself a hard-coded framework.<br>
[08:05] Agile itself based on May 2001 Manifesto is simply a set of values and principles and teams that make decisions around these values and principles.<br>
[10:17] Proposal of Pamela: Let's do Agile with the underlying Ethics that are involved in the ways that you're creating this machine learning. Is that correct?<br>
[10:28] "What I'm suggesting is that Ethics become baked into almost to the mindset of a machine learning engineer, data scientists and in the machine learning operational process for MLOps."<br>
[14:37] "Not all models are created equal"<br>
[15:59] How would be in an Agile way put into practice in your mind?<br>
[36:38] What are the things that would help bridge the gap between AI Ethics and the Agile?<br>
[41:01] It's not that you're trying to bring on the Agile framework to the different pieces of Ethics. It's that you're bringing that into the Agile framework?<br>
[41:21] "We're weaving Ethics into the bedrock of existing Machine Learning practices."<br>
[45:13] How can you really get a diverse team if you're not hiring someone who's there as a diverse person?<br>
[48:59] What would Epics look like if you're baking Ethics?<br>
[52:52] How do you apply Ethics to an ethically questionable domain like gambling?<br>
[54:42] "I think that we can create an AI app for gambling is legal that becomes legal in that construct."<br>
[56:23] Do you think it's possible/desirable to automate any of the ethical considerations in this way?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #29 with Jet Basrawi of Satalia, Culture and Architecture in MLOps.<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Jet started his career in technology as a game designer but became interested in programming. He found he loved it. It was endlessly challenging and deeply enjoyable "Flow" activity. It was also nice to be in demand and earn a living.<br>
<br>
In the last several years, Jet been passionate about DevOps as a key strategic practice. About a year ago, he came into the AI world and it is a great place to be for someone like him. The challenges of MLOps and all the things surrounding AI delivery is a great space to work in.<br>
<br>
At about the time Jet got into AI the MLops community began, and it was a great experience to come on the journey with Demetrios who was uncovering topics in parallel to him. It was uncanny that each week Demetrios would run a meetup that dealt with exactly the topics he has been trying to reason about.<br>
<br>
Jet is very interested in culture and architecture and looking forward to exploring this subject in conversation.<br>
<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Jet Basrawi<br>
[01:24] Jet's take on MLOps<br>
[02:00] "MLOps - the real Kung fu's in the future" Jet<br>
[02:35] Jet's different opinion on "Tooling is the biggest piece in MLOps". &nbsp;<br>
[04:23] MLOps is a way of life. It's a lifestyle. It's not just tooling.<br>
[04:38] Why do you have to move over to the cultural side and where feel things fail culturally when it comes to machine learning?<br>
[05:47] What you refer to as an orthodox perspective on DevOps and how that place out in your perspective on MLOps? &nbsp;<br>
[06:37] Why do you believe that the separate terminology is coming about and do you believe that this is ultimately harmful to organizations to have this confusion or do you think things should be simplified?<br>
[09:05] As soon as you go down and you're not looking at the big picture. You go down one level and they divert completely, is that your thought too?<br>
[12:30] How do you go about educating yourself and then figuring out how to articulate MLOps or constitutes in your organization?<br>
[16:16] How to do things differently? What are some of your preferred tactics? How to encourage culture change? &nbsp;<br>
[19:02] "Management is NOT Leadership"<br>
[20:13] Why are people stuck in their agile approach?<br>
[23:57] Someone's trying to pick something up for the 1st time and then put it into production, how dangerous that can be?<br>
[25:53] Accepting failure<br>
[29:11] What are some of your principles that helped you communicate to the developers?<br>
[35:33] "It has to dumb down."<br>
[37:43] Annotation [39:37] "Patterntastic"<br>
[41:24] "MLOps is a people problem."<br>
[43:50] Sprint are adequate for machine learning?<br>
[47:03] "Software development is a social activity"<br>
[48:03] "We are all juniors in this field."<br>

			<title><![CDATA[2 tools to get you 90% operational // Michael Del Balso - Willem Pienaar - David Aronchick // MLOps Meetup #50]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #50! Last Wednesday we talked to Michael Del Balso, Willem Pienaar and David Aronchick,<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
The MLOps tooling landscape is confusing. There’s a complicated patchwork of products and open-source software that each cover some subset of the infrastructure requirements to get ML to production. In this session - we’ll focus on the two most important platforms: model management platforms and feature stores. Model management platforms such as Kubeflow help you get models to production quickly and reliably. Feature stores help you easily build, use, and deploy features. Together, they cover requirements to get models and data to production - the two most important components of any ML project. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In this panel discussion, we’ll be joined by David Aronchick (Co-Founder of Kubeflow), Mike Del Balso (Co-Founder of Tecton) and Willem Pienaar (Creator of Feast). These experts will share their perspective on the challenges of Operational ML and how to build the ideal infrastructure stack for MLOps. They’ll talk about the importance of managing models and data with the same engineering efficiency and best practices that we’ve been applying to application code. They’ll discuss the role of Kubeflow, Feast and Tecton, and share their views on the future of MLOps tooling.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Michael Del Balso<br>
CEO &amp; Co-founder, Tecton &nbsp;<br>
Mike is the co-founder of Tecton, where he is focused on building next-generation data infrastructure for Operational ML. Before Tecton, Mike was the PM lead for the Uber Michelangelo ML platform. He was also a product manager at Google where he managed the core ML systems that power Google’s Search Ads business. Previous to that, he worked on Google Maps. He holds a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering summa cum laude from the University of Toronto.<br>
<br>
Willem Pienaar<br>
Co-creator, Feast &nbsp;<br>
Willem is currently a tech lead at Tecton where he leads the development of Feast, an open-source feature store for machine learning. Previously he led the ML platform team at Gojek, the Southeast Asian decacorn, which supports a wide variety of models and handles over 100 million orders every month. His main focus areas are building data and ML platforms, allowing organizations to scale machine learning and drive decision making. In a previous life, Willem founded and sold a networking startup.<br>
<br>
David Aronchick<br>
Program Manager, Azure Innovations &nbsp;<br>
David leads works in the Azure Innovation Office on Machine Learning. This means he spends most of my time helping humans to convince machines to be smarter. He is only moderately successful at this. &nbsp;<br>
Previously, he led product management for Kubernetes on behalf of Google, launched Google Kubernetes Engine, and co-founded the Kubeflow project. He has also worked at Microsoft, Amazon, and Chef and co-founded three startups. &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Machine Learning Design Patterns for MLOps // Valliappa Lakshmanan // MLOps Meetup #49]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #49! Last Wednesday we talked to Lak Lakshmanan, Data Analytics and AI Solutions, Google Cloud.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Design patterns are formalized best practices to solve common problems when designing a software system. As machine learning moves from being a research discipline to a software one, it is useful to catalogue tried-and-proven methods to help engineers tackle frequently occurring problems that crop up during the ML process. In this talk, I will cover five patterns (Workflow Pipelines, Transform, Multimodal Input, Feature Store, Cascade) that are useful in the context of adding flexibility, resilience and reproducibility to ML in production. For data scientists and ML engineers, these patterns provide a way to apply hard-won knowledge from hundreds of ML experts to your own projects.<br>
<br>
Anyone designing infrastructure for machine learning will have to be able to provide easy ways for the data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers to implement these, and other, design patterns.<br>

[00:00] Introduction to Charlie You<br>
[01:50] Charlie's background on Machine Learning and inspiration to create a podcast<br>
[06:20] What's your experience been so far as the machine learning engineer and trying to put models into production and trying to get things out that has business value?<br>
[07:08] "I started the podcast because as I started working, I had the tingling that machine learning engineering is harder than most people thought, and like way harder than I personally thought."<br>
[08:20] What's an example of that where you target someone in your podcast, you keep that learning and you want an extra meeting the next day and say "Hey, actually I'm starting one of the world's experts on this topics and this is what they said"? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
[10:06] In a world of tons of traditional software engineering assets and the process you put in place, how have they adopted what they're doing to the machine learning realm? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
[19:00] About your podcast, what are some 2-3 most consistent trends that you've been seeing?<br>
[21:08] Instead of splintering so much as machine learning monitoring infrastructure specialist, are you going to departmentalize it in the future?<br>
[27:22] Is there such a thing as an MLOps engineer right now?<br>
[28:50] "We haven't seen a very vocal, very opinionated project manager in machine learning yet." - Todd Underwood<br>
[30:18] "Similarly with tooling, we haven't seen the emergence of the tools that encode those best practices." Charlie<br>
[31:42] "The day that you don't have to be a subject matter expert in machine learning to feel confident and deploy machine learning products, is the day that you will see the real product leadership in machine learning." Vishnu<br>
[34:12] I'd love to hear your take on some more trends that you've been seeing (Security and Ethics)<br>
[34:41] "Data Privacy and Security is always at the top of any consideration for infrastructure." Charlie<br>
[35:44] That's driven by legal requirements? How do you solve this problem?<br>
[37:27] How do we make sure that if that blows up, you're not left with nothing? &nbsp;<br>
[42:28] In your conversations, have you seen people who goes with cloud provider?<br>
[43:25] Enterprises have much different incentives than startups do.<br>
[45:48] What are some used cases where companies are needing to service their entire needs?<br>
[45:48] What are some used cases where companies are needing to service their entire needs?<br>
[49:18] What are some takeaways that you had in terms of how you think about your career, what experiences you want to build as this MLOps based engineering is moving so fast? &nbsp;<br>
[56:08] "Your edge is never in the algorithm"</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Practical MLOps // Noah Gift // MLOps Coffee Sessions #27]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #27 with Noah Gift of Pragmatic AI Labs, Practical MLOps&nbsp;</p>
<p>// A “Gift” from Above</p>
<p>This week, Demetrios and Vishnu got to spend time with inimitable Noah Gift. Noah is a data science educator, who teaches at Duke, Northwestern, and many other universities, as well as a technical leader through his company Pragmatic AI Labs and past companies.</p>
<p>His bio alone would take up this section of the newsletter, so we invite you to check it out here, as well as the rest of his educational content. Read on for some of our takeaways.</p>
<p>// HOW is as important as WHAT</p>
<p>In our conversation, Noah eloquently pointed out the numerous challenges of bringing ML into production, and especially for making sure it's used positively. It’s not enough to train great models; it’s important to make sure they impact the world positively as their productionized. How models are used is as important as what the model is.</p>
<p>Noah specifically commented on externalities and how’s it incumbent on all MLOps practitioners to understand the externalities created by their models.</p>
<p>// Just get certified</p>
<p>As an educator, Noah has seen front and center how deficits in ML/DS education at the university level have led to the “cowboy” data scientist that doesn’t fit into an effective technical organizational structure. In his courses, Noah emphasizes getting started with off the shelf models and understanding how existing software systems are engineered before committing to building ML systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Noah suggested getting certifications as a useful way of upskilling for anyone looking to increase their knowledge base in MLOps, especially by cloud providers.</p>
<p>// Tech Stack Risk</p>
<p>Finally, as many of you do, we debated the relative merits of the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) with Noah. With his vast experience, Noah made a great point about how adopting extremely new tools can sometimes go wrong. In the past, Noah adopted Erlang as a language used in the development of a product. However, as the language never quite took off (in his experience), it became a struggle to hire the right talent to get things done.</p>
<p>Readers, as you go about designing and building the MLOps stack, does any part of the process sound like Noah’s experience with Erlang? Tools or frameworks where downstream adoption may end up fractured? We’d love to hear more!</p>
<p>Definitely check out Noah’s podcast with us for more awesome nuggets on MLOps. Thanks to Noah for taking the time!&nbsp;</p>

[00:00] Introduction to Noah Gift &nbsp;<br>
[03:28] How we can stay pragmatic when it comes to MLOps?<br>
[32:45] The worst excuse that you can give somebody is that "I just do this stuff that's hard, intellectually, but departed, makes it work. That's your job." &nbsp;<br>
[33:34] "In academics, we don't do vocational training, we just teach you theory." "In the Master's Degree, we don't do anything that gets you a job."<br>
[46:33] MLOps vs Cloud Provider <br>
[51:35] GO vs Erlang</p>

&lt;p&gt;In our conversation, Noah eloquently pointed out the numerous challenges of bringing ML into production, and especially for making sure it&apos;s used positively. It’s not enough to train great models; it’s important to make sure they impact the world positively as their productionized. How models are used is as important as what the model is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah specifically commented on externalities and how’s it incumbent on all MLOps practitioners to understand the externalities created by their models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Just get certified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an educator, Noah has seen front and center how deficits in ML/DS education at the university level have led to the “cowboy” data scientist that doesn’t fit into an effective technical organizational structure. In his courses, Noah emphasizes getting started with off the shelf models and understanding how existing software systems are engineered before committing to building ML systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Noah suggested getting certifications as a useful way of upskilling for anyone looking to increase their knowledge base in MLOps, especially by cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Tech Stack Risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as many of you do, we debated the relative merits of the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) with Noah. With his vast experience, Noah made a great point about how adopting extremely new tools can sometimes go wrong. In the past, Noah adopted Erlang as a language used in the development of a product. However, as the language never quite took off (in his experience), it became a struggle to hire the right talent to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers, as you go about designing and building the MLOps stack, does any part of the process sound like Noah’s experience with Erlang? Tools or frameworks where downstream adoption may end up fractured? We’d love to hear more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely check out Noah’s podcast with us for more awesome nuggets on MLOps. Thanks to Noah for taking the time!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

[03:28] How we can stay pragmatic when it comes to MLOps?&lt;br&gt;
[32:45] The worst excuse that you can give somebody is that &quot;I just do this stuff that&apos;s hard, intellectually, but departed, makes it work. That&apos;s your job.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[33:34] &quot;In academics, we don&apos;t do vocational training, we just teach you theory.&quot; &quot;In the Master&apos;s Degree, we don&apos;t do anything that gets you a job.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Serving ML Models at a High Scale with Low Latency // Manoj Agarwal // MLOps Meetup #48]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #48! Last Wednesday, we talked to Manoj &nbsp;Agarwal, Software Architect at Salesforce.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Serving machine learning models is a scalability challenge at many companies. Most applications require a small number of machine learning models (often &lt; 100) to serve predictions. On the other hand, cloud platforms that support model serving, though they support hundreds of thousands of models, provision separate hardware for different customers. Salesforce has a unique challenge that only very few companies deal with; Salesforce needs to run hundreds of thousands of models sharing the underlying infrastructure for multiple tenants for cost-effectiveness.<br>
<br>
// Takeaways:<br>
This talk explains Salesforce hosts hundreds of thousands of models on a multi-tenant infrastructure to support low-latency predictions.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Manoj Agarwal is a Software Architect in the Einstein Platform team at Salesforce. Salesforce Einstein was released back in 2016, integrated with all the major Salesforce clouds. Fast forward to today and Einstein is delivering 80+ billion predictions across Sales, Service, Marketing &amp; Commerce Clouds per day.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[When Machine Learning meets privacy - Episode 9]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>**Private data, Data Science friendly**</p>
<p>Data Scientists are always eager to get their hands on more data, in particular, if that data has any value that can be extracted. Nevertheless, in real-world situations, data does not exist in the abundance that we thought existed, in other situations, the data might exist, but not possible to share it with different entities due to privacy concerns, which makes the work of data scientists not only hard, but sometimes even impossible.</p>
<p>// Abstract:</p>
<p>In the last episode of this series, we've decided to bring not one, but two guests to tells us how Synthetic data can unlock the use of data for Data Science teams whenever privacy concerns are a reality. &nbsp;Jean-François Rajotte, Researcher and Resident data Scientist at the University of Columbia and Sumit Mukherjee, Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft's AI for Good, bring us into more detail their expertise not only, in Synthetic data generation, but in it's mind blowing combination with Federated Learning to take the healthcare sector into the next level of AI adoption.</p>

[49:34] "It's too possible for you to do something wrong. You have to specify that wrong thing. That makes it harder to do that wrong thing." Daniel<br>
[51:54] "It starts with changing the mindset. Making people getting the habit of what is the value here. Then you are producing features for consumers because tomorrow you could become a consumer. Write it in a way as you want to consume somebody's feature." Simar<br>
[56:51] "As part of that process, it should come with everyone's best practices to actually improve all features" Matias<br>

			<title><![CDATA[ProductizeML: Assisting Your Team to Better Build ML Products // Adrià Romero // MLOps Meetup #47]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #47! Last Wednesday, we talked to Adrià&nbsp;Romero, Founder and Instructor at ProductizeML.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
In this talk, we tackled: &nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Motivations and mission behind ProductizeML.<br>
- Common friction points and miscommunication between technical and management/product teams, and how to bridge these gaps. &nbsp;<br>
- How to define ML product roadmaps, (and more importantly, how to get it signed off by all your team).<br>
- Best practices when managing the end-to-end ML lifecycle.<br>
<br>
/ Takeaways:<br>
- Self-study guide that reviews the end-to-end ML lifecycle starting with some ML theory, data access and management, MLOps, and how to wrap up all these pieces in a viable but still lovable product. &nbsp;<br>
- Free and collaborative self-study guide built by professionals with experience on different stages from the ML lifecycle.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Adrià&nbsp;is an AI, ML, and product enthusiast with more than 4 years of professional experience on his mission to empower society with data and AI-driven solutions.<br>
<br>
Born and raised in the beautiful and sunny Barcelona, he began his journey in the AI field as an applied researcher at the Florida Atlantic University, where he published some of the first deep learning works in the healthcare sector. Attracted by the idea of deploying these ideas to the real world, he then joined Triage, a healthcare startup building healthcare solutions powered by AI, such a smartphone app able to detect over 500 skin diseases from a picture. During this time, he has given multiple talks at conferences, hospitals, and institutions such as Novartis and Google. Previously, he interned at Huawei, Schneider Electric, and Insight Center for Data Analytics.<br>
<br>
Early this year, he started crafting ProductizeML, An Instruction and Interactive Guide for Teams Building Machine Learning Products where he and a team of AI &amp; product specialists carefully prepare content to assist on the end-to-end ML lifecycle.<br>

[10:06] Who do you need and what should they be doing? &lt;br&gt;
[18:05] How are you solving problems at your company? &lt;br&gt;
[27:22] What are your thoughts around ML tooling? Why that hasn&apos;t happened yet and why it will change? &lt;br&gt;
[33:16] You can&apos;t actually figure out what&apos;s the main focus of ML tooling services. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[34:14] &quot;Start small and start simple to focus only on a small problem that you can bring more than the others.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
[37:14] How are you making the case for how standardization to occur in your initial MLOps? &lt;br&gt;
[38:08] &quot;If you&apos;re doing a mistake somewhere, do it everywhere because it will be very easy to find and replace it after that.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
[41:50] How do you model monitoring? &lt;br&gt;
[47:19] How would you recommend people to get started? &lt;br&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Real-time Feature Pipelines, A Personal History // Hendrik Brackmann // MLOps Meetup #46]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #46! Last Wednesday, we talked to Hendrik Brackmann, Director of Data Science and Analytics at Tide.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Tide is a U.K.-based FinTech startup with offices in London, Sofia, and Hyderabad. It is one of the first, and the largest business banking platform in the UK, with over 150,000 SME members. As of 2019, one of Tide’s main focuses is to be data-driven. This resulted in the forming of a Data Science and Analytics Team with Hendrik Brackmann at its head. Let's witness Hendrik's personal anecdotes in this episode!<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
After studying probability theory at the University of Oxford, Hendrik joined MarketFinance, an SME lender, in order to develop their risk models. Following multiple years of learning, he joined Finiata, a Polish and German lender in order to build out their data science function. Not only did he succeed in improving the risk metrics of the company he also learnt to manage a different department as interim Head of Marketing.<br>
<br>
Hendrik's job as Director of Data Science and Analytics at business bank Tide is to oversee data engineering, data science, insights and analytics and data governance functions of Tide.<br>

[00:00] Intro to Todd Underwood<br>
[02:04] Todd's background<br>
[08:54] What's kind of vision do you "paint"?<br>
[14:54] Playing a little bit "devil's advocate." Do you think that's even possible?<br>
[19:36] "Start serving to make sure of having the possibility to get it out." How do you feel about that?<br>
[23:56] What advise could you give to other people who wanted to bring in ML professionals into their companies to make ML useful for them? [29:53] Is it useful to use these new models? &nbsp;<br>
[32:25] Do you feel like there would be a point where there would be a standard procedure?<br>
[35:50] How machine learning breaks<br>

			<title><![CDATA[How To Move From Barely Doing BI to Doing AI // Joe Reis // MLOps Meetup #45]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #45! Last Wednesday, we talked to Joe Reis, CEO/Co-Founder of Ternary Data.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
The fact is that most companies are barely doing BI, let alone AI. Joe discussed ways for companies to build a solid data foundation so they can succeed with machine learning. This meetup covers the continuum from cloud data warehousing to MLOps.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Joe is a Data Engineer and Architect, Recovering Data Scientist, 20 years in the data game. &nbsp;Joe enjoys helping companies make sense of their culture, processes, and architecture so they can go from dreaming to doing. He’s certified in both AWS and Google Cloud. When not working, you can find Joe at one of the two groups he co-founded—The Utah Data Engineering Meetup and SLC Python. Joe also sits on the board of Utah Python, a non-profit dedicated to advocating Python in Utah.</p>

Timestamps:<br>
[00:23] How did you get into tech? What brought you on to the journey into data?<br>
[04:50] You got into the auto ML and you decided to branch out and do your own thing? How did that happen?<br>
[08:18] What is it with BI and then making that jump to ML?<br>
[11:00] How have you seen Machine Learning fall flat with trying to shoehorn Machine Learning on top of the already weak foundation of BI?<br>
[13:45] Let's imagine we're doing BI fairly well and now we want to jump to Machine Learning. Do we have to go out and reinvent the whole stack or can we shoehorn it on?<br>
[15:36] How do you move from BI to ML?<br>
[18:24] What do you mean by realtime? &nbsp;<br>
[20:35] Managed Services in DevOps<br>
[23:30] The maturity isn't there yet<br>
[26:03] Where would you draw the line between BI and AI?<br>
[30:45] What are the things is Machine Learning an overkill for?<br>
[33:43] Are you thinking about what data sets to collect and how different do those vary?<br>
[35:18] "Software Engineering and Data Engineering are basically going to merge into one."<br>
[38:27] What do you usually recommend moving from BI to AI?<br>
[40:45] What is "strong data foundation" in your eyes?<br>
[42:47] "MLFlow to gateway drug." What's your take on it? &nbsp;<br>
[46:25] In this pandemic, how easy is it for you to pivot to a new provider?<br>
[49:10] Vision of companies starts coming together on different parts of the stack in the Machine Learning tools.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>**Privacy-preserving ML with Differential Privacy**</strong></p>
<p>Differential privacy is without a question one of the most innovative concepts that came around in the last decades, with a variety of different applications even when it comes to Machine Learning. Many are organizations already leveraging this technology to access and make sense of their most sensitive data, but what is it? How does it work? And how can we leverage it the most?</p>
<p>To explain this and provide us a brief intro on Differential Privacy, I've invited <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christos-dimitrakakis-792258/">Christos Dimitrakakis.</a> Professor at University, counts already with multiple publications (more than 1000!!!) in the areas of Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Privacy.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Monzo Bank - An MLOps Case Study // Neal Lathia // MLOps Coffee Sessions #20]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #20 with Neal Lathia of Monzo Bank, talking about Monzo Bank - An MLOps Case Study<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Neal is currently the Machine Learning Lead at Monzo in London, where his team focuses on building machine learning systems that optimise the app and help the company scale. Neal's work has always focused on applications that use machine learning - this has taken him from recommender systems to urban computing and travel information systems, digital health monitoring, smartphone sensors, and banking.<br>
<br>
//Talk Takeaways<br>
Monzo Bank has a small, but a very impactful team continuously learning new things. Optimistically do their utmost to avoid “throwing problems over the wall,” and so they build systems, iterate on machine learning models, and collaborate very closely with each other and with many folks across the business.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, all of that paints a picture of a team that aims to bring real and valuable machine learning systems to life. Monzo does not spend time trying to advance the state-of-the-art in machine learning or tweak models to absolute perfection.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>**<strong>The intersection between DataOps and privacy**</strong></p>
<p>DataOps is considered by many as the new era of data management, a set of principles that emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, and automation of cooperation between the different teams in an organization that have to deal with data: data engineers, data scientists to data analysts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But is there any relation between DataOps and data privacy protection? Can organizations leverage DataOps to ensure that their data is privacy compliant?</p>
<p>For this episode we've invited Lars Albertsson founder of<a href="https://www.scling.com/"> Scling</a> and former Data Engineer at Spotify, Lars has been educating organizations on how to get value from data and engineering efficiency!<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Introducing Data Downtime: From Firefighting to Winning // Barr Moses // MLOps Coffee Sessions #19]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coffee Sessions #19 with Barr Moses of Monte Carlo, Introducing Data Downtime: How to Prevent Broken Data Pipelines with Observability co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Barr Moses is CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Monte Carlo, a data observability company backed by Accel and other top Silicon Valley investors. Previously, she was VP Customer Operations at customer success company Gainsight, where she helped scale the company 10x in revenue and among other functions, built the data/analytics team. Prior to that, she was a management consultant at Bain &amp; Company and a research assistant at the Statistics Department at Stanford. She also served in the Israeli Air Force as a commander of an intelligence data analyst unit. Barr graduated from Stanford with a B.Sc. in Mathematical and Computational Science.<br>
<br>
//Talk Takeaways<br>
As companies become increasingly data-driven, the technologies underlying these rich insights have grown more and more nuanced and complex. While our ability to collect, store, aggregate, and visualize this data has largely kept up with the needs of modern data teams (think:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up/" target="_blank">domain-oriented data meshes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-migrate-to-snowflake-like-a-boss/" target="_blank">cloud warehouses</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">data visualization tools</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling" target="_blank">data modelling solutions</a>), the mechanics behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-fix-your-data-quality-problem/" target="_blank">data quality</a>&nbsp;and integrity has lagged.</p>
<p><em>To keep pace with data’s clock speed of innovation, data engineers need to invest not only in the latest modelling and analytics tools but also technologies that can increase data accuracy and prevent broken pipelines. The solution?&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/what-is-data-observability/" target="_blank"><em>Data observability</em></a><em>, the next frontier of data engineering and a pillar of the emerging&nbsp;Data Reliability category and the fix for eliminating data downtime.</em></p>
<p>During this talk, listeners will learn about:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The rise (and threat) of data downtime</li>
 <li>The relationship between DevOps Observability and Data Observability</li>
  <li>Data Observability and it's five key pillars</li>
  <li>How the best data teams are leveraging Data Observability to prevent broken pipelines</li>
</ul>
<p>//About Monte Carlo As businesses increasingly rely on data to drive better decision making, it’s mission-critical that this data is accurate and reliable. Billed by Forbes as the New Relic for data teams and backed by Accel and GGV, Monte Carlo solves the costly problem of broken data through their fully automated, end-to-end data reliability platform. Data teams spend north of 30% of their time tackling data quality issues, distracting data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts from working on revenue-generating projects. Providing full coverage of your data stack – all the way from data lake and warehouse to analytics dashboard – Monte Carlo’s platform empowers companies such as Eventbrite, Compass, Vimeo, and other enterprises to trust their data, saving time and money and unlocking the potential of data.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Coffee Sessions #19 with Barr Moses of Monte Carlo, Introducing Data Downtime: How to Prevent Broken Data Pipelines with Observability co-hosted by Vishnu Rachakonda&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Bio&lt;br&gt;
Barr Moses is CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder of Monte Carlo, a data observability company backed by Accel and other top Silicon Valley investors. Previously, she was VP Customer Operations at customer success company Gainsight, where she helped scale the company 10x in revenue and among other functions, built the data/analytics team. Prior to that, she was a management consultant at Bain &amp;amp; Company and a research assistant at the Statistics Department at Stanford. She also served in the Israeli Air Force as a commander of an intelligence data analyst unit. Barr graduated from Stanford with a B.Sc. in Mathematical and Computational Science.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//Talk Takeaways&lt;br&gt;
As companies become increasingly data-driven, the technologies underlying these rich insights have grown more and more nuanced and complex. While our ability to collect, store, aggregate, and visualize this data has largely kept up with the needs of modern data teams (think:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montecarlodata.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;domain-oriented data meshes&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-migrate-to-snowflake-like-a-boss/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cloud warehouses&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data visualization tools&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data modelling solutions&lt;/a&gt;), the mechanics behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-fix-your-data-quality-problem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data quality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and integrity has lagged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To keep pace with data’s clock speed of innovation, data engineers need to invest not only in the latest modelling and analytics tools but also technologies that can increase data accuracy and prevent broken pipelines. The solution?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montecarlodata.com/what-is-data-observability/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data observability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the next frontier of data engineering and a pillar of the emerging&amp;nbsp;Data Reliability category and the fix for eliminating data downtime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, listeners will learn about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The rise (and threat) of data downtime&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The relationship between DevOps Observability and Data Observability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Observability and it&apos;s five key pillars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the best data teams are leveraging Data Observability to prevent broken pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//About Monte Carlo As businesses increasingly rely on data to drive better decision making, it’s mission-critical that this data is accurate and reliable. Billed by Forbes as the New Relic for data teams and backed by Accel and GGV, Monte Carlo solves the costly problem of broken data through their fully automated, end-to-end data reliability platform. Data teams spend north of 30% of their time tackling data quality issues, distracting data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts from working on revenue-generating projects. Providing full coverage of your data stack – all the way from data lake and warehouse to analytics dashboard – Monte Carlo’s platform empowers companies such as Eventbrite, Compass, Vimeo, and other enterprises to trust their data, saving time and money and unlocking the potential of data.&lt;/p&gt;

In this session, we explored the MLOps landscape through the eyes of two accomplished investors. Tim And Nathan shared with us their experience in looking at hundreds of ML and MLOps companies each year to highlight major insights they have gained. What do the ML infrastructure and tooling landscape look like at the moment? Where have they been seeing patterns emerge? What do they expect to see happen within the market in the next couple of years? What current tools out there are the most interesting to them? And last but not least how do they go about selecting which companies to invest in.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[When Machine Learning meets privacy - Episode 3 with Charles Radclyffe]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>**AI and ethical dilemmas** <br>
<br>
Artificial Intelligence is seen by many as a vehicle for great transformation, but for others, it still remains a mystery, and many questions remain unanswered: will AI systems rule us one day? Can we trust AI to rule our criminal systems? Maybe create political campaigns and dominate political advertisements? Or maybe something less harmful, do our laundry? Some of these questions may sound absurd, but they are for sure making people shift from thinking purely about functional AI capabilities but also to look further to the ethics behind creating such powerful solutions. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
For this episode we count with Charles Radclyffe as a guest, the data philosopher, to cover some of these dilemmas. You can reach out to Charles through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radclyffe/">LinkedIn</a> or at ethicsgrade.io &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[When Machine Learning meets Data Privacy - Episode 2 with Cat Coode]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are regulations saying about data privacy?</strong></p>
<p>We are already aware of the importance of using Machine Learning to improve businesses, nevertheless to feed Machine Learning, data is a must, and in many cases, this data might even be considered sensitive information. So, does this mean that with new privacy regulations, access to data will be more and more difficult? ML and Data Science have their days counted? Or Will Machine beat privacy?<br>
<br>
To answer all these questions I’ve invited Cat Coode, an expert on Data Privacy regulations, to join me in this episode, and help us sort out these questions!</p>
<p>Don’t forget to subscribe to the <a href="https://go.mlops.community/slack">Mlops.community slack</a> and if you’re looking for privacy-preserving solutions, show us some love and give a star to the Synthetic data open-source repo (https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic)</p>

			<title><![CDATA[When You Say Data Scientist Do You Mean Data Engineer? Lessons Learned From Start Up Life // Elizabeth Chabot]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we talked to Elizabeth Chabot, Consultant at Deloitte, about When You Say Data Scientist Do You Mean Data Engineer? Lessons Learned From StartUp Life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>// Key takeaways: <br>
If you have a data product that you want to function in production, you need MLOps Education needs to happen about the data product life cycle, noting that ML is just part of the equation Titles need to be defined to help outside users understand the differences in roles &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract: <br>
ML and AI may sound sexy to investors, but if you work in the field you've probably spent late nights reviewing outputs manually, poured over logs and ran root cause analyses until your eyes hurt. If you've created data products at a company where analytics and data science held no meaning before your arrival, you've probably spent many-a-late-night explaining the basics of data collection, why ETL cannot be half-baked and that when you create a supervised model it needs to be supervised. Companies hoping to create a data product can have a data scientist show them how ML/AI can further their product, help them scale, or create better recommendations than their competitors. What companies are not always aware of is once the algorithm is created the data scientist is usually handicapped until more data-hires are made to build the necessary pipelines and frontend to put the algorithm in production. With the number of unique data-titles growing each year, how should the first data-evangelist-wrangler-wizard navigate title assignment? &nbsp;<br>

// Bio: Elizabeth is a researcher turned data nerd. With a background in social and clinical sciences, Elizabeth is focused on developing data solutions that focus on creating value adds while allowing the user to make more intelligent decisions. <br>

			<title><![CDATA[Metaflow: Supercharging Our Data Scientist Productivity // Ravi Kiran Chirravuri // MLOps Meetup #41]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #41! Last Wednesday was an exciting episode that some attendees couldn't help to ask when is the next season of their favorite series! The conversation was around Metaflow: Supercharging Data Scientist Productivity with none other than Netflix’s very own Ravi Kiran Chirravuri.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Netflix's unique culture affords its data scientists an extraordinary amount of freedom. They are expected to build, deploy, and operate large machine learning workflows autonomously without the need to be significantly experienced with systems or data engineering. Metaflow, our ML framework (now open-source at metaflow.org), provides them with delightful abstractions to manage their project's lifecycle end-to-end, leveraging the strengths of the cloud: elastic compute and high-throughput storage. In this talk, we preface with our experience working alongside data scientists, present our human-centric design principles when building Machine Learning Infrastructure, and showcase how you can adopt these yourself with ease with open-source Metaflow.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Ravi is an individual contributor to the Machine Learning Infrastructure (MLI) team at Netflix. With almost a decade of industry experience, he has been building large-scale systems focusing on performance, simplified user journeys, and intuitive APIs in MLI and previously Search Indexing and Tensorflow at Google.<br>

<p>Luigi Patruno: a man whose goal is to help data scientists, ML engineers, and AI product managers, build and operate machine learning systems in production.</p>
<p>Luigi shares with us why he started ML in Production - A lot irrelevant content; a lot of clickbait with low standards of quality.</p>
<p>He had an Entrepreneurial itch and The solution was to start a weekly newsletter. From there he started creating Blog posts and now teamed up with Sam Charrington of TWIML to create courses on SagMaker ML.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applied ML</p>
<p>Best practices</p>
<p>Reading google and microsoft papers</p>

<p>Tag, version</p>
<p>Store your training, val, and test sets!</p>
<p><br></p>

			<title><![CDATA[When Machine Learning meets Data Privacy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the first episode of a podcast series on Machine Learning and Data privacy. &nbsp;Machine Learning is the key to the new revolution in many industries. Nevertheless, ML does not exist without data and a lot of it, which in many cases results in the use of sensitive information. With new privacy regulations, access to data is today harder and much more difficult but, does that mean that ML and Data Science has its days counted? Will the Machines beat privacy? &nbsp;<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps level 2: CI/CD pipeline automation<br>
For a rapid and reliable update of the pipelines in production, you need a robust automated CI/CD system. This automated CI/CD system lets your data scientists rapidly explore new ideas around feature engineering, model architecture, and hyperparameters. They can implement these ideas and automatically build, test, and deploy the new pipeline components to the target environment.<br>
<br>
Figure 4. CI/CD and automated ML pipeline. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
This MLOps setup includes the following components: &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Source control<br>
Test and build services<br>
Deployment services<br>
Model registry<br>
Feature store<br>
ML metadata store<br>
ML pipeline orchestrator<br>
<br>
Characteristics of stages discussion. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Figure 5. Stages of the CI/CD automated ML pipeline. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The pipeline consists of the following stages:<br>
<br>
Development and experimentation: You iteratively try out new ML algorithms and new modelling where the experiment steps are orchestrated. The output of this stage is the source code of the ML pipeline steps that are then pushed to a source repository. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Pipeline continuous integration: You build source code and run various tests. The outputs of this stage are pipeline components (packages, executables, and artefacts) to be deployed in a later stage. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Pipeline continuous delivery: You deploy the artefacts produced by the CI stage to the target environment. The output of this stage is a deployed pipeline with the new implementation of the model. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Automated triggering: The pipeline is automatically executed in production based on a schedule or in response to a trigger. The output of this stage is a trained model that is pushed to the model registry. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Model continuous delivery: You serve the trained model as a prediction service for the predictions. The output of this stage is a deployed model prediction service. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Monitoring: You collect statistics on the model performance based on live data. The output of this stage is a trigger to execute the pipeline or to execute a new experiment cycle. &nbsp;The data analysis step is still a manual process for data scientists before the pipeline starts a new iteration of the experiment. The model analysis step is also a manual process.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Hands-on serving models using KFserving // Theofilos Papapanagiotou // Data Science Architect at Prosus // MLOps Meetup #40]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #40! Last Wednesday, we talked to Theofilos Papapanagiotou, Data Science Architect at Prosus, about Hands-on Serving Models Using KFserving.<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
We looked to some popular model formats like the SavedModel of Tensorflow, the Model Archiver of PyTorch, pickle&amp;ONNX, to understand how the weights of the NN are saved there, the graph, and the signature concepts.<br>
<br>
We discussed the relevant resources of the deployment stack of Istio (the Ingress gateway, the sidecar and the virtual service) and Knative (the service and revisions), as well as Kubeflow and KFServing. Then we got into the design details of KFServing, its custom resources, the controller and webhooks, the logging, and configuration.<br>
<br>
We spent a large part in the monitoring stack, the metrics of the servable (memory footprint, latency, number of requests), as well as the model metrics like the graph, init/restore latencies, the optimizations, and the runtime metrics which end up to Prometheus. We looked at the inference payload and prediction logging to observe drifts and trigger the retraining of the pipeline.<br>
<br>
Finally, a few words about the awesome community and the roadmap of the project on multi-model serving and inference routing graph.<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
Theo is a recovering Unix Engineer with 20 years of work experience in Telcos, on internet services, video delivery, and cybersecurity. He is also a university student for life; BSc in CS 1999, MSc in Data Coms 2008, and MSc in AI 2017.<br>
<br>
Nowadays he calls himself an ML Engineer, as he expresses through this role his passion for System Engineering and Machine Learning.<br>
<br>
His analytical thinking is driven by curiosity and hacker spirit. He has skills that span a variety of different areas: Statistics, Programming, Databases, Distributed Systems, and Visualization.<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #39! Last week we talked to Ivan Nardini, Customer Engineer at SAS, about Operationalize Open Source Models with SAS Open Model Manager. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Abstract:<br>
Analytics are Open. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
According to their nature, Open Source technologies allows an agile development of the models, but it results difficult to put them in production. &nbsp;The goal of SAS is supporting customers in operationalize analytics &nbsp;In this meetup,<br>
<br>
I present SAS Open Model Manager, a containerized Modelops tool that accelerates deployment processes and, once in production, allows monitoring your models (SAS and Open Source). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
// Bio:<br>
As a member of Pre-Sales CI &amp; Analytics Support Team, I'm specialized in ModelOps and Decisioning. I've been involved in operationalizing analytics using different Open Source technologies in a variety of industries. My focus is on providing solutions to deploy, monitor and govern models in production and optimize business decisions processes. To reach this goal, I work with software technologies (SAS Viya platform, Container, CI/CD tools) and Cloud (AWS). &nbsp;<br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>//Bio<br>
Satish built compilers, profilers, IDEs, and other dev tools for over a decade. At Microsoft Research, he saw his colleagues solving hard program analysis problems using Machine Learning. That is when he got curious and started learning. His approach to ML is influenced by his software engineering background of building things for production. &nbsp;&nbsp;He has a keen interest in doing ML in production, which is a lot more than training and tuning the models. The first step is to understand the product and business context, then building an efficient pipeline, then training models, and finally monitoring its efficacy and impact on the business. &nbsp;He considers ML as another tool in the software engineering toolbox, albeit a very powerful one. &nbsp;He is a co-founder of Slang Labs, a Voice Assistant as a Service platform for building in-app voice assistants. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
//Talk Takeaways ML-driven product features will grow manifold. Organizations take an evolutionary approach to absorb tech innovations. ML will be no exception. How Organizations adopted cloud can offer useful lessons.<br>
ML/DS folks who invest in an understanding business context and tech environment of the org will make a bigger impact.<br>
Organizations that invest in data infrastructure will be more successful in extracting value from machine learning. &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Scalable Python for Everyone, Everywhere // Matthew Rocklin // MLOps Meetup #38]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Parallel Computing with Dask and Coiled</strong></p>
<p>Python makes data science and machine learning accessible to millions of people around the world. However, historically Python hasn't handled parallel computing well, which leads to issues as researchers try to tackle problems on increasingly large datasets. &nbsp;Dask is an open source Python library that enables the existing Python data science stack (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter, ...) with parallel and distributed computing. Today Dask has been broadly adopted by most major Python libraries, and is maintained by a robust open source community across the world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This talk discusses parallel computing generally, Dask's approach to parallelizing an existing ecosystem of software, and some of the challenges we've seen in deploying distributed systems.</p>
<p>Finally, we also addressed the challenges of robustly deploying distributed systems, which ends up being one of the main accessibility challenges for users today. We hope that by the end of the meetup attendees will better understand parallel computing, have built intuition around how Dask works, and have the opportunity to play with their own Dask cluster on the cloud.</p>
<p>Matthew is an open source software developer in the numeric Python ecosystem. He maintains several PyData libraries, but today focuses mostly on Dask a library for scalable computing. Matthew worked for Anaconda Inc for several years, then built out the Dask team at NVIDIA for RAPIDS, and most recently founded Coiled Computing to improve Python's scalability with Dask for large organizations.</p>
<p>Matthew has given talks at a variety of technical, academic, and industry conferences. &nbsp;A list of talks and keynotes is available at (https://matthewrocklin.com/talks).</p>
<p>Matthew holds a bachelor’s degree from UC Berkeley in physics and mathematics, and a PhD in computer science from the University of Chicago.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Coffee Sessions #13 How to Choose the Right Machine Learning Tool: A Conversation // Jose Navarro and Mariya Davydova]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This time we talked about one of the most vibrant questions for any MLOps practitioner: how to choose the right tools for your ML team, given the huge amount of open-source and proprietary MLOps tools available on the market today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed several criteria to rely on when choosing a tool, including:</p>
<p>- The requirements of the particular team use-cases<br>
- The scaling capacity of the tool<br>
- The cost of migration from a chosen tool<br>
- The cost of teaching the team to use this tool<br>
- The company or the community behind the tool</p>
<p>Apart from that, we talked about particular use-cases and discussed the trade-offs between waiting for a new release of your tool to get the missing piece of functionality, switching to another tool, and building an in-house solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also touched the topic of organising MLOps teams and practices across large companies with a lot of ML teams.<br>
<br>
// Bio: <br>
Jose Navarro <br>
Jose Navarro is a Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer making everyday cooking fun at Cookpad, where its recipe platform has more than 40 million monthly users. He holds a MSc in Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing from the University of Bristol. He is interested in Cloud Native technologies, serverless, and event-driven architecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mariya Davidova <br>
Mariya came to MLOps from a software development background. She started her career as a Java developer in JetBrains in 2011, then gradually moved to developer advocacy for JS-based APIs. In 2019, she joined Neu.ro as a platform developer advocate and then moved to the product management position. &nbsp;<br>
Mariya has been obsessed with AI and ML for many years: she finished a bunch of courses, read a lot of books, and even wrote a couple of fiction stories about AI. She believes that proper tooling and decent development and operations practices are essential success component for ML projects, as well as they are for traditional SD.<br>

Mariya came to MLOps from a software development background. She started her career as a Java developer in JetBrains in 2011, then gradually moved to developer advocacy for JS-based APIs. In 2019, she joined Neu.ro as a platform developer advocate and then moved to the product management position. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
Mariya has been obsessed with AI and ML for many years: she finished a bunch of courses, read a lot of books, and even wrote a couple of fiction stories about AI. She believes that proper tooling and decent development and operations practices are essential success component for ML projects, as well as they are for traditional SD.&lt;br&gt;

What is it?<br>
Parallelism for analytics<br>
What is parallelism?<br>
Doing a lot at once by splitting tasks into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel (at the same time)<br>
Distributed work across multiple machines and then combining the results<br>
Helpful for CPU bound - doing a bunch of calculations on the CPU. The rate at which process progresses is limited by the speed of the CPU<br>
Concurrency?<br>
Similar but a but things don’t have to happen at the same time, they can happen asynchronously. They can overlap.<br>
Shared state<br>
Helpful to I/O bound - networking, reading from disk, etc. The rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the I/O subsystem.<br>
Multi-core vs distributed<br>
Multi-core is a single processor with 2 or more cores that can cooperate through threads - multithreading<br>
Distributed is across multiple nodes communicating via HTTP or RPC Why is this hard?<br>
Python has it challenges due to GIL, other languages don't have this problem<br>
Shared state can lead to potential race conditions, deadlocks, etc<br>
Coordination work across the machines<br>
For analytics?<br>
Calculating some statistics on a large dataset can be tricky if it can’t fit in memory</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Coffee Sessions #12: Journey of Flyte at Lyft and Through Open-source // Ketan Umare]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Why was Flyte built at Lyft?</p>
<p>What sorts of requirements does a ML infrastructure team have at lyft?</p>
<p>What problems does it solve / use cases?</p>
<p>Where does it fit in in the ML and Data ecosystem?</p>
<p>What is the vision?</p>
<p>Who should consider using it?</p>
<p>Learnings as the engineering team tried to bootstrap an open-source community.</p>
<p>Ketan Umare is a senior staff software engineer at Lyft responsible for technical direction of the Machine Learning Platform and is a founder of the Flyte project. Before Flyte he worked on ETA, routing and mapping infrastructure at Lyft. He is also the founder of Flink Kubernetes operator and contributor to Spark on kubernetes. Prior to Lyft he was a founding member of Oracle Baremetal Cloud and lead teams building Elastic Block Storage. Prior to that, he started and lead multiple teams in Mapping and Transportation optimization infrastructure at Amazon. He received his Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Tech specializing in High-performance computing and his Bachelors in Engineering in Computer Science from VJTI Mumbai.</p>
<p>Besides work, he enjoys spending time with his daughter and wife. He loves the Pacific Northwest outdoors and will try anything new.</p>
<p>Lyft</p>
<p>Pricing, Locations, Estimated Time of Arrivals (ETA), Mapping, Self-Driving (L5), etc.</p>
<p>What sort of scale, storage, network bandwidth are we looking at?</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of workflows, hundreds of thousands of executions, millions of tasks, and tens of millions of containers!</p>
<p>Flyte: more than 900k workflow executed a month and more than 30+ million container executions per month</p>
<p>Typical flow of information?</p>
<p>What are the user stories you’re typically dealing with at lyft?</p>
<p>How do you set it up?</p>
<p>On-prem, cloud, etc.</p>
<p>Helm installable?</p>
<p>Why Golang?</p>
<p>What problems does it solve?</p>
<p>Complex data dependencies? Why</p>
<p>Orchestrated compute on demand</p>
<p>Reuse and sharing</p>
<p>Key features</p>
<p>Multi-tenant, hosted, serverless</p>
<p>Parametrized, data lineage, caching</p>
<p>Additionally, if the run invokes a task that has already been computed before, regardless of who executed it, Flyte will smartly use the cached output, saving you both time and money.</p>
<p>Versioning, sharing</p>
<p>Modular, loosely coupled</p>
<p>Seems like you guys recognize that the best task for the job might be hosted elsewhere, so it was important to integrate other solutions into flyte.</p>
<p>Flyte extensions</p>
<p>Backend plugins - is it true you can create and manage k8s resources like CRDs for things like spark, sagemaker, bigquery?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Round 3 analyzing the Google paper "Continuous Delivery and Automation Pipelines in ML"</p>
<p>// Show Notes</p>
<p>Data Science Steps for ML</p>
<p>Data extraction: You select and integrate the relevant data from various data sources for the ML task.</p>
<p>Data analysis: You perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the available data for building the ML model. This process leads to the following:</p>
<p>Understanding the data schema and characteristics that are expected by the model.</p>
<p>Identifying the data preparation and feature engineering that are needed for the model.</p>
<p>Data preparation: The data is prepared for the ML task. This preparation involves data cleaning, where you split the data into training, validation, and test sets. You also apply data transformations and feature engineering to the model that solves the target task. The output of this steps are the data splits in the prepared format.</p>
<p>Model training: The data scientist implements different algorithms with the prepared data to train various ML models. In addition, you subject the implemented algorithms to hyperparameter tuning to get the best performing ML model. The output of this step is a trained model.</p>
<p>Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on a holdout test set to evaluate the model quality. The output of this step is a set of metrics to assess the quality of the model.</p>
<p>Model validation: The model is confirmed to be adequate for deployment—that its predictive performance is better than a certain baseline.</p>
<p>Model serving: The validated model is deployed to a target environment to serve predictions. This deployment can be one of the following:</p>
<p>Microservices with a REST API to serve online predictions.</p>
<p>An embedded model to an edge or mobile device.</p>
<p>Part of a batch prediction system.</p>
<p>Model monitoring: The model predictive performance is monitored to potentially invoke a new iteration in the ML process.</p>
<p>The level of automation of these steps defines the maturity of the ML process, which reflects the velocity of training new models given new data or training new models given new implementations. The following sections describe three levels of MLOps, starting from the most common level, which involves no automation, up to automating both ML and CI/CD pipelines.<br>
<br>
In the rest of the conversation, we talk about maturity levels 0 and 1. Next session we will talk about Level 2.</p>

&lt;p&gt;The level of automation of these steps defines the maturity of the ML process, which reflects the velocity of training new models given new data or training new models given new implementations. The following sections describe three levels of MLOps, starting from the most common level, which involves no automation, up to automating both ML and CI/CD pipelines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the rest of the conversation, we talk about maturity levels 0 and 1. Next session we will talk about Level 2.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #36: Moving Deep Learning from Research to Prod Using DeterminedAI and Kubeflow // David Hershey, DeterminedAI]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #36! This week we talk to David Hershey Solutions Engineer at Determined AI, about Moving Deep Learning from Research to Production with Determined and Kubeflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>// Key takeaways:</p>
<p>What components are needed to do inference in ML</p>
<p>How to structure models for ML inference</p>
<p>How a model registry helps organize your models for easy consumption</p>
<p>How you can set up reusable and easy-to-upgrade inference pipelines</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>// Abstract:</p>
<p>Translating the research that goes into creating a great deep learning model into a production application is a mess without the right tools. ML models have a lot of moving pieces, and on top of that models are constantly evolving as new data arrives or the model is tweaked. In this talk, we'll show how you can find order in that chaos by using the Determined Model Registry along with Kubeflow Pipelines.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Coffee Sessions #10 Analyzing the Article “Continuous Delivery and Automation Pipelines in Machine Learning" // Part 2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Second installation David and Demetrios reviewing the google paper about Continuous training and automated pipelines. They dive deep into machine learning monitoring and also what exactly continuous training actually entails. Some key highlights are:</p>
<p>Automatically retraining and serving the models: <br>
When to do it?<br>
Outlier detection<br>
Drift detection</p>
<p>Outlier detection:<br>
What is it?<br>
How you deal with it<br>
Drift detection<br>
Individual features may start to drift. This could be a bug or it could be perfectly normal behavior that indicates that the world has changed requiring the model to be retrained.</p>
<p>Example changes:<br>
shifts in people’s preferences<br>
marketing campaigns<br>
competitor moves<br>
the weather<br>
the news cycle<br>
Locations<br>
Time<br>
Devices (clients)</p>
<p>If the world you're working with is changing over time, model deployment should be treated as a continuous process. What this tells me is that you should keep the data scientists and engineers working on the model instead of immediately moving to another project.</p>
<p>Deeper dive into concept drift<br>
Feature/target distributions change</p>
<p>An overview of concept drift applications: “.. data analysis applications, data evolve over time and must be analyzed in near real time. Patterns and relations in such data often evolve over time, thus, models built for analyzing such data quickly become obsolete over time. In machine learning and data mining this phenomenon is referred to as concept drift.”<br>
https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/publications/pubs/CD_applications15.pdf<br>
https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/LEHRE/FACHPROJEKT/SS12/paper/concept-drift/tsymbal2004.pdf</p>
<p>Types of concept drift:<br>
Sudden<br>
Gradual<br>
Google in some way is trying to address this concern - the world is changing and you want your ML system to change as well so it can avoid decreased performance but also improve over time and adapt to its environment. This sort of robustness is necessary for certain domains.<br>
Continuous delivery and automation of pipelines (data, training, prediction service) was built with this in mind. Minimizing the commit-to-deploy interval and maximize the velocity software delivery and its components: maintainability, extensibility, and testability<br>
Then the pipeline is ready, you can now run it. So you can do this continuously. After the pipeline is deployed to the production environment, it will be executed automatically and repetitively to produce a trained model that is stored in a central model registry.<br>
This pipeline should be able to be run on a schedule or based on triggers: certain events that you have configured to your business domain - new data or drop in performance from the prod model.<br>
The link between the model artifact and the pipeline is never severed. What pipeline trained them? What data was extracted, validated and how was it prepared? What was the training configuration and how was it evaluated? Etc. metrics are key here! Lineage tracking!!!<br>
Keeping a close tie between the dev/experiment pipeline and the continuous production pipeline helps avoid inconsistencies between model artifacts produced by the pipeline and models beings served - hard to debug</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #34: Streaming Machine Learning with Apache Kafka and Tiered Storage // Kai Waehner, Confluent]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps Meetup #34! This week we talk to Kai Waehner about the beast that is apache kafka and how many different ways you can use it!</p>
<p>// Key takeaways:</p>
<p>-Kafka is much more than just messaging</p>
<p>-Kafka is the de facto standard for processing huge volumes of data at scale in real-time</p>
<p>-Kafka and Machine Learning are complementary for various use cases (including data integration, data processing, model training, model scoring, and monitoring)</p>
<p>// Abstract:</p>
<p>The combination of Apache Kafka, tiered storage, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow enables you to build one scalable, reliable, but also simple infrastructure for all machine learning tasks using the Apache Kafka ecosystem and Confluent Platform. This discussion features a predictive maintenance use case within a connected car infrastructure, but the discussed components and architecture are helpful in any industry.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #33 Owned By Statistics: How Kubeflow & MLOps Can Help Secure Your ML Workloads // David Aronchick - Head of Open Source ML Strategy at Azure]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>While machine learning is spreading like wildfire, very little attention has been paid to the ways that it can go wrong when moving from development to production. Even when models work perfectly, they can be attacked and/or degrade quickly if the data changes. Having a well understood MLOps process is necessary for ML security!</p>
<p>Using Kubeflow, we demonstrated how to the common ways machine learning workflows go wrong, and how to mitigate them using MLOps pipelines to provide reproducibility, validation, versioning/tracking, and safe/compliant deployment. We also talked about the direction for MLOps as an industry, and how we can use it to move faster, with less risk, than ever before.</p>
<p>David leads Open Source Machine Learning Strategy at Azure. This means he spends most of his time helping humans to convince machines to be smarter. He is only moderately successful at this. Previously, he led product management for Kubernetes on behalf of Google, launched Google Kubernetes Engine, and co-founded the Kubeflow project. He has also worked at Microsoft, Amazon and Chef and co-founded three startups. When not spending too much time in service of electrons, he can be found on a mountain (on skis), traveling the world (via restaurants) or participating in kid activities, of which there are a lot more than he remembers than when he was that age.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Coffee Sessions #9 Analyzing the Article “Continuous Delivery and Automation Pipelines in Machine Learning “ // Part 1]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this last episode, we covered how Google is thinking about MLOps and how automation plays a key part in their view of MLOps. We started to talk about CI, CD, and the role they play in a pipeline setup for CT. In the next episode, we'll pick up where we left off, starting our discussion of CT and some of the reasons you’d want to set up a pipeline with continuous training in the first place.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #31 // Creating Beautiful Ambient Music with Google Brain’s Music Transformer // Daniel Jeffries - Chief Technology Evangelist at Pachyderm]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We trained a Transformer neural net on ambient music to see if a machine can compose with the great masters. Ambient is a soft, flowing, ethereal genre of music that I’ve loved for decades. There are all kinds of ambient, from white noise, to tracks that mimic the murmur of soft summer rain in a sprawling forest, but Dan favors ambient that weaves together environmental sounds and dreamy, wavelike melodies into a single, lush tapestry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can machine learning ever hope to craft something so seemingly simple yet intricate? The answer is yes and it’s getting better and better with each passing year. It won’t be long before artists are co-composing with AI, using software that helps them weave their own masterpieces of sound.</p>
<p>In this talk, we looked at how we did it. Along the way we’ll listen to some more awesome samples that worked really well and some that didn’t work as well as we hoped. You can download the model to play around with yourself. Dam also shows you an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, with downloadable containers that you can string together with ease to train a masterful music-making machine learning model on your own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan Jeffries is Chief Technology Evangelist at Pachyderm. He’s also an author, engineer, futurist, pro blogger and he’s given talks all over the world on AI and cryptographic platforms. He’s spent more than two decades in IT as a consultant and at open source pioneer Red Hat.</p>
<p>With more than 50K followers on Medium, his articles have held the number one writer's spot on Medium for Artificial Intelligence, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Economics more than 25 times. &nbsp;His breakout AI tutorial series "Learning AI If You Suck at Math" along with his explosive pieces on cryptocurrency, "Why Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention of the Last 500 Years” and "Why Everyone Missed the Most Mind-Blowing Feature of Cryptocurrency,” are shared hundreds of times daily all over social media and been read by more than 5 million people worldwide.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps and DevOps have a large number of parallels. Many of the techniques, practices, and processes used for traditional software projects can be followed almost exactly in ML projects. However, the day-to-day of an ML project is usually significantly different from a traditional software project. So while the ideas and principles can still apply, it’s important to be aware of the core aims of DevOps when applying them.</p>
<p>Damian is a Cloud Advocate specializing in DevOps and MLOps. After spending a year in Toronto, Canada, he returned to Australia - the land of the dangerous creatures and beautiful beaches - in 2018. Formerly a dev at Octopus Deploy and a Microsoft MVP, he has a background in software development and consulting in a broad range of industries. In Australia, he co-organised the Brisbane .Net User Group, and launched the now annual DDD Brisbane conference. He regularly speaks at conferences, User Groups, and other events around the world. Most of the time you'll find him talking to software engineers, IT pros and managers to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategies.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #29 // Scaling Machine Learning Capabilities in Large Organizations // Bertjan Broeksema & Axel Goblet]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Machine learning has become an increasingly important means for organizations to extract value from their data. Many companies start off with successful proofs of value but face problems when scaling their capabilities afterward. By generalizing engineering problems and solving them centrally, scaling becomes much more feasible. Model serving platforms generalize the problem of turning a machine learning model in a value-generating application. Combining a serving platform with cultural shifts such as a shift-left approach enhances efficiency even further.</p>
<p>Bertjan is a Senior Data Engineer, with 15 years of experience in the software industry, specializing in data science and engineering for the last 10 years. He built a variety of data products and machine learning platforms. He have worked on both traditional desktop applications as well as cloud native applications in DevOps teams. He's a craftsman with a passion for delivering value through high quality software, aligning stakeholders and coaching junior and medior team members.</p>
<p>Axel has a background in data science. While getting his data science master degree, he did software engineering and data science projects for a wide range of customers. This experience taught him that the main complexity of data science projects lies in the software built around the predictive models. After finishing his degree, he joined BigData Republic. Axel currently helps companies bring their data science capabilities to the next level. His main interest lies in tooling that speeds up the development of machine learning applications.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Coffee Sessions #6 // Continuous Integration for ML // Featuring Elle O'Brien]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>David &amp; Elle talk about how one of the staples of DevOps, the practice of continuous integration, can work for machine learning. Continuous integration is a tried-and-true method for speeding up development cycles and rapidly releasing software- an area where data science and ML could use some help. Making continuous integration work for ML has been challenging in the past, and we chat about new open-source tools and approaches in the Git ecosystem for leveling up development processes with big models and datasets.</p>
<p>|| Highlights ||<br>
What is continuous integration and why should ML/data science teams know about it?<br>
Why ML projects tend to fall short of DevOps best practices, like frequent check-ins and testing<br>
How we're dealing with obstacles to get continuous integration working for ML<br>
Also, some fun chat about how data science roles are changing and how MLOps skills fit into the data science toolkit!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Most MLOps discussion traditionally focuses on model deployment, containerization, model serving - but where do the inputs come from and where do the outputs get used? In this session we demystify parts of the data science process used to create the all-important target variable and design machine learning experiments.</p>
<p>We discuss some probability and statistical concepts which are useful for MLOps professionals. Knowledge of these concepts may assist practitioners working closely with data scientists or those who aspire to build complex experimentation frameworks.</p>
<p>Danny is a recovering data scientist who has moved over to the dark side of ML engineering in the past 2 years. He has spent multiple years deploying ML models and designing customer experiments in retail and banking sectors. Danny's passion is to guide businesses and individuals on their AI &amp; machine learning journey. He believes a clear understanding of data strategy and applied machine learning will be a key differentiator in this brave new world. He currently provides personalised mentorship for 400+ aspiring data professionals through the #DataWithDanny community.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps #27 ML Observability // Aparna Dhinakaran - Chief Product Officer at Arize AI]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>As more and more machine learning models are deployed into production, it is imperative we have better observability tools to monitor, troubleshoot, and explain their decisions. In this talk, Aparna Dhinakaran, Co-Founder, CPO of Arize AI (Berkeley-based startup focused on ML Observability), will discuss the state of the commonly seen ML Production Workflow and its challenges. She will focus on the lack of model observability, its impacts, and how Arize AI can help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This talk highlights common challenges seen in models deployed in production, including model drift, data quality issues, distribution changes, outliers, and bias. The talk will also cover best practices to address these challenges and where observability and explainability can help identify model issues before they impact the business. Aparna will be sharing a demo of how the Arize AI platform can help companies validate their models performance, provide real-time performance monitoring and alerts, and automate troubleshooting of slices of model performance with explainability. The talk will cover best practices in ML Observability and how companies can build more transparency and trust around their models.</p>
<p>Aparna Dhinakaran is Chief Product Officer at Arize AI, a startup focused on ML Observability. She was previously an ML engineer at Uber, Apple, and Tubemogul (acquired by Adobe). During her time at Uber, she built a number of core ML Infrastructure platforms including Michaelangelo. She has a bachelors from Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program where she published research with Berkeley's AI Research group. She is on a leave of absence from the Computer Vision PhD program at Cornell University.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #26 // How to Leverage ML Tooling Ecosystem // Mariya Davydova - Head of Product at Neu.ro]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk, I demonstrate an example of an ML project development and production workflows which we build on top of our proprietary core - Neu.ro - using a number of open-source and proprietary tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Tensorboard, FileBrowser, PyCharm Professional, Cookiecutter, Git, DVC, Airflow, Seldon, and Grafana. I describe how we integrate each of these tools with Neu.ro, and how we can improve these integrations.</p>
<p>Mariya came to MLOps from a software development background. She started her career as a Java developer in JetBrains in 2011, then gradually moved to developer advocacy for JS-based APIs. In 2019, she joined Neu.ro as a platform developer advocate and then moved to the product management position. She has been obsessed with AI and ML for many years: she finished a bunch of courses, read a lot of books, and even wrote a couple of fiction stories about AI. She believes that proper tooling and decent development and operations practices are an essential success component for ML projects, as well as they are for traditional SD.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Coffee Sessions #3 MLOps: Isn't That Just DevOps? // Featuring Ryan Dawson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It can be tricky to explain MLOps to colleagues and managers who are used to traditional software engineering and DevOps, let alone your gran. We have to answer the 'Isn't that just DevOps?' question clearly, otherwise the challenges of MLOps will continue to be underestimated (potentially by us as well as others). In this session we dive into what is new about MLOps and why current mainstream DevOps alone does not solve the problems.</p>
<p>Ryan Dawson is an Engineer at Seldon and author of the article 'Why is DevOps for Machine Learning so Different?' You can find that article at https://hackernoon.com/why-is-devops-for-machine-learning-so-different-384z32f1</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to explain MLOps to colleagues and managers who are used to traditional software engineering and DevOps, let alone your gran. We have to answer the &apos;Isn&apos;t that just DevOps?&apos; question clearly, otherwise the challenges of MLOps will continue to be underestimated (potentially by us as well as others). In this session we dive into what is new about MLOps and why current mainstream DevOps alone does not solve the problems.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #25 // Python and Dask: Scaling the DataFrame // Dan Gerlanc - Founder of Enplus Advisors]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Python's most popular data science libraries—pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn—were designed to run on a single computer, and in some cases, using a single processor. Whether this computer is a laptop or a server with 96 cores, your compute and memory are constrained by the size of the biggest computer you have access to.</p>
<p>In this course, you'll learn how to use Dask, a Python library for parallel and distributed computing, to bypass this constraint by scaling our compute and memory across multiple cores. Dask provides integrations with Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn so you can scale your computations without having to learn completely new libraries or significantly refactoring your code.</p>
<p>Daniel Gerlanc has worked as a data scientist for more than decade and written software professionally for 15 years. He spent 5 years as a quantitative analyst with two Boston hedge funds before starting Enplus Advisors. At Enplus, he works with clients on data science and custom software development with a particular focus on projects requiring expertise in both areas. He teaches data science and software development at introductory through advanced levels. He has co-authored several open source R packages, published in peer-reviewed journals, and is active in local predictive analytics groups.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #23 // Monitoring the ML stack // Lina Weichbrodt]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>How To Monitor Machine Learning Stacks - Why Current Monitoring is Unable to Detect Serious Issues and What to Do About It with Lina Weichbrodt. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Monitoring usually focusses on the “four golden signals”: latency, errors, traffic, and saturation. Machine learning services can suffer from special types of problems that are hard to detect with these signals. The talk will introduce these problems with practical examples and suggests additional metrics that can be used to detect them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A case study demonstrates how these new metrics work for the recommendation stacks at Zalando, one of Europe’s largest fashion retailers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lina has 8+ years of industry experience in developing scalable machine learning models and bringing them into production. She currently works as the Machine Learning Lead Engineer in the data science group of the German online bank DKB. She previously worked at Zalando, one of Europe’s biggest online fashion retailers, where she developed real-time, deep learning personalization models for more than 32M users. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How to become a better data scientist: the definite guide with Alexey Grigorev</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We all know what we need to do to be good data scientists: know machine learning, be able to program, be fluent in SQL and Python. That’s enough to do our job quite well. But what does it take to be a better data scientist?</p>
<p>The best way to grow as a data scientist is to step out of direct responsibilities and try on the hats of a product manager as well as a DevOps engineer. In particular, we should:<br>
- be pragmatic and product-oriented<br>
- communicate more<br>
- get into infrastructure</p>
<p>After listening to this talk, you will know how exactly we should do it.</p>
<p>Alexey lives in Berlin with his wife and son. He’s a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He works at OLX Group as a Lead Data Scientist. Alexey is a Kaggle master and he wrote a couple of books. One of them is “Mastering Java for Data Science” and now he’s working on another one — “Machine Learning Bookcamp”.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Companies are increasingly investing in Machine Learning (ML) to deliver new customer experiences and re-invent business processes. Unfortunately, &nbsp;the &nbsp;majority &nbsp;of &nbsp;operational &nbsp;ML &nbsp;projects never make it to production. The most significant blocker is the lack of infrastructure and tooling required to build production-ready data for ML. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Kevin Stumpf has a long history of building data infrastructure for ML, first for Uber Michelangelo, and most recently as co-founder of Tecton. Kevin will share his insights on the challenges of getting ML features to production. We’ll discuss the role of the feature store in bringing DevOps-like efficiency to building ML features. Kevin will also provide an overview of Tecton, which aims to bring an enterprise-grade feature store to every company.</p>
<p>Kevin co-founded Tecton where he leads a world-class engineering team that is building a next-generation feature store for operational Machine Learning. Kevin and his co-founders built deep expertise in operational ML platforms while at Uber, where they created the Michelangelo platform that enabled Uber to scale from 0 to 1000's of ML-driven applications in just a few years. Prior to Uber, Kevin founded Dispatcher, with the vision to build the Uber for long-haul trucking. Kevin holds an MBA from Stanford University and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer and Management Sciences from the University of Hagen. Outside of work, Kevin is a passionate long-distance endurance athlete.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #18 // Nubank - Running a Fintech on ML // Caique Lima and Cristiano Breuel]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Running a Fintech on Machine Learning &nbsp;</p>
<p>For this meetup we sat down with Caique Lima and Cristiano Breuel Machine Learning Engineers at the Brasilian Fintech Nubank. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nubank is a Fintech providing credit and banking services to more than 20 million customers. Data science has been one of the company's pillars since the beginning, and many of its critical decisions in production are made with ML, in areas such as Credit, Fraud and Customer Service. We discussed how they develop, deploy and monitor ML models, and also talk about how they built those in house solutions over the years. Today they use MLOps to support a team of more than 70 Data Scientists/ Machine Learning Engineers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Caique is a Machine Learning Engineer at Nubank, developing software to scale decision making, this goes from model development to monitoring. Always trying to bring good practices from Software development to Data teams. &nbsp;Cristiano, a Machine Learning Engineer at Nubank, works to improve the efficiency and quality of ML development. Previously ML/Data Engineer at Google, specializing in MLOps, and Software Engineer at IBM. &nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #17 // The Challenges of ML Operations & How Hermione Helps Along the Way // Neylson Crepalde]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps.community meetup #17 a deep dive into the open source ML framework Hermoine built on top of MLflow with Neylson Crepalde &nbsp;</p>
<p>Key takeaways for attendees: MLOps problems are dealt with tools but also with processes Open-source framework Hermione can help in a lot of parts of the operations process &nbsp;</p>
<p>Abstract: <br>
In Neylson's experience with Machine Learning projects, he has encountered a series of challenges regarding agile processes to build and deploy ML models in a professional cooperative environment that fosters teamwork. While on this journey, Neylson and his team developed some of our their own solutions for these challenges. &nbsp;Out of this was the open-source project Hermoine born . Hermoine is a collection of solutions for these specific MLOps problems that were packaged into a library, an ML project structure framework called Hermione. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In this meetup we talk about these challenges, what they did to overcome them and how Hermione helped address these different issues along the way. We will also do a demo on how to build an ML project with Hermione. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Check out Hermoine here: https://github.com/a3data/hermione &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Neylson Crepalde is a partner and MLOps Tech Lead at A3Data. He holds a PhD in Economic Sociology, a masters in Sociology of Culture, an MBA in Cultural Management and a bachelor degree in Music/Conducting. He is professor of Machine Learning and Head of Data Science Department at Izabela Hendrix Methodist Technological University. His main research interests are Machine Learning processes, Politics and Deliberation, Economic Sociology and Sociology of Education. In his PhD he has worked with Multilevel Social Network Analysis and Exponential Random Graph Models to understand the social construction of quality in an orchestras’ market. &nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps Meetup #15 Scaling Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning with Robert Munro]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Human In The Loop Machine Learning and how to scale it with Robert Munro.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This conversation centered around the components of Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning systems and the challenges when scaling them. Most machine learning applications learn from human examples. For example, autonomous vehicles know what a pedestrian looks like because people have spent 1000s of hours labeling “pedestrians” in videos; your smart device understands you because people have spent 1000s of hours labeling the intent of speech recordings; and machine translation services work because they are trained on 1000s of sentences that have been manually translated between languages. If you have a machine learning system that is learning from human-feedback in real-time, then there are many components to support and scale, from the machine learning models to the human interfaces and the processes for quality control. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Munro is an expert in combining Human and Machine Intelligence, working with Machine Learning approaches to Text, Speech, Image and Video Processing. Robert has founded several AI companies, building some of the top teams in Artificial Intelligence. He has worked in many diverse environments, from Sierra Leone, Haiti and the Amazon, to London, Sydney and Silicon Valley, in organizations ranging from startups to the United Nations. He has shipped Machine Learning Products at startups and at/with Amazon, Google, IBM &amp; Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert has published more than 50 papers on Artificial Intelligence and is a regular speaker about technology in an increasingly connected world. He has a PhD from Stanford University. Robert is the author of Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning (Manning Publications, 2020) &nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps #14 Kubeflow vs MLflow with Byron Allen]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The amazing Byron Allen talks to us about why MLflow and Kubeflow are not playing the same game!<br>
<br>
ML flow vs Kubeflow is more like comparing apples to oranges or as he likes to make the analogy they are both cheese but one is an all-rounder and the other a high-class delicacy. This can be quite deceiving when analyzing the two. We do a deep dive into the functionalities of both and the pros/cons they have to offer.<br>
<br>
Byron is a Senior Consultant at Servian - a data consultancy in Australia that also has a footprint across APAC as well as the UK. Byron is based in the London office where he helps organizations discover and build competitive advantage through their data. His focus is on client advisory and consulting delivery related to Experiments and ProductionML (i.e. data science, experimental design, ML model development, MLOps).<br>
<br>
Byron has written about a wide range of topics including the divide between data engineer and scientist, the role of ML in the post-covid world, and Kubeflow vs. MLflow.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #11 Machine Learning at scale in Mercado Libre with Carlos de la Torre &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mercado Libre hosts the largest online commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America. The IT department built Fury: a PaaS framework for the development and deployment of multi-cloud, multi-technology, microservices. This platform leveraged the growth of the IT area, which now counts ~4000 people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, it lacked support for machine-learning based solutions: an experimentation environment for data-scientists, infrastructure and data access support for ETL and model’s training tasks, etc. &nbsp;Therefore, for over a year now, they have been developing Fury Data Apps (FDA). An extension of Fury to for the design, experimentation, development and deployment of machine-learning based solutions. It is already supporting ~500 users and some high-performance production APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this meetup we talk about the main features of the platform, the supporting technology and why Carlos never accepted my Linkedin request. <br>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps.community meetup #9 with Charles Martin - 10 years deploying Machine Learning in the Enterprise: The Inside Scoop! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do some machine learning projects succeed while others fall down completely? &nbsp;&nbsp;In this discussion, we will discuss the real-world challenges that Enterprises face in deploying ML solutions, focussing on challenges with existing, legacy dev-ops environments and how certain patterns of success emerge to help combat failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Martin runs a boutique consultancy in San Francisco, California that supports organizations looking to research, build, and deploy data science, machine learning, and AI products. &nbsp;He has worked with clients like eBay, Blackrock, GoDaddy as well as widely successful startups such as Aardvark (acquired by Google) and Demand Media (the first public Billion dollar IPO after Google). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a world-renowned researcher, collaborating with UC Berkeley on the WeightWatcher project, and has taught at UC Berkeley and Stanford, and spoken at KDD, ICML, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;He is also currently a scientific advisor to the Page family’s Anthropocene Institute, consulting on areas including modern nuclear and quantum technologies and their response to the current pandemic. &nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Meet up #10 Saurav Chakravorty sat down with us to talk about his vision of how MLOps reflect the old Indian story of blind men and an Elephant. As a lead data scientist at Brillo Saurav has build many MLOps pipelines and experienced using different ML platforms. He comes to talk with us about the difficulties of taking an ML platform from infancy to production and other key factors he has seen within the MLOps space. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today data science is a field that is an aggregation of people from various backgrounds - econometrics, statistics, engineering, business analysts, and data engineers. Each of these groups has different expectations from a Machine Learning platforms. But, each group faces problems that have some common challenges - improving reproducibility, reducing technical debt, reducing the time to try new experiments. The challenge before any MLOps system is to create platforms and processes that address the needs of each of these groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saurav is a tinkerer in the Machine Learning world with experience in the design and development of ML applications and processes. &nbsp;In the past few years, he has been focused on improving the processes and tools around the Machine Learning teams. he explores the ideas of Auto ML, ML Ops, and model evaluation. He helps customers adopt and use the best tools and processes that allow them to scale their Data Science or Machine Learning tools. He has development experience in the open stack ML platforms and of late the managed ML services from Azure and AWS. &nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Linkedin, Spotify, Volvo, JP Morgan, and many other market leaders are leveraging Kubeflow to simplify the creation and the efficient deployment of Machine Learning models on Kubernetes. &nbsp;This presentation will provide an update on the Kubeflow 1.0 release, and review the Community’s best practices to support Critical User Journeys, which optimize ML workflows.</p>
<p>As a data scientist will often need to build (and save) hundreds of variants of their model, this session will provide a deeper dive into how an integrated storage solution simplifies model-building and increases ML productivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentation will examine how to optimize the daily workflows of data scientists, and eliminate complex and time-consuming manual tasks. &nbsp;&nbsp;The talk will also highlight how efficient Kubeflow operations rely on Kubernetes storage primitives, such as Dynamic Volume Provisioning, Persistent Volumes and StatefulSets. &nbsp;This integrated solution simplifies the configuration, operations and data protection for Kubeflow and generic K8s stateful apps in production-grade, multi-user environments.</p>
<p>Bio:</p>
<p>Josh Bottum is a Kubeflow Community Product Manager. His Community responsibilities include assisting users to quantify Kubeflow business value, develop critical user journeys (CUJs), triage incoming user issues, prioritize feature delivery, write release announcements and deliver Kubeflow presentations and demonstrations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Bottum is also a VP of Arrikto. Arrikto simplifies storage operations for stateful Kubernetes applications by enabling efficient local storage architectures with data durability and portability. &nbsp;Arrikto is a core code contributor to Kubeflow.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps meetup #7- Machine Learning and Open Banking with Alex Spanos of TrueLayer]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>What does the MLOps pipeline at London Based FinTech startup TrueLayer look like? &nbsp;</p>
<p>London Based Fintech start-up TrueLayer decided to use Machine Learning instead of a rule-based system in mid-2019 and in our 7th meetup we spoke to their lead data scientist Alex Spanos about everything that entailed. &nbsp;&nbsp;During the meetup, we dove into how TrueLayer architected their MLOps pipeline for their Open Banking API: more specifically which tools they use and why, what prompted them to use machine learning, and how Alex sees the role of a Machine Learning Engineer. Alex has led the hiring process of Machine Learning Engineers and shared learnings on candidates and businesses alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex is the Lead Data Scientist at TrueLayer, focussing on building Open Banking API products powered by data. Prior to TrueLayer, he built predictive models in Financial Services, used social data to predict the “next-big-thing” in Fast Moving Consumer Goods and introduced Machine Learning techniques in subsurface imaging. &nbsp;</p>
<p>His academic background is in Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics. &nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps.community #5 - High Stakes ML: Latent Conditions and Active Failures with Flavio Clesio]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In our 5th meetup, we spoke with the Brasilian ML Engineer Flavio Clesio.</p>
<p>Machine Learning Systems play a huge role in several businesses from the Banking industry to recommender systems in entertainment applications until health domains. The era of "<em>A Data Scientist with a Script in a single machine</em>" is officially over in high stakes ML.</p>
<p>We're entering an era of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) where those critical applications that impact society and businesses need to be aware of aspects like active failures and latent conditions. This talk will discuss risk assessment in ML Systems from the perspective of reliability, safety and especially causal aspects that can lead to the rise of silent risks in said systems.</p>
<p>Slides to the talk can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gP0A_EXLYafeYAak_vM8lA2nwT7EBaNv3QAWkzBC004/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong>:</p>
<p>Flavio Clesio is Machine Learning Engineer (NLP, CV, Marketplace RecSys) and at the moment works at MyHammer AG, where he helps build Core Machine Learning applications to exploit revenue opportunities and automation in decision making.</p>
<p>Prior to MyHammer, Flavio was a Data Intelligence lead in the mobile industry, and business intelligence analyst in financial markets, specifically in Non-Performing Loans. He holds a master’s degree in computational intelligence applied in financial markets (exotic credit derivatives).</p>

			<title><![CDATA[MLOps.community #4 - Building an ML platform @SurveyMonkey with Shubhi Jain]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://mlops.community/"><strong>MLOps Community</strong></a><strong> Meetup #4 With Shubhi Jain</strong></p>
<p>In the 4th online meetup for our MLOps.community We spoke with Shubhi Jain, Machine Learning Engineer and an all-around great guy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every organization is leveraging machine learning (ML) to provide increasing value to their customers and understand their business. You may have created models too. But, how do you scale this process now? In this case study, we looked at how to pinpoint inefficiencies in your ML data flow, how SurveyMonkey tackled this, and how to make your data more usable to accelerate ML model development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Shubhi Jain is a machine learning engineer at SurveyMonkey where he develops and implements machine learning systems for its products and teams. Occasionally, he’ll create YouTube videos about Machine Learning in collaboration with Springboard, an e-learning platform. He’s always excited to bring his expertise and passion for Data and AI systems to the rest of the industry. In his free time, Shubhi likes hiking with his dog and accelerating his hearing loss at live music shows. &nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Hierarchy of Machine Learning Needs // Phil Winder // MLOps Meetup #3]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>MLOps community meetup #3! Last Wednesday we talked to Phil Winder, CEO, Winder Research.<br>
<br>
//Abstract<br>
Phil Winder of Winder Research joined us for the 3rd instalment of our MLOps community meetup. In this clip taken from the long conversation, he speaks about why or why not he sees companies automating the retraining of Machine Learning Models. You can find the whole conversation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRES5IxVnME &nbsp;</p>
<p>The topic of conversation for our virtual meetup was an in-depth look at a pyramid of software engineering best practices that built up to incorporate data science best practices. That is to say, we analyzed “the essentials”, "nice to have" and "optimal" ways of doing data science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine Learning/Data Science/AI is an extension of the technical stack. So you can't really talk about Data science best practices without accidentally talking about software engineering best practices. For example, model provenance doesn't count for anything if you don't have code or container provenance. &nbsp;Just as Maslow has the basic human needs so too do we have basic MLOps needs. Where does "MLOps", as a "thing", starts and end? For example, the four very reasonable best practices of the operation of models, but these are usually consumed into higher-level abstractions because there is a lot more to do than "just" provenance. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
//Bio<br>
Dr Phil Winder is a multidisciplinary software engineer and data scientist. As the CEO of Winder Research, a Cloud-Native data science consultancy, he helps startups and enterprises improve their data-based processes, platforms, and products. Phil specializes in implementing production-grade cloud-native machine learning and was an early champion of the MLOps movement. More recently, Phil has authored a book on Reinforcement Learning (RL) (https://rl-book.com) which provides an in-depth introduction of industrial RL to engineers. &nbsp;He has thrilled thousands of engineers with his data science training courses in public, private, and on the O’Reilly online learning platform. Phil’s courses focus on using data science in industry and cover a wide range of hot yet practical topics, from cleaning data to deep reinforcement learning. He is a regular speaker and is active in the data science community. &nbsp;Phil holds a PhD and M.Eng. in electronic engineering from the University of Hull and lives in Yorkshire, U.K., with his brewing equipment and family.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3>MLOps community meetup #2! Last Wednesday we talked to Charles Radclyffe, Technology Governance and ESG Specialist, AI Ethics.<strong><br>
<br>
What does best in class AI/ML governance look like in financial services?</strong></h3>
<p>For this episode, we are joined by Charles Radclyffe, who until very recently was the Head of AI at Fidelity. Some of his other feats include starting 3 companies, <a href="https://dataphilos.wpengine.com/#TEDx-Talk"><u>TEDx</u></a> talks, and advising the likes of HSBC, Barclays, Morgan &amp; Stanley, and Deutsche Bank. He has focused his career on solving tough technology challenges for some of the world's largest organizations, for more on him, follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/dataphilosopher"><u>twitter</u></a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radclyffe"><u>LinkedIn</u></a></p>
<p>Governance is coming for us all, but it’s especially pertinent in regulated industries such as the finance sector. Financial institutions must be mindful of how their machine learning models are being used and experimented with as regulators are keen to understand the quality of controls across the industry.</p>
<p>Our conversation is centered around Charles’ past experiences heading up the AI capability for a large organization in the financial industry, and his learnings during that time. We will also touch on what ideal AI/ML governance looks like in his eyes and where he sees we need to focus our attention for future success within this area. What do data scientists and ML engineers need to learn about governance to ensure business success as laws are continually changing?</p>
<p>This episode is a virtual fireside chat for the first 40 minutes and in the last 20 minutes we open up the floor to any questions. Please feel free to join our <a href="https://bit.ly/33wDUf1"><u>slack channel</u></a> or <a href="https://forum.mlops.community/"><u>forum</u></a> to chat more about MLOps.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The 1st MLOps.community meetup on 3.18.2020 featuring Luke Marsden from Dotscience.<br>
<br>
What is MLOps and how can it help me work remotely? The first episode of our weekly MLOps community virtual meetup with CEO and founder of the MLOps platform dotscience Luke Marsden talk to us about the current state of Machine Learning, what some of the main difficulties are at this stage when developing models, how the machine learning lifecycle differs from traditional software development and a deep dive of collaboration for data science teams in a fully remote world.<br>
<br>
MLOps is the intersection of three disciplines: software engineering, DevOps and machine learning. MLOps refers to the entire end-to-end lifecycle of getting models from lab to live where they can start delivering value.<br>
<br>
What do software engineers and DevOps need to learn about machine learning to ensure that it can be integrated into their dev &amp; deployment pipelines? What do data scientists and ML engineers need to learn about DevOps, model deployment and monitoring to ensure they can effectively deploy their work without racking up tonnes of technical debt? And now that working from home is fast becoming the new normal, how can MLOps help my team stay efficient when asynchronous collaboration is needed, something our software engineering and DevOps friends have already mastered?<br>
<br>
MLOps is a complex discipline due to the many more moving parts involved than regular software DevOps, in this inaugural MLOps.community meetup we'll explore and navigate this new space together and give you a guide on how to avoid the most common pitfalls and challenges getting AI into production and collaborating effectively with your team – even when you're distributed.<br>
