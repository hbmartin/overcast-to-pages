			<description><![CDATA[<p>Follow me on 𝕏: https://x.com/tejaskumar_</p><br><p>This podcast episode dives deep into the world of Event Sourcing, a powerful architectural pattern used in modern software development. Beginning with a clear definition of Event Sourcing, the episode explores its roots in Domain Driven Design and its critical role in recording and storing every change made to the state of an application in an event store. I break down complex topics, such as the nature of events, the intricacies of implementing Event Sourcing in real-world applications, and the various benefits and challenges associated with this approach.</p><br><p>Listeners will gain insights into the practical aspects of Event Sourcing, including detailed discussions on storage costs, computational expenses, and the practice of snapshotting to optimize performance. The episode also covers the concept of event ownership, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and ensuring data consistency using Apache Kafka, a distributed event streaming platform known for its high throughput, reliability, and scalability.</p><br><p>Further, the episode delves into Kafka's performance mechanisms, its use as an event store, and the transition from Zookeeper to KRaft for cluster coordination. Alternatives to Kafka, such as using Postgres' Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) as an event store, are examined, providing listeners with a comprehensive view of the options available for implementing Event Sourcing.</p><br><p>The discussion extends to real-life use cases of Event Sourcing, highlighting its application across various industries and projects.

Remote work can also present challenges, as the lack of boundaries between work and home can lead to excessive work hours.

Paul explains that the future of software is one where it does the work for us, and Browserbase is designed to power this future by providing a programmable web browser for AI applications.&nbsp;</p><br><p>We also touch on the challenges of running browser automation frameworks in production and how Browserbase solves these challenges. Paul introduces Stagehand, an open-source SDK that helps developers automate web workflows, and emphasizes the importance of ethical use of browser automation tools. Customers are building various applications on Browserbase, including web scraping, testing, AI agents, B2B software, and professional services.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The company has experienced rapid growth, with thousands of hours of browser sessions per week. To handle the scale, Browserbase had to make architectural changes, such as moving from Postgres to ClickHouse for better performance. They also had to address challenges like connection management, resource allocation, and debugging customer issues. The founder believes they have achieved product-market fit based on strong customer retention and repeatable growth strategies.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Browserbase is a technical product, so the number one priority for hiring is that candidates are technical and understand what Browserbase does. The team is currently focused on growing the top of the funnel and the sales edge side. They have specific roles for growth engineers and customer-focused engineers. The company recently raised a Series A round of $27M, with the goal of becoming a category-defining infrastructure company.

He shares his background in the Python community and his experience with open source sustainability. Chad explains the importance of community in open source and the origins of the free software movement.

The current approach to funding open source involves jumping through hoops and finding adjacent business models to subsidize the work. This is not a sustainable solution. The concept of fair source, where compensation is required for commercial use of open source software, offers a potential solution.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Links</p><br><p>- Codecrafters (sponsor): https://tej.as/codecrafters</p><p>- Santosh on X: https://x.com/SantoshYadavDev</p><p>- Santosh' story: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/my-journey-into-tech-from-slums-of-mumbai-to-my-own-apartment/</p><p>- Tejas on X: https://x.com/tejaskumar_</p><br><p>Summary</p><br><p>In this episode, we deep dive into Angular and its related frameworks, along with the power of open source to change one's life—moving Santosh from the slums of Mumbai to Germany, where he now owns a home. If you're interested in Angular, web engineering, or open source, then this episode is for you.</p><br><p>Takeaways</p><br><p>1. Santosh Yadav started his career in software development with Windows development before transitioning to web development with Angular.</p><p>2. Web development presented challenges such as cross-browser compatibility and deployment, which were not as prevalent in Windows development.</p><p>3. Santosh emphasizes the importance of contributing to the open source community and shares his journey of contributing to the Angular community.</p><p>4. Modern Angular has simplified the building blocks and introduced standalone components, making it easier to learn and use.</p><p>5. Angular Universal and Angular SSR provide server-side rendering and file-based routing capabilities in Angular applications.</p><p>6. Modern Angular has shifted from constructor-based injection to function parameter-based injection, which offers advantages such as easier use of services outside the constructor.</p><p>7. Components in Angular should be minimal and focused on UI rendering, with logic and data dependencies handled by services.</p><p>8.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Links</p><br><p>- Codecrafters (sponsor): https://tej.as/codecrafters</p><p>- Santosh on X: https://x.com/SantoshYadavDev</p><p>- Santosh' story: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/my-journey-into-tech-from-slums-of-mumbai-to-my-own-apartment/</p><p>- Tejas on X: https://x.com/tejaskumar_</p><br><p>Summary</p><br><p>In this episode, we deep dive into Angular and its related frameworks, along with the power of open source to change one's life—moving Santosh from the slums of Mumbai to Germany, where he now owns a home. If you're interested in Angular, web engineering, or open source, then this episode is for you.</p><br><p>Takeaways</p><br><p>1. Santosh Yadav started his career in software development with Windows development before transitioning to web development with Angular.</p><p>2. Web development presented challenges such as cross-browser compatibility and deployment, which were not as prevalent in Windows development.</p><p>3. Santosh emphasizes the importance of contributing to the open source community and shares his journey of contributing to the Angular community.</p><p>4. Modern Angular has simplified the building blocks and introduced standalone components, making it easier to learn and use.</p><p>5. Angular Universal and Angular SSR provide server-side rendering and file-based routing capabilities in Angular applications.</p><p>6. Modern Angular has shifted from constructor-based injection to function parameter-based injection, which offers advantages such as easier use of services outside the constructor.</p><p>7. Components in Angular should be minimal and focused on UI rendering, with logic and data dependencies handled by services.</p><p>8. Constructive collaboration and empathy are essential in open source projects, and discussions and contributions should be made on GitHub rather than on social media platforms.</p><p>9. Sharing personal stories and experiences in the open source community can inspire and motivate others. Education can be a powerful tool for overcoming challenging circumstances.</p><p>10. Perseverance and hard work are key to achieving success.</p><br><p>Chapters</p><br><p>00:00 Santosh Yadav</p><p>03:00 Introduction and Background</p><p>11:03 Open Source Contributions</p><p>32:30 Server-Side Rendering and File-Based Routing</p><p>40:53 Modern Angular and Dependency Injection</p><p>52:59 The Power of Nx as a Build Tool</p><p>01:03:42 Constructive Collaboration in Open Source</p><p>01:20:50 Living in the Slums and the Start of Santosh's Journey</p><p>01:31:11 Burnout and the Need for Work-Life Balance</p><p>01:44:51 Future Plans and Helping Others</p><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

The confusion around the term 'edge' arises from the conflation of network edge and edge compute. In this conversation, we discuss the challenges and misconceptions surrounding the concept of the edge in web development.</p><br><p>Glauber also explains how messaging and positioning are crucial in the success of a startup, and how validation should be carefully considered. He also highlights the importance of moving fast and adapting to the needs of users. He emphasizes that replication is a core feature of Turso, allowing for high availability and performance, and the ability to replicate data closer to users for faster access.</p><br><p>Takeaways</p><br><p>1.

From the initial introduction to Sentry's comprehensive suite of features, we explore how Sentry instruments a broad array of software, ensuring peak performance and minimal errors. The discussion includes a comparative analysis with TypeScript, highlighting Sentry's unique approach to software instrumentation and its focus on privacy and security.</p><br><p>We further investigate Sentry's capabilities in de-obfuscating code with source maps, offering insights into the nuanced differences between Replay.io, session replay technologies, and Sentry's innovative solutions. The spotlight shines on Sentry's dev-time monitoring, trace propagation within database transactions, and its distinct differentiators that set it apart from competitors. Notably, the episode covers Sentry's report on the most common pitfalls in apps, akin to a Spotify Wrapped but for software errors, providing a deep dive into error and stack proximity reporting with Sentry.</p><br><p>Performance metrics, such as the Apdex score and Core Web Vitals, including Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), are thoroughly examined, alongside strategies for mitigating CLS and addressing font-related issues like Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) and Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT). The episode proposes innovative solutions, such as tree shaking for font glyphs and dynamic font replacement to prevent layout shifts and text visibility problems.</p><br><p>Listeners will gain insights into Sentry's internals, including its architecture, use of Rust, and data storage strategies. The episode also discusses the scale challenges Sentry has overcome and how Sentry employs its own tools for self-monitoring. The conversation concludes with guidance on when to avoid Sentry and reiterates best practices for utilizing Sentry to its full potential, ensuring listeners are equipped with the knowledge to tackle common software performance issues effectively.</p><br><p>Chapters</p><p>00:00 - Intro</p><p>01:07 - Sponsor</p><p>01:51 - Greetings</p><p>02:53 - Defining Sentry's Suite of Features</p><p>04:43 - How does Sentry instrument a wide variety of software?</p><p>09:32 - Sentry compared to TypeScript</p><p>12:31 - Sentry and Privacy</p><p>16:57 - De-obfuscating Code with Source Maps</p><p>19:46 - Replay.io vs. Session Replay and Sentry</p><p>21:20 - Sentry Spotlight and Dev-Time Monitoring</p><p>25:07 - Propagating a Trace inside a Database Transaction</p><p>27:38 - Sentry Differentiators</p><p>35:58 - Sentry Report of Most Common Pitfalls in Apps, like Spotify Wrapped but with Sentry</p><p>39:42 - Children and error/stack proximity with Sentry reporting</p><p>42:22 - The Apdex as a Performance Metric</p><p>44:56 - Performance and Core Web Vitals</p><p>49:20 - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</p><p>54:43 - Where does CLS happen in the rendering process and mitigation steps</p><p>58:19 - Fonts as a source of CLS, FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text), and FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)</p><p>01:05:11 - Free Open Source Project Idea: Tree Shaking for Font Glyphs</p><p>01:05:57 - Replacing fonts when loaded to prevent CLS, FOIT, and FOUT</p><p>01:08:51 - How Sentry helps with Core Web Vitals</p><p>01:11:49 - Sentry Internals: Architecture, Data Stores, Rust</p><p>01:17:21 - Scale Problems that Sentry went through</p><p>01:19:12 - Does Sentry use Sentry?

From the initial introduction to Sentry's comprehensive suite of features, we explore how Sentry instruments a broad array of software, ensuring peak performance and minimal errors. The discussion includes a comparative analysis with TypeScript, highlighting Sentry's unique approach to software instrumentation and its focus on privacy and security.</p><br><p>We further investigate Sentry's capabilities in de-obfuscating code with source maps, offering insights into the nuanced differences between Replay.io, session replay technologies, and Sentry's innovative solutions. The spotlight shines on Sentry's dev-time monitoring, trace propagation within database transactions, and its distinct differentiators that set it apart from competitors. Notably, the episode covers Sentry's report on the most common pitfalls in apps, akin to a Spotify Wrapped but for software errors, providing a deep dive into error and stack proximity reporting with Sentry.</p><br><p>Performance metrics, such as the Apdex score and Core Web Vitals, including Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), are thoroughly examined, alongside strategies for mitigating CLS and addressing font-related issues like Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) and Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT). The episode proposes innovative solutions, such as tree shaking for font glyphs and dynamic font replacement to prevent layout shifts and text visibility problems.</p><br><p>Listeners will gain insights into Sentry's internals, including its architecture, use of Rust, and data storage strategies. The episode also discusses the scale challenges Sentry has overcome and how Sentry employs its own tools for self-monitoring. The conversation concludes with guidance on when to avoid Sentry and reiterates best practices for utilizing Sentry to its full potential, ensuring listeners are equipped with the knowledge to tackle common software performance issues effectively.</p><br><p>Chapters</p><p>00:00 - Intro</p><p>01:07 - Sponsor</p><p>01:51 - Greetings</p><p>02:53 - Defining Sentry's Suite of Features</p><p>04:43 - How does Sentry instrument a wide variety of software?</p><p>09:32 - Sentry compared to TypeScript</p><p>12:31 - Sentry and Privacy</p><p>16:57 - De-obfuscating Code with Source Maps</p><p>19:46 - Replay.io vs. Session Replay and Sentry</p><p>21:20 - Sentry Spotlight and Dev-Time Monitoring</p><p>25:07 - Propagating a Trace inside a Database Transaction</p><p>27:38 - Sentry Differentiators</p><p>35:58 - Sentry Report of Most Common Pitfalls in Apps, like Spotify Wrapped but with Sentry</p><p>39:42 - Children and error/stack proximity with Sentry reporting</p><p>42:22 - The Apdex as a Performance Metric</p><p>44:56 - Performance and Core Web Vitals</p><p>49:20 - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</p><p>54:43 - Where does CLS happen in the rendering process and mitigation steps</p><p>58:19 - Fonts as a source of CLS, FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text), and FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)</p><p>01:05:11 - Free Open Source Project Idea: Tree Shaking for Font Glyphs</p><p>01:05:57 - Replacing fonts when loaded to prevent CLS, FOIT, and FOUT</p><p>01:08:51 - How Sentry helps with Core Web Vitals</p><p>01:11:49 - Sentry Internals: Architecture, Data Stores, Rust</p><p>01:17:21 - Scale Problems that Sentry went through</p><p>01:19:12 - Does Sentry use Sentry?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Follow me on 𝕏: https://x.com/tejaskumar_</p><br><p>Dive into the fascinating world of computing with our podcast episode titled "How do computers actually work? From electrons to hardware to the web." We unravel the mystery starting from the fundamental building blocks of technology—electrons, and how they power datacenters, to the intricacies of hardware and firmware. Journey through the critical layers of computing, including the OS kernel, CPU operations, memory management, and storage solutions. Security gets its due with an exploration of TPM, setting the stage for a deep dive into software architecture.
