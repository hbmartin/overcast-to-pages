      <itunes:subtitle>Eoin O'Mahony—data science partner at Lightspeed, former Uber science lead, and co-designer of the system that kept NYC’s Citi Bikes available across the city—argues that positive metrics are meaningless if you don’t understand the mechanism behind them. At Uber, he was careful to make sure his launches both looked good on paper and made sense in practice. Now in venture, he’s applying that same rigor to unstructured data—using GenAI to scale a kind of work that’s long resisted systematization.</itunes:subtitle>

In this episode, she shares high-stakes failure stories (like a $100M schema change), explains why full-stack observability is becoming essential, and breaks down how LLM agents are already transforming data debugging.

        <![CDATA[<p>Barr Moses—co-founder and CEO of Monte Carlo—thinks we’re headed for an AI reckoning. Companies are building fast, but most are still managing data like it’s 2015. In this episode, she shares high-stakes failure stories (like a $100M schema change), explains why full-stack observability is becoming essential, and breaks down how LLM agents are already transforming data debugging. From culture to tooling, this is a sharp look at what real AI readiness requires—and why so few teams have it.</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>Stefan Wager—Professor at Stanford and expert on causal machine learning—has worked with leading tech companies including Dropbox, Facebook, Google, and Uber. He challenges the widespread assumption that better predictions mean better decisions. Traditional machine learning excels at prediction, but is prediction really what your business needs? Stefan explores why predictive models alone often fail to answer critical “what-if” questions, how causal machine learning bridges this gap, and provides practical advice for how you can start applying causal ML at work.</itunes:subtitle>

      <description>In this episode of High Signal, Eric Colson—former Chief Algorithms Officer at Stitch Fix and VP of Data Science and Machine Learning at Netflix—breaks down why most companies fail to unlock the full potential of their data science teams. Drawing from years of experience leading data functions at top tech companies, Eric shares how organizations can shift from treating data scientists as a service function to empowering them as strategic drivers of business impact.  
Key topics from the conversation include:  
Data Science as a Strategic Function: Why many companies limit their data teams to answering business requests instead of leveraging their ideas for competitive advantage.  
Beyond Skills—The Power of Cognitive Repertoires: How data scientists' unique ways of framing problems can lead to breakthrough innovations.  
Trial and Error as a Competitive Advantage: Why most experiments fail—but scaling experimentation is the key to big wins.  
Decoupling Algorithms from Applications: How separating data science from engineering enables rapid iteration and direct business impact.  
Shifting from Cost Center to Revenue Generator: Practical steps for structuring data teams to drive measurable value and long-term success.  
💡 Tune in to learn how leading companies structure their data teams for impact, why experimentation beats rigid planning, and how treating data science as a strategic function can unlock new business opportunities.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of High Signal, Chris Wiggins—Chief Data Scientist at The New York Times, Professor at Columbia University, and co-author of How Data Happened—shares how organizations can move beyond prediction to actionable decision systems. Drawing on his work at The New York Times and in academia, Chris explains how to scale data teams, optimize systems, and align data science with organizational impact.</p>

<p>Key topics from the conversation include:<br>
    • From Prediction to Prescription: Why organizations need to focus on interventions that drive outcomes, illustrated with insights like, “Imagine a hospital prescribing treatments instead of just diagnosing conditions.”<br>
    • The AI Hierarchy of Needs: Foundational practices, such as data logging and engineering, that enable advanced machine learning and AI.<br>
    • Personalization and Optimization: How reinforcement learning and exploration-exploitation methods help optimize KPIs and adapt to user context.<br>
    • Scaling Data Teams: Strategies for attracting and retaining talent by emphasizing autonomy, mastery, and purpose.<br>
    • Empathy as a Data Science Skill: The importance of collaborating with other teams and understanding their goals to drive adoption and success.</p>

      <description>Ramesh Johari (Stanford, Uber, Airbnb, and more) explores the art and science of online experimentation, especially in the context of marketplaces and tech companies.
Ramesh shares insights on how organizations evolve from basic experimentation practices to becoming fast, adaptive, and self learning organizations. We dive into challenges like the risk aversion trap, the importance of learning from negative results, and how generative AI is reshaping the experimentation landscape.
We also talk about common failure modes and the types of things you're probably doing wrong, along with strategies to avoid these pitfalls.  Plus, we discussed the role of incentives, the necessity of data driven decision making, and what it means to experiment in high stakes environments.
