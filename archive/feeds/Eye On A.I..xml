In this episode, Patrick Pilarski, Canada CIFAR AI Chair and professor at the University of Alberta, breaks down The Alberta Plan—a bold roadmap for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through reinforcement learning and real-time experience-based AI.</p> <p dir="ltr">Unlike large pre-trained models that rely on massive datasets, The Alberta Plan champions continual learning, where AI evolves from raw sensory experience, much like a child learning through trial and error. Could this be the key to unlocking true intelligence?</p> <p dir="ltr">Pilarski also shares insights from his groundbreaking work in bionic medicine, where AI-powered prosthetics are transforming human-machine interaction. From neuroprostheses to reinforcement learning-driven robotics, this conversation explores how AI can enhance—not just replace—human intelligence.</p> What You’ll Learn in This Episode: <ul> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Why reinforcement learning is a better path to AGI than pre-trained models</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The four core principles of The Alberta Plan and why they matter</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">How AI-driven bionic prosthetics are revolutionizing human-machine integration</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The battle between reinforcement learning and traditional control systems in robotics</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Why continual learning is critical for AI to avoid catastrophic forgetting</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">How reinforcement learning is already powering real-world breakthroughs in plasma control, industrial automation, and beyond</p> </li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">The future of AI isn’t just about more data—it’s about AI that thinks, adapts, and learns from experience.</p> <p dir="ltr">If you're curious about the next frontier of AI, the rise of reinforcement learning, and the quest for true intelligence, this episode is a must-watch.</p> <p dir="ltr">Subscribe for more AI deep dives!</p> <p> </p> <p dir="ltr">(00:00) The Alberta Plan: A Roadmap to AGI  </p> <p dir="ltr">(02:22) Introducing Patrick Pilarski</p> <p dir="ltr">(05:49) Breaking Down The Alberta Plan’s Core Principles  </p> <p dir="ltr">(07:46) The Role of Experience-Based Learning in AI  </p> <p dir="ltr">(08:40) Reinforcement Learning vs. Pre-Trained Models  </p> <p dir="ltr">(12:45) The Relationship Between AI, the Environment, and Learning  </p> <p dir="ltr">(16:23) The Power of Reward in AI Decision-Making  </p> <p dir="ltr">(18:26) Continual Learning & Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting  </p> <p dir="ltr">(21:57) AI in the Real World: Applications in Fusion, Data Centers & Robotics  </p> <p dir="ltr">(27:56) AI Learning Like Humans: The Role of Predictive Models  </p> <p dir="ltr">(31:24) Can AI Learn Without Massive Pre-Trained Models?  </p> <p dir="ltr">(35:19) Control Theory vs. Reinforcement Learning in Robotics  </p> <p dir="ltr">(40:16) The Future of Continual Learning in AI  </p> <p dir="ltr">(44:33) Reinforcement Learning in Prosthetics: AI & Human Interaction  </p> <p dir="ltr">(50:47) The End Goal of The Alberta Plan  </p> <p>  </p>]]></content:encoded>

We dissect the Future of Life Institute’s role in overseeing large language model development. As well as the sobering warnings issued by the Centre for AI Safety regarding artificial general intelligence.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In this episode, Ben Sorscher, a PhD student at Stanford, sheds light on the challenges posed by the ever-increasing size of data sets used to train machine learning models, specifically large language models. The sheer size of these data sets has been pushing the limits of scaling, as the cost of training and the environmental impact of the electricity they consume becomes increasingly enormous.<br /> <br /> As a solution, Ben discusses the concept of “data pruning” - a method of reducing the size of data sets without sacrificing model performance. Data pruning involves selecting the most important or representative data points and removing the rest, resulting in a smaller, more efficient data set that still produces accurate results.<br /> <br /> Throughout the podcast, Ben delves into the intricacies of data pruning, including the benefits and drawbacks of the technique, the practical considerations for implementing it in machine learning models, and the potential impact it could have on the field of artificial intelligence.<br /> <br /> Craig Smith Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/craigss">https://twitter.com/craigss</a><a href="https://bit.ly/3ZBokKu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /></a>Eye on A.I.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Eye on AI, I continue my review of AI research in different regions of the world with a focus on Europe. Europe, with its strong academic tradition, faces unique challenges in scientific research because of the continent's fragmentation and the weakening of the European Union. Given the growing dominance of North America and China, Europe risks being left behind. To understand what Europe is doing to avoid this, I talk to Bernhard Schölkopf and Matthias Bethge, two machine learning researchers from Tübingen, Germany, who have been working to bring machine learning research in Europe under one umbrella.  I hope you find Bernhard and Matthias as interesting as I did. </p>]]></description>

Ben has been instrumental in unifying and upgrading the continent’s machine-learning capabilities in hopes of making Africa a player in the artificial intelligence revolution. If you wanted to know what’s going on with AI in Africa, Ben will fill you in. I hope you find him as interesting as I did.</p>]]></description>

Julian works on AI for games and games for AI. Some of his most significant work is in training deep neural networks to play video games and generalize what they have learned, a critical step toward artificial general intelligence. For those of you who don't understand the importance of video games to artificial intelligence research, Julian will enlighten you.

When I spoke to Miles, he was a research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, where he remains an associate. We talked about the policy side of AI security and whether he is optimistic that regulations can steer machine learning applications away from the nightmare scenarios popularly imagined. I hope you find Miles as interesting as I did.</p>]]></description>

Kaifu just published the book, <a class="" href= "https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X"> <span class="">AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order</span></a>. We talked about the premise of the book, which is that China has already caught up with the US in the field of AI and is poised to surpass it. While China may lag on basic research, it has the formula to excel in implementation. I hope you find Kaifu as interesting as I did.</p>]]></description>
