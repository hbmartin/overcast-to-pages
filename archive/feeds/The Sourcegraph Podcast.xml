  <description><![CDATA[The Sourcegraph Podcast is a new show about developer tools and their creators. It can sometimes feel like a full-time job just staying on top of the latest libraries, frameworks, plugins, extensions, CLI tools, and developer apps. We want to help you do that, by giving you a window into the minds of some of the best and brightest people working at the forefront of developer productivity. You'll hear from dev tool company founders, open-source authors, and developer efficiency leaders inside some of the best engineering organizations. Our guests share war stories, origin stories, worldviews, histories, prognostications, and the tools and technologies they're most excited about today. If you're a programmer who is passionate about leveling up your own productivity or perhaps an aspiring dev tool creator yourself, this podcast is for you.]]></description>
