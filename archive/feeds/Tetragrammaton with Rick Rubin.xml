      <title>André 3000</title>
      <description>André Benjamin, popularly known as André 3000, is a rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, and actor best known as one half of the Southern hip hop duo Outkast. Described by Rolling Stone as “one of the genre’s most gifted lyricists,” André helped redefine Southern rap with classic albums like ATLiens, Aquemini, Stankonia, and the Grammy-winning Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, producing hits such as “Ms. Jackson” and “Hey Ya!” Beyond Outkast, he has contributed to music as a producer and collaborator with artists including Aretha Franklin, John Legend, and Frank Ocean, while also acting in films including Four Brothers and portraying Jimi Hendrix in Jimi: All Is by My Side. In 2023, André released his ambient flute album New Blue Sun, earning three Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, Best Alternative Jazz Album, and Best Instrumental Composition. This year, André released his album 7 Piano Sketches, a short, intimate collection of mostly improvised piano pieces that showcases the artist’s continued exploration of instrumental music beyond his hip hop roots.

This year, André released his album <a href="https://andre3000.lnk.to/7pianosketches%20https://andre3000.lnk.to/7pianosketches"><u>7 Piano Sketches</u></a>, a short, intimate collection of mostly improvised piano pieces that showcases the artist’s continued exploration of instrumental music beyond his hip hop roots.</p>

      <title>Richard Prince</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Richard Prince is one of the most influential, important, and controversial fine artists on the planet. Renowned for pioneering appropriation art, his “Untitled (Cowboy)” series of rephotographed Marlboro ads includes a piece that sold for $3.7 million, ranking among the most expensive photographs ever auctioned. In 2021, his “Runaway Nurse” painting sold at auction for an astonishing $12.1 million. In 2007, the Guggenheim Museum hosted “Richard Prince: Spiritual America,” a comprehensive retrospective of his work. Richard’s methods challenge traditional notions of authorship and originality.

      <title>Mike Love</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Mike Love is a singer, songwriter, and co-founder of the Beach Boys. In 1961, Love, alongside his cousins Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, and their friend Al Jardine, defined the California sound of the 1960s as the Beach Boys, co-writing hits including “Good Vibrations,” “California Girls,” and “Fun, Fun, Fun,” while weaving the themes of youth, surfing, and romance into their songs. He was one of the band’s vocalists and lyricists for the entire career of the Beach Boys; Love played a crucial role in the group’s vocal arrangements, adding a popular doo-wop sound and R&amp;B influences. An inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he went on to revamp the Beach Boys in 2011, announcing the band’s 50th Anniversary Tour, release five solo albums, and publish an autobiography titled Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy.

An inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he went on to revamp the Beach Boys in 2011, announcing the band’s 50th Anniversary Tour, release five solo albums, and publish an autobiography titled Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy.

      <title>Pharrell Williams</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Pharrell Williams is a Grammy-winning songwriter, producer, and performer. Getting his start in music alongside Chad Hugo as the production duo known as The Neptunes in 1992, Pharrell has produced chart-topping hits for artists including Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and Snoop Dogg. He has co-composed the music for the Despicable Me film franchise, including hit “Happy,” which became the best-selling song of 2014 and earned Pharrell an Oscar nomination. Pharrell’s collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé, and Gwen Stefani, alongside his work as a solo artist and frontman for alternative band N.E.R.D., have solidified his reputation as a creative force in the music industry. With 13 Grammy wins and two Oscar nominations, Pharrell continues to progress the sounds of post-new jack swing, R&amp;B and rap, and pop. 

Currently, Pharrell serves as the creative director of Louis Vuitton, and he has recently announced his role as a co-chair for next year’s Met Gala alongside Lewis Hamilton and Anna Wintour.

In October, his animated biopic Piece by Piece, a collaboration with LEGO, premiered alongside its titular song by Pharrell. The film is now available for rent or purchase to enjoy at home. Link here: https://www.focusfeatures.com/piece-by-piece

      <title>Matthew McConaughey</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Matthew McConaughey is an Academy Award-winning actor, producer, author, and professor of film, known for his captivating leading roles and versatility. He has appeared in more than 40 feature films, beginning with his breakout role in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused, that have grossed over $1 billion. While he is most popular for his roles in films including Dallas Buyers Club, Interstellar, Free State of Jones, and the HBO television series True Detective, McConaughey is also the author of Greenlights, his life-changing, #1 New York Times Bestselling memoir that provides an intimate look at his life, career, and personal philosophies. The book has inspired millions of readers through the actor’s unflinching honesty, unconventional wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living with greater satisfaction–and it’s now available in paperback and with exclusive new content. Beyond writing and film, McConaughey, alongside his wife, Camila, founded the Just Keep Livin’ Foundation, a nonprofit organization that empowers high school students to make healthy choices by implementing after school fitness programs across 19 cities in the United States. 

From November 16-17, McConaughey will be headlining the 2024 Texas Book Festival in Austin, Texas. Joined by authors including Malcolm Gladwell, Naomi Shihab Nye, and Ernest Cline, he will showcase his memoir and celebrate the culture of literacy, ideas, and imagination with readers.

      <title>Joaquin Phoenix</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Joaquin Phoenix is widely regarded as one of the best actors of his generation, known for his intense and eccentric on-screen portrayals in period dramas, thrillers, and psychological films. He was raised among siblings who were largely involved in acting, including his late brother, River Phoenix, alongside whom he began his acting career in the 1980s. He made his big-screen debut in SpaceCamp (1986), and he earned his first starring role in the Cold War drama Russkies (1987). Phoenix is known for his commitment to embody each of his roles, particularly in his role as Arthur Fleck in Todd Phillips’ Joker, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. His filmography includes powerful performances in Gladiator, Her, You Were Never Really Here, Walk the Line–where he won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Johnny Cash–and most recently, Joker: Folie à Deux. In addition to his acting career, Phoenix is an animal rights activist and has taken up producing films like Gunda, and he continues to leave an indelible mark on the world of cinema.

      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Tyler Cowen has long nurtured an obsession with music. It’s one of the few addictions Tyler believes is actually conducive to a fulfilling intellectual life.
In this bonus episode, a year after Tyler walked us through the world of the Avant-Garde, and his favorite pop music, Tyler guides us through some of the major pillars of Russian classical music—from Rimsky-Korsakov to Stravinsky.

      <title>Wes Lang</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Wes Lang is a contemporary artist based in Los Angeles. His work is best recognized through symbols including skulls, horses, and the indigenous American, as he aims to convey themes of freedom, mortality, and the American Dream. Lang draws inspiration from his heroes–fallen country music icons and jazz musicians–to tap into the rugged spirit of post-pop Americana and inspire a sense of opportunity and mythic adventure. Lang’s artistic reach includes creating pieces for Kanye West and the Grateful Dead. Though his main medium is canvas and paper, he has also produced work using cast bronze, collage, fabric, and hotel stationary, with his pieces held in prestigious international collections like the MoMA, Damien Hirst’s Murderme collection, and an upcoming exhibition at Damien Hirst’s Newport Street Gallery. Represented by Almine Rech worldwide and V1 Gallery in Copenhagen, Lang continues to push boundaries with his unique blend of pop culture and existential themes.

      <description>Ben Patrick, known as the “Knees Over Toes Guy,” is the founder, president, and CEO of Athletic Truth Group (ATG) Online Coaching. Though a longtime basketball player in his youth, Patrick’s three knee surgeries by the age of 18 stopped his athletic career short.

He developed ATG Online Coaching, working to restore the quality of life in individuals struggling with knee injuries and bringing out their full physical potential. In addition to building his training system, Patrick has authored three books, Knee Ability Zero, Back Ability Zero, and ATG for Life, and he has gained a massive social media presence with over 2.5 million followers.

      <title>John Sinclair</title>
      <description>This interview with John Sinclair was recorded a few months before he passed away on April 4, 2024. 
John was an icon of the counterculture movement. In the late 1960s, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for marijuana possession, sparking protests and rallies like the John Sinclair Freedom Rally, which featured performances by John Lennon and Stevie Wonder, among others. After a high-profile legal battle that challenged and ultimately reformed harsh marijuana laws, Sinclair was released after two years in prison. Before and after his protested prison sentence, John was a renowned poet, writer, and political activist. He founded the White Panther Party in support of the Black Panthers, produced music festivals, managed the influential rock band MC5, and published and recorded prolifically, including John Sinclair: The Collected Poems and the music-in-verse collection Thelonious: a Book of Monk.

      <title>Dr. Jay Bhattacharya</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a professor of medicine, economics, and health research policy at Stanford University, where he is also the director of Stanford's Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging. After dedicating much of his career to studying the economics of health care, when the COVID-19 crisis began, Dr. Bhattacharya shifted his research focus to the epidemiology of COVID-19, the lethality of COVID-19 infection, and the effectiveness and effects of lockdown policies. This led him to co-author an open letter, The Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated for a lift of restrictions on lower-risk groups to develop herd immunity. He is also the co-author of the widely acclaimed textbook Health Economics, a staple in undergraduate and graduate curricula worldwide. He holds four degrees from Stanford: a BA, an AM, an MD, and a PhD in economics.

      <title>Michael Richards</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Michael Richards is a multiple Emmy and SAG Award-winning actor best known for playing the iconic character Cosmo Kramer on the classic sitcom Seinfeld. After cutting his teeth on the Los Angeles comedy circuit alongside legends like Robin Williams, Sam Kinison, and Andy Kaufman, Richards landed minor film and TV roles throughout the 1980s, including the cultish late-night sketch comedy show Fridays and Weird Al Yankovic’s oddball comedy UHF, before exploding into pop cultural consciousness as Seinfeld’s Kramer. Richards’ latest project, his newly published book Entrances and Exits, provides an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at the highs and lows of his career, from his unconventional upbringing by his schizophrenic grandmother and single mother to his training as a theater actor and honing comedic instincts on stage, his time in the army during Vietnam, and his big break. With candor and humor, Richards chronicles how his private life and curiosity shaped his comedic talents, culminating in his Kramer fame before a health scare intensified a spiritual quest informing and inspiring his insightful memoir.

      <description>Robert Downey Jr. is an actor and producer whose critically acclaimed performance as Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer earned him an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award. His newest project, The Sympathizer, an HBO miniseries based on the 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, has Downey Jr. taking on multiple roles simultaneously.

Born into a family of filmmakers, Downey Jr. began acting as a child actor in his father's independent films, then entered mainstream Hollywood in the 1980s.

      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Tom O'Neill is an award-winning investigative journalist and entertainment reporter. His book, Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties, is the culmination of a 20-year investigation, which unearthed information about the murders, the murderers, the prosecutors who tried them, and the complex web of connections between Charles Manson, the CIA's MKUltra program, the counterculture movement, and other powerful individuals during the 1960s. His investigative stories, such as the cut-throat battles among daytime talk-show producers (“Welcome to the Jungle”), the stalking and murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer (“Dangerous Minds”), and the unsolved slaying of a Hollywood starlet (“The Life and Death of Miss Hollywood”) have appeared in national publications like Us, Premiere, New York, The Village Voice, and Details. His exposé on sexism at Saturday Night Live (“The Incredible Shrinking Women of Saturday Night Live”) earned him an Exceptional Merit Media Award from the National Women's Political Caucus and Radcliffe College in 1995.

His investigative stories, such as the cut-throat battles among daytime talk-show producers (“Welcome to the Jungle”), the stalking and murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer (“Dangerous Minds”), and the unsolved slaying of a Hollywood starlet (“The Life and Death of Miss Hollywood”) have appeared in national publications like Us, Premiere, New York, The Village Voice, and Details. His exposé on sexism at Saturday Night Live (“The Incredible Shrinking Women of Saturday Night Live”) earned him an Exceptional Merit Media Award from the National Women's Political Caucus and Radcliffe College in 1995.

      <title>Serj Tankian</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Serj Tankian is a Grammy-award-winning artist best known for being the frontman of System Of A Down. His powerful vocals and thought-provoking lyrics helped the group achieve wild success, including over 40 million records sold worldwide, multiple platinum albums, more than a billion YouTube plays, and multiple Grammy nominations (winning Best Hard Rock Performance in 2006 for "B.Y.O.B."). Beyond System Of A Down, Tankian has released five solo albums (Elect the Dead, Imperfect Harmonies, Harakiri, Orca, Jazz-Iz-Christ, and Elasticity), composed music for film and television (Body of Lies, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters, Crime Scene: The Texas Killing Fields, among many more), and been a prominent activist for human rights, environmental issues, and causes related to his Armenian heritage (In 2011, he was awarded the Armenian Prime Minister's Medal for his significant contributions to the international recognition of the Armenian Genocide). His book Down with the System: A Memoir (of Sorts)—which shares his extraordinary life story, from his childhood in war-torn Beirut and his family’s move to Los Angeles, to his decision to pursue music and his rise to fame as the lead singer of System—is out now!

      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Golden Harper is a lifelong runner, biomechanics expert, and the creator &amp; founder of Altra Footwear &amp; P.R. Gear. He ran his first marathon at age 10 (3:08:05) and holds the world’s best for a 12-year-old in the marathon at 2:45:34. After growing up working in his family’s running store (which he now co-owns), he studied Exercise Science (with a focus on running technique/injuries &amp; foot pathologies) at BYU and BYU-Hawaii, where he was an All-American Cross-Country runner.

He ultimately concluded that modern medicine lacked a deep understanding of how humans function in relation to the natural world. Kruse lost 150 lbs. using his newly acquired understanding. He is CEO of Kruse Longevity Center, a health and wellness company dedicated to helping patients avoid the healthcare burdens typically encountered with age.

Bill Gifford is coauthor, with Peter Attia, of Outlive, a current New York Times bestseller. He is a veteran journalist and editor who has written extensively on science, sports, and fitness for Wired, Businessweek, Men's Health, Men's Journal, Slate, and The New Republic. He is also the author of books like Ledyard: In Search of the First American Explorer and Spring Chicken: Stay Young Forever (or Die Trying).

      <title>Eugene Jarecki</title>
      <description>Eugene Jarecki is an Emmy and Peabody award-winning director of dramatic and documentary subjects. He has won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival twice — for Why We Fight in 2005 and The House I Live In in 2012. His other films include the Emmy-Award Winning Reagan, The Trials of Henry Kissinger, Freakonomics, and The Cyclist. In 2010, Jarecki’s online video, Move Your Money, spurred a nationwide initiative to support local banks over larger institutions. As the founder of The Eisenhower Project, Jarecki aims to demystify U.S. foreign and defense policies, a mission furthered by his book The American Way of War. His most recent film, The King—which explores the complex legacy of Elvis Presley against the backdrop of American society—was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music film of the Year and 2 News and Documentary Emmys, including Best Documentary.

      <title>Tim DeLaughter of The Polyphonic Spree</title>
      <description>Tim DeLaughter is an Emmy nominated singer, songwriter, performer, and producer of the musical group The Polyphonic Spree.

Formed in 2000 following a period of heartbreak, confusion, and uncertainty as his original band Tripping Daisy fell apart in 1999, Tim started over again. Accompanied by 23 other collaborators, draped in robes, and drunk on the natural exuberance of a new chapter, he introduced The Polyphonic Spree with the now-classic 2002 debut, The Beginning Stages of… The signature “Light &amp; Day/ Reach for the Sun” surged through popular culture for two decades, appearing everywhere from the Academy Award-winning 2004 classic Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to a 2017 episode of Girlboss. 

Along the way, the band released several albums, including Together We’re Heavy (2004), The Fragile Army (2007), Yes It’s True (2013), and Psychphonic (2014). And in 2023, they embark on their next season with their full-length offering, Salvage Enterprise.

      <title>​​Steven Pressfield</title>
      <description>​​Steven Pressfield wrote for 27 years before publishing his first book, the novel The Legend of Bagger Vance. His relentless pursuit of a writing career led him through a diverse array of experiences. Along the way, he held 21 different jobs in eleven states, embracing roles such as a schoolteacher, tractor-trailer driver, and advertising professional. His stint as a screenwriter in Hollywood allowed him to immerse himself in storytelling from a cinematic perspective, which later influenced his approach to writing novels and non-fiction works, such as Gates of Fire, A Man At Arms, and The War of Art.

      <title>Nick Cave</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Nick Cave is a musician, songwriter, author, and actor, best known as the frontman of the band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, though is also beloved for his early group, The Birthday Party. Albums from The Boatman's Call (1997) to Skeleton Tree (2016) showcase Cave’s ability to craft emotionally charged and intellectually stimulating compositions filled with hauntingly poetic lyrics. Beyond music, Cave’s authored several books, including Faith, Hope and Carnage (2023), And the Ass Saw the Angel (1989) and Stranger Than Kindness (2021). His collaborations with director John Hillcoat on movies like The Proposition (2005) and Lawless (2012) have received critical acclaim. And he maintains an open and engaging dialogue with his fans through his newsletter, The Red Hand Files.

This podcast was recorded the day after the conclusion of Caves’s duo tour with Radiohead’s bassist, Colin Greenwood, in Los Angeles. A few days after recording this podcast, he used The Red Hand Files to write the following message to his fans:

“After I stepped off stage at the final show, I changed from my grey suit into a blue suit, ate some seafood with Colin, and then headed to the aftershow, where I hung out with some old friends for an hour or so before going back to the hotel with Susie. We stayed up for a few hours and then tried to sleep, but I was hyped up, so I took a sleeping pill at 4 am — which was a dumb idea because I had an interview that morning with Rick Rubin for his podcast. Anyway, when I woke up, I put on a grey suit, jumped into the car with my driver to go to Malibu, did Rick’s podcast (which could turn out quite interesting as I’m not sure the sleeping pill had completely worn off), then started back to L.A. In the car, I began to feel a bit rough, so we parked up at Zuma Beach, where I threw off my clothes and jumped into the sea in an unsuccessful attempt to restore myself; then we carried on to the hotel, where I changed from my grey suit into a blue suit before heading to Book Soup for [a] signing . . . After the signing, I returned to the hotel feeling tired and weird, sat up with Susie for a while, went to bed, woke up about 2 am, threw up in the sink and collapsed unconscious on the bathroom floor. Susie found me there and hauled me back onto the bed; my assistant was called to the hotel, some extremely handsome emergency paramedics turned up, a lovely nurse arrived and fixed me to a drip, and later, I spoke to an eighty-nine-year-old saint of a doctor who diagnosed an acute gastro event.”

      <title>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Jack Kruse</title>
      <description>Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Dr. Jack Kruse join Tetragrammaton to talk about water pollution, corruption vs. capitalism, spirituality, running for office, the privatization of natural resources, the death of Robert’s uncle John F. Kennedy, the history of SV-40, the medical industrial complex, the Monsanto trial, the chronic disease epidemic, and some of the things Robert would do as President. 

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an environmental attorney, activist, founder of the Children’s Health Defense, the author of The Real Anthony Fauci (All proceeds of his book go to the Children’s Health Defense), and a 2024 candidate for the office of The President of the United States.

Dr. Jack Kruse is a neurosurgeon who had an awakening in 2007 when he suffered a torn meniscus in his knee at 6’2”, 357 lbs. This led to his further study of physics, light, magnetism, and electricity. He ultimately concluded that modern medicine lacked a deep understanding of how humans function in relation to the natural world. He published his first book titled Epi-Paleo Rx: The Prescription for Disease Reversal and Optimal Health in 2013. In addition to being a neurosurgeon and author, Kruse is CEO of Kruse Longevity Center, a health and wellness company dedicated to helping patients avoid the healthcare burdens typically encountered with age.

      <title>Jamie Byng</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Jamie Byng is the CEO and publisher of the independent publishing firm Canongate Books.
When Canongate was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1994, Byng, then in his mid-20s, bought it with a business partner. His first move in overhauling the company's image was to establish the ultra-hip Payback and Rebel Inc. imprints, dedicated to championing cult authors. Over a series of years, the publisher became a radical underdog success story not only publishing wonderful books by Miranda July and The Mighty Boosh but also two books by an, at the time, little-known Senator in Barack Obama—Dreams From My Father and The Audacity of Hope. Jamie continues to be a maverick and taste-maker in the industry, taking chances on bold titles and authors and navigating an industry with an ever-consolidating base of power.

      <title>Arnold Schwarzenegger</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Arnold Schwarzenegger is the former governor of California, a bodybuilder, actor, businessman, philanthropist, and bestselling author.
Moving from a small village in Austria to America, Schwarzenegger set out to conquer anything he could dream of. From his time as the world’s greatest bodybuilder, Hollywood’s leading action star, and the highest elected official in California, one mantra imparted by his dad helped him accomplish it all: “Be useful.” He distills the principles that lead him to the pinnacles of success across multiple disciplines, including the mantra, in his new book: Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life.

      <title>Carnivore Aurelius</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Carnivore Aurelius is the pseudonym used by an independent health researcher. He’s found his life’s purpose in this research and also in sharing what he’s learned with his growing online audience across social media. Carnivore Aurelius is dedicated to becoming his healthiest and happiest self, using the tools endowed to us by nature, and isn’t afraid to buck conventional medical wisdom in the process.
After a lifetime of suffering from health conditions ranging from skin issues to recurrent sinus infections and rheumatoid arthritis, he ultimately realized that the modern medical system wasn’t equipped to help him holistically, only focusing on suppressing symptoms with drugs instead of addressing root causes.
What he’s found on this journey to health is a great belief in alternative healing modalities: finding great relief, initially through the carnivore diet and later with the addition of sunlight, breathwork, grounding, and detoxification. He’s now his own doctor, having become versed in biochemistry and nutrition sciences, and intends to inspire others to take back control of their own health and happiness.

      <title>Ian Rogers</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Beginning with being the webmaster for the Beastie Boys in the early 1990s, Ian Rogers’ career took off and helped forge the digital music landscape as we know it today.
In 2003, Rogers was plucked to head up Yahoo’s $140 million music service and spent the next twenty years bringing digital music to the mainstream—after Yahoo, with Beats and then Apple. In 2015, he helped launch Apple Music and Beats 1, their digital streaming channel. Soon after, he stunned the tech world when he left Apple to become the Chief Digital Officer at LVMH, working with a portfolio of nearly one hundred brands across luxury, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Sephora, and Hennessy.
After five years at LVMH, Ian made another interesting career shift, joining the crypto security firm Ledger, where he is currently the CEO.

      <itunes:summary>Beginning with being the webmaster for the Beastie Boys in the early 1990s, Ian Rogers’ career took off and helped forge the digital music landscape as we know it today.
In 2003, Rogers was plucked to head up Yahoo’s $140 million music service and spent the next twenty years bringing digital music to the mainstream—after Yahoo, with Beats and then Apple. In 2015, he helped launch Apple Music and Beats 1, their digital streaming channel. Soon after, he stunned the tech world when he left Apple to become the Chief Digital Officer at LVMH, working with a portfolio of nearly one hundred brands across luxury, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Sephora, and Hennessy.
After five years at LVMH, Ian made another interesting career shift, joining the crypto security firm Ledger, where he is currently the CEO.

      <title>Tom Hanks</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Tom Hanks is one of the few actors who has succeeded enormously in just about every part of the silver and small screens: he’s written, directed, and produced; done summer stock theater, sitcoms, blockbuster movies, prestige TV, Broadway, and worked more than credibly in both drama and comedy. For his roles in movies like Big, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Cast Away, and Saving Private Ryan—that saw him paired with visionary directors like Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, and Robert Zemeckis—Hanks is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation.
His films have grossed more than $4.9 billion in North America and more than $9.96 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors ever.
Hanks has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor five times and has received numerous other awards, including Golden Globe Awards, BAFTAs, and Emmy Awards.
He’s also written two books: 2018’s Uncommon Type, a book of short stories centered around typewriters, an item Hanks has long collected, and 2023’s The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece, his first novel that finds him writing about the industry he’s worked in his entire adult life.

      <title>Rory Sutherland</title>
      <link>https://tetragrammaton.com/</link>
      <description>Rory Sutherland is a British advertising executive, author, and marketing visionary. He’s the UK Vice Chairman of Ogilvy, one of the world's largest and most renowned ad firms. Mad Men is largely inspired by the company and one of the firm’s founders, David Ogilvy.
Rory started Ogilvy’s behavioral science practice, pioneering the application of behavioral economics and evolutionary psychology to marketing and advertising.
Some of his counterintuitive theories on marketing and human behavior are compiled in his book Alchemy: The Power of Ideas That Don't Make Sense, where, primarily, he argues that great marketing ideas are often built around a core that is profoundly irrational.

https://jackkruse.com
Dr. Jack Kruse is a neurosurgeon who had an awakening in 2007 when he suffered a torn meniscus in his knee at 6’2”, 357 lbs. This led to his further study of physics, light, magnetism, and electricity.

Kruse has written extensively on the Paleo diet and the brain-gut connection. In addition to being a neurosurgeon and author, Kruse is CEO of Kruse Longevity Center, a health and wellness company dedicated to helping patients avoid the healthcare burdens we typically encounter as we age.
He published his first book titled Epi-Paleo Rx: The Prescription for Disease Reversal and Optimal Health in 2013. His blog continues to reveal new insights on health exclusive to Kruse’s ongoing research.

      <itunes:summary>Jack Kruse
https://jackkruse.com
Dr. Jack Kruse is a neurosurgeon who had an awakening in 2007 when he suffered a torn meniscus in his knee at 6’2”, 357 lbs. This led to his further study of physics, light, magnetism, and electricity. He ultimately concluded that modern medicine lacked a deep understanding of how humans function in relation to the natural world.
Kruse has written extensively on the Paleo diet and the brain-gut connection. In addition to being a neurosurgeon and author, Kruse is CEO of Kruse Longevity Center, a health and wellness company dedicated to helping patients avoid the healthcare burdens we typically encounter as we age.
He published his first book titled Epi-Paleo Rx: The Prescription for Disease Reversal and Optimal Health in 2013. His blog continues to reveal new insights on health exclusive to Kruse’s ongoing research.

Andrew Huberman
https://hubermanlab.com
Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and the host of The Huberman Lab podcast which discusses science and science-based tools for everyday life. It is one of the most popular podcasts on earth.
Huberman is a tenured professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine.
Huberman’s research on the visual system, neural regeneration, and brain states has been published in top peer-reviewed journals and publications like Nature, Scientific American, and Time.
