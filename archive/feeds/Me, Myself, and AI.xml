      <title>Upcycling and Upskilling With AI: Goodwill's Steve Preston</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/upcycling-and-upskilling-with-ai-goodwills-steve-preston</link>
      <description>Many of us know Goodwill Industries International as a retailer that accepts and resells donated goods. What the average consumer may not know is that the nonprofit takes in over 5 billion pounds of goods each year — and not all of it can be resold. For those unwanted or unviable items, the organization can either look into recycling or upcycling, and with the help of AI, it’s able to efficiently make that determination while also improving its process for sorting and allocating sellable goods for different retail channels.

Additionally, Goodwill helps its workforce with career-development skills. Much of this training has been enhanced with AI. Tune in to this episode to hear directly from Goodwill CEO Steve Preston about how the organization is using technology to fulfill a mission that extends beyond the retail store. Read the episode transcript here. 

Guest bio: 
As president and CEO of Goodwill Industries International, Steven C. Preston leads a network of 153 local Goodwill organizations with a combined revenue of $8.2 billion. In addition to being a secondhand retail leader, Goodwill is a leading nonprofit provider of workforce training and development in North America.

Positioning the organization at the forefront of workforce development has been a top focus for Preston since he joined Goodwill in 2019. He has also forged partnerships with organizations focused on sustainable practices in the secondhand retail marketplace and developed mission-focused marketing efforts to elevate the Goodwill brand.

Previously, Preston served in numerous operational and financial leadership positions in both the public and private sectors. After heading the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration, he led successful turnarounds as the CEO of Oakleaf Global Holdings and Livingston International. He also served as the CFO of Waste Management and ServiceMaster.

        <![CDATA[<p>Many of us know Goodwill Industries International as a retailer that accepts and resells donated goods. What the average consumer may not know is that the nonprofit takes in over 5 billion pounds of goods each year — and not all of it can be resold. For those unwanted or unviable items, the organization can either look into recycling or upcycling, and with the help of AI, it’s able to efficiently make that determination while also improving its process for sorting and allocating sellable goods for different retail channels.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, Goodwill helps its workforce with career-development skills. Much of this training has been enhanced with AI. Tune in to this episode to hear directly from Goodwill CEO Steve Preston about how the organization is using technology to fulfill a mission that extends beyond the retail store.

      <title>Overcoming AI Hallucinations: Truist’s Chandra Kapireddy</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/overcoming-ai-hallucinations-truists-chandra-kapireddy</link>
      <description>In today’s episode, Chandra Kapireddy, head of generative AI, machine learning, and analytics at Truist, delves into the evolving landscape of AI with a particular focus on how GenAI tools reshape the way Truist and similar organizations must navigate model risk management and regulations. GenAI is more versatile than traditional AI, he notes, yet its flexibility introduces new challenges around ensuring model reliability, validating outputs, and making sure that AI-driven decisions don’t lead to unfair or opaque outcomes.
Chandra’s responsible AI approach at Truist is focused on risk mitigation while emphasizing the importance of human oversight in high-stakes decision-making. He points out that while GenAI can vastly improve productivity by handling repetitive or analysis-heavy tasks, it’s essential to properly train employees in order to use the tools effectively and not over-rely on their outputs, especially given their tendency to hallucinate or produce inaccurate results.

      <title>Reskilling the Workforce With AI: Harvard Business School’s Raffaella Sadun</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/reskilling-the-workforce-with-ai</link>
      <description>Harvard Business School professor Raffaella Sadun’s research has historically focused on digital reskilling. Now, rapid technological changes — like AI — are reshaping the nature of work. Raffaella’s research has explored how AI might empower those with intermediate expertise, such as store managers and blue-collar workers, to become more efficient and satisfied in their roles. She shares a bit about her research on today’s episode of &lt;cite&gt;Me, Myself, and AI&lt;/cite&gt; and highlights the potential for AI to improve teamwork and innovation by bridging the gaps between different functional teams. Her experiments show that AI can enhance productivity and output quality, sometimes even substituting for team collaboration, while also improving speed and efficiency in problem-solving tasks. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio:
Raffaella Sadun is the Charles E. Wilson Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, where she cochairs the Project on Managing the Future of Work and is coprincipal investigator of the Digital Reskilling Lab. Her research focuses on managerial and organizational drivers of productivity and growth in corporations and the public sector. She cofounded several large-scale projects to measure management practices and managerial behavior in organizations, such as the World Management Survey, the Executive Time Use Study, and U.S. Census Bureau’s Management and Organizational Practices Survey of hospitals.

      <title>Feed Drop: How AI Will Change Your Job: MIT’s David Autor</title>
      <description>Today’s episode is a bonus drop from our friends over at the MIT CSAIL Alliances podcast. We’ll back in two weeks for Season 11 of Me, Myself, and AI.
David Autor, the Daniel (1972) and Gail Rubinfeld Professor, Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow in MIT’s Department of Economics, says that AI is “not like a calculator where you just punch in the numbers and get the right answer. It’s much harder to figure out how to be effective with it.” Offering unique insights into the future of work in an AI-powered world, Autor explains his biggest worries, the greatest upside scenarios, and how he believes we should be approaching AI as a tool, and addresses how AI will impact jobs like nursing and skilled trades. Read the episode transcript here.
Studies and papers referenced in this conversation: 
AI and Product Innovation
AI and the Gender Gap
Robotics and Nursing Homes

      <title>Tackling Injuries With AI: The NFL's Jeff Miller</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/tackling-injuries-with-ai-the-nfls-jeff-miller</link>
      <description>Jeff Miller moved from a career in government to focus on the health and safety of NFL players. Due to the nature of their sport, they are more prone to injuries, including concussions, than other professional athletes. By leveraging the game’s unique elements, such as the volume of cameras filming on-field activities, the NFL can gather large data sets to track injuries, and then segment their likelihood of occurrence by position and design equipment and update game rules to minimize them.
Jeff joins us to describe how the NFL has partnered with tech companies, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), to expand its technology fluency and implement these solutions. Listen to today’s episode to learn about specific equipment the NFL has produced and rule changes it has implemented to better track and protect its players, as well as one element of the game Jeff believes technology cannot replace. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio
Jeff Miller is the National Football League’s executive vice president overseeing player health and safety. He is also the NFL’s executive vice president of communications, public affairs, and policy. During his tenure, the league has used data, artificial intelligence, and engineering to improve protective equipment, make rule changes, and support independent medical research related to players’ wellness and the rate of concussions.
Before joining the league, Miller spent a decade on Capitol Hill as chief counsel and staff director for the Antitrust and Business Competition Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. He earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School and his bachelor’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania.

      <title>How a 160-Year-Old Startup Uses AI: The Heineken Company’s Ronald den Elzen</title>
      <description>After trying his luck at the stock market, Ronald den Elzen, pursued a career in technology leadership instead. Today, as the chief technology and digital officer of The Heineken Company, he encourages his team to think about the legacy beverage company as a 160-year-old startup with global scale, operating with multiple brands in more than 80 markets. When members of his team can work with agility and less fear of making mistakes, he finds they are more successful at rolling out new technology initiatives.
Heineken uses AI extensively in areas including revenue management, promotional optimization, and logistics, but Ronald believes much value still comes from traditional AI — such as predictive analytics and machine learning models — rather than chasing the latest trends like generative AI (GenAI). Heineken is focused on using these foundational tools to drive tangible. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio:
Ronald den Elzen, chief digital and technology officer at The Heineken Company, has been with the international brewer since 1996. He previously held roles in data and transformation and served as the CEO of Heineken USA. Den Elzen lives in the Netherlands.

      <title>Collective Learning With Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/bonus-episode-collective-learning-with-generative-ai</link>
      <description>Over the past year, we’ve seen generative AI explode. In this episode, we review insights shared with us from five prior guests — from Microsoft, GitHub, Meta, Partnership on AI, and NASA — and consider what’s changed, what’s the same, and what new concerns organizations face. With GenAI tools becoming ubiquitous and democratized, organizations grapple with how to use them at the enterprise level and how to regulate their use for employees. They’re also struggling with openness and transparency in the name of knowledge sharing while protecting competitive advantage.
The balance between openness, competition, and responsible deployment of AI is crucial as AI tools continue to evolve. Read the episode transcript here.

      <itunes:summary>Over the past year, we’ve seen generative AI explode. In this episode, we review insights shared with us from five prior guests — from Microsoft, GitHub, Meta, Partnership on AI, and NASA — and consider what’s changed, what’s the same, and what new concerns organizations face. With GenAI tools becoming ubiquitous and democratized, organizations grapple with how to use them at the enterprise level and how to regulate their use for employees. They’re also struggling with openness and transparency in the name of knowledge sharing while protecting competitive advantage.
The balance between openness, competition, and responsible deployment of AI is crucial as AI tools continue to evolve. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Leveling the Playing Field With AI: Special Olympics's Mary Davis</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/leveling-the-playing-field-with-ai-special-olympicss-mary-davis</link>
      <description>Mary Davis, CEO of Special Olympics, wants the people she represents to “have a seat at the table” as AI evolves. In this episode of the &lt;cite&gt;Me, Myself, and AI&lt;/cite&gt; podcast, Davis talks about her organization’s mission along with the growing role of AI and how it’s crucial to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities — a group often overlooked in tech discussions — are included in AI development. 
Special Olympics helps people with intellectual disabilities through sports, education, and leadership programs. Its Unified Champion Schools program is an inclusive education initiative that benefits all students, both those with and without intellectual disabilities, reduces bullying, and improves academic performance. 
Mary also shares the results of a study conducted by the Special Olympics and Harvard University citing strong support from parents, teachers, and the athletes themselves to use AI to support people with intellectual disabilities, especially in educational contexts. She sees AI as a powerful tool for “leveling the playing field” and describes specific applications that the Special Olympics is using for employees and athletes. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio:
Mary Davis has been the CEO of Special Olympics since 2016. She joined the nonprofit organization soon after college as a volunteer and coach in her native Ireland. She progressed through various leadership roles before becoming its global CEO: She was CEO of the Special Olympics World Summer Games Dublin 2003, the first such event held outside the United States; CEO of Special Olympics Ireland; and president and managing director of Special Olympics Europe/Eurasia. Davis was awarded a Person of the Year Award for her work on the 2003 World Summer Games and her years of service with Special Olympics Ireland.

      <title>Sharing AI Mistakes: Partnership on AI’s Rebecca Finlay</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/sharing-ai-mistakes-partnership-on-ais-rebecca-finlay</link>
      <description>Rebecca Finlay, CEO of Partnership on AI (PAI), believes that artificial intelligence poses risks — and that organizations should learn from one another and help others avoid the same hazards by disclosing the mistakes they’ve made in implementing the technology.
In this episode, Rebecca discusses the nonprofit’s work supporting the responsible use of AI, including how it’s incorporating global perspectives into its AI governance efforts. She also addresses the complexities of integrating AI into the workforce and the misleading narrative around the inevitability of AI taking over humans’ jobs. She advocates for a proactive approach to adopting the technology instead, where organizations, policy makers, and workers collaborate to that ensure AI enhances jobs rather than eliminating them. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio
Rebecca Finlay is CEO at Partnership on AI (PAI), a global nonprofit that brings together a cross-sector community of over 100 partners in 17 countries to ensure that developments in artificial intelligence advance positive outcomes for people and society. Working at the intersection of technology and society, Finlay has held leadership roles in civil society, research organizations, and industry.
Before joining PAI, she founded global research organization CIFAR’s AI &amp; Society program, one of the first international multi-stakeholder initiatives on the impact of AI in society. Her insights have been featured in books and the media, including the Financial Times, The Guardian, Politico, and Nature Machine Intelligence. She has spoken at venues such as South by Southwest and the U.K. AI Safety Summit.
Finlay is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences and sits on advisory bodies in Canada, France, and the U.S. She holds degrees from McGill University and the University of Cambridge.

      <title>The Risks of Too Much AI: Fortune’s Jeremy Kahn</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-risks-of-too-much-ai-fortunes-jeremy-kahn</link>
      <description>Jeremy Kahn’s investigation into the risks and effects of artificial intelligence are reflected in a new book, Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future. But he has also written extensively about the technology in his role as Fortune magazine’s AI editor. On today’s episode, he joins Sam and Shervin to share the insights on AI that he has gained through his work.
heir conversation explores a range of subjects, including people’s growing reliance on AI technology — specifically, generative AI, whose outputs are difficult, if not impossible, to trace back to a reliable source. They also discuss AI’s effect on critical thinking, how best to educate people about the technology’s risks and limitations, the value of cultivating employees’ adaptability, and how GenAI’s ability to simulate human interactions could be affecting people’s real-life interpersonal skills. Read the episode transcript here.
 Guest bio:
Jeremy Kahn is an award-winning journalist for &lt;cite&gt;Fortune&lt;/cite&gt; magazine, where he covers artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. In addition to writing cover stories and features, he pens Fortune’s weekly “Eye on AI” newsletter and cochairs its Brainstorm AI technology conferences in his role as AI editor. Previously, he wrote about technology, including AI, for Bloomberg. His writing on a range of subjects has also appeared in The New York Times, Newsweek, The Atlantic, Smithsonian magazine, The Boston Globe, The New Republic, and Slate. He has reported from India and much of South Asia, the Ivory Coast, Iraq, Venezuela, and most countries in Western Europe. He is the author of Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2024).

      <title>Never Too Much AI: Upwork's Andrew Rabinovich</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/never-too-much-ai-upworks-andrew-rabinovich</link>
      <description>Andrew Rabinovich began his career in technology working on AI applications for cancer detection. He also spent time at Google, working on early iterations of products like Google Glass. Now at Upwork, as vice president and head of AI and machine learning, Rabinovich and his team are working to enhance the digital labor platform’s capabilities with AI solutions to enable more sophisticated matching of resources to projects.
On today’s episode, Andrew shares his views on the ways AI could take on more complex projects while using fewer resources. In the way of AI’s rapid progress, however, are slow advancements in hardware. While AI has made huge strides in cognition, he says, hardware struggles to match its capabilities, especially in wearable tech and robotics. Still, Andrew envisions a future with hyper-personalized digital assistants for everyone. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Ethically Sourced Creativity: Shutterstock's Alessandra Sala</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/ethically-sourced-creativity-shutterstocks-alessandra-sala</link>
      <description>Alessandra Sala, senior director of data science and AI at Shutterstock, brings an impressive background in responsible AI to her role. Also the global president of Women in AI and cochair of the Women4Ethical AI platform at UNESCO, Alessandra joins this episode to describe how Shutterstock, widely known as a stock photo company, has become a go-to destination for creative assets — and AI training data.
Alessandra outlines Shutterstock’s content acquisition and royalty models, which reward contributors whose assets are used to train third parties’ AI models and have set the standard for other stock media companies. She argues that these ethical approaches aren’t just a moral choice — they offer strategic advantage, given that these assets are integral to shaping the future of AI-generated content. Learn how Alessandra’s team is leading the charge in ethical AI and redefining the creative landscape. Read the episode transcript here.
For more on model collapse — when AI models are trained on AI-generated content — see this recent New York Times article, “When AI’s Output Is a Threat to AI Itself.”

      <title>Meet Your New Teammate, AI: Asana’s Saket Srivastava</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/meet-your-new-teammate-ai-asanas-saket-srivastava/ ‎</link>
      <description>Saket Srivastava, CIO at work management platform Asana, has had technology roles at organizations such as General Electric, IBM, and Fujitsu, moving from back-end IT services positions to more strategic business leadership roles. Asana has already been working with artificial intelligence for several years, Saket notes, and has seen the technology’s role evolve: Rather than simply optimizing tasks, it now often acts as more of a teammate as it’s integrated into core workflows to enhance productivity by taking on cognitive tasks like writing project status updates.
Saket joins this episode to share his observations about the evolution of CIOs from back-end IT managers to front-line business leaders driving innovation and strategy, especially in the context of AI. He also discusses the benefits of being part of a CIO community in which people freely share their knowledge and experience and support one another as they navigate a rapidly evolving tech environment.

      <itunes:summary>Saket Srivastava, CIO at work management platform Asana, has had technology roles at organizations such as General Electric, IBM, and Fujitsu, moving from back-end IT services positions to more strategic business leadership roles. Asana has already been working with artificial intelligence for several years, Saket notes, and has seen the technology’s role evolve: Rather than simply optimizing tasks, it now often acts as more of a teammate as it’s integrated into core workflows to enhance productivity by taking on cognitive tasks like writing project status updates.
Saket joins this episode to share his observations about the evolution of CIOs from back-end IT managers to front-line business leaders driving innovation and strategy, especially in the context of AI. He also discusses the benefits of being part of a CIO community in which people freely share their knowledge and experience and support one another as they navigate a rapidly evolving tech environment.

      <title>Authoring Creativity With AI: Researcher Patrick Hebron</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/authoring-creativity-with-ai-researcher-patrick-hebron</link>
      <description>If you’ve played with Photoshop’s Generative Fill feature or worked in Nvidia’s Omniverse platform, you’ve touched tools that Patrick Hebron’s work has made possible.

      <title>If 10% of the World Were Developers: GitHub’s Mario Rodriguez</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/if-10-of-the-world-were-developers-githubs-mario-rodriguez</link>
      <description>When Mario Rodriguez emigrated from Cuba to the United States at age 14 with his parents — a university professor, and a teacher turned electrical engineer — they had already instilled in him the value of education and a love of learning. That passion has guided him throughout his career — as a program manager with Microsoft; then as part of GitHub, following Microsoft’s 2018 acquisition of the developer platform; and as a cofounder of a charter school in North Carolina. Now, as senior vice president of product at GitHub, Mario oversees the team developing the GitHub Copilot AI-assisted software development tool.
Mario joins this episode to share his views on product development, GitHub Copilot’s effect on productivity and job satisfaction, and a future in which more people can easily develop their own software. Read the episode transcript here.

Guest bio:
Mario Rodriguez leads the GitHub Product team as senior vice president of product. His core identity is that of a learner, and his passion is creating developer tools — so much so that he has spent the past 20 years in leadership roles across Microsoft and GitHub. His most recent work involves overseeing GitHub’s AI strategy and launching and growing the GitHub Copilot product line across thousands of organizations and millions of users.
Rodriguez also cochairs a charter school that he cofounded in an effort to help progress STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education in rural regions of the United States.

        <![CDATA[<p>When Mario Rodriguez emigrated from Cuba to the United States at age 14 with his parents — a university professor, and a teacher turned electrical engineer — they had already instilled in him the value of education and a love of learning. That passion has guided him throughout his career — as a program manager with Microsoft; then as part of GitHub, following Microsoft’s 2018 acquisition of the developer platform; and as a cofounder of a charter school in North Carolina. Now, as senior vice president of product at GitHub, Mario oversees the team developing the GitHub Copilot AI-assisted software development tool.</p><p>Mario joins this episode to share his views on product development, GitHub Copilot’s effect on productivity and job satisfaction, and a future in which more people can easily develop their own software.

His core identity is that of a learner, and his passion is creating developer tools — so much so that he has spent the past 20 years in leadership roles across Microsoft and GitHub. His most recent work involves overseeing GitHub’s AI strategy and launching and growing the GitHub Copilot product line across thousands of organizations and millions of users.</p><p>Rodriguez also cochairs a charter school that he cofounded in an effort to help progress STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education in rural regions of the United States.</p><p><em>Me, Myself, and AI</em> is a collaborative podcast from <em>MIT Sloan Management Review</em> and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh.

      <title>AI Hype and Skepticism: Economist Paul Romer</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/ai-hype-and-skepticism-economist-paul-romer</link>
      <description>Paul Romer once considered himself the most optimistic economist. He rightfully predicted that technology would blow up as an economic driver coming out of the inflation of the 1970s but acknowledges he did not foresee the inequality that technology advances would lead to.
On this episode, Paul shares his views on AI advances and their implications for society. Rather than pave the way for full automation, he is a proponent of keeping humans in the loop and believes that, rather than slowing down technology, it can be pointed in a direction for more meaningful and beneficial use, citing education as an area ripe to benefit from AI.

      <title>Lights, AI, Action: Wonder Dynamics's Tye Sheridan</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/lights-ai-action-wonder-dynamicss-tye-sheridan</link>
      <description>Actor Tye Sheridan may not consider himself a technology expert, but his knowledge of visual effects (VFX) processes led him to cofound AI-driven startup Wonder Dynamics. With the company’s new product, Wonder Studio, creators can upload 2D video and transform it into 3D animations at a fraction of the cost of the motion-capture animation process typically used by Hollywood studios. 
Tye joins this episode to talk about the genesis of his company, plus he shares his views on artificial intelligence’s impact on creativity in the film industry and the opportunities it can offer creators. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio:
Tye Sheridan is an actor and producer who has appeared in a number of films, including &lt;cite&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;X-Men: Apocalypse&lt;/cite&gt;. In 2017, with Nikola Todorovic, he cofounded Wonder Dynamics, a technology company that’s creating AI-powered film production tools. Its proprietary AI software, Wonder Studio, uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automatically animate, light, and compose computer-generated characters in live-action scenes. The company is on a mission to build AI tools that enable creators to produce studio-level visual effects and CGI-heavy content for a significantly lower cost than the traditional motion-capture process.

      <title>Solving Real User Problems With Generative AI: Slack’s Jackie Rocca</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/solving-real-user-problems-with-generative-ai-slacks-jackie-rocca</link>
      <description>Like many product leaders in the technology space, Jackie Rocca took a somewhat circuitous path to that role. After beginning her career in management consulting with Bain, she earned her MBA at Stanford and then worked at Google, where she helped launch YouTube TV. Now, she serves as vice president of product at Slack, where she focuses on the collaboration platform’s Slack AI product.
As a product leader, Jackie had continually heard from users that they were experiencing a common challenge: It was a struggle to keep up with the pace of information and prioritize where to focus their attention and energy. So she looked to AI as a potential source of solutions and is now leading a team that’s focused on launching AI-driven features to address user pain points. The Slack AI team’s work is already helping customers take advantage of the wealth of knowledge within Slack exchanges by providing features such as channel recaps, thread summaries, and the ability to ask questions to surface information that’s embedded within conversations.
On this episode, Jackie describes how her team approaches new product design in the generative AI space and offers up some predictions for what lies ahead. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio
Jackie Rocca is vice president of product at Slack. In that role, she oversees the vision and execution of Slack AI, which brings generative AI natively and securely into the collaboration platform’s user experience. Rocca has delivered on a number of AI initiatives in her five years with the company and is now on a mission to help customers further accelerate their productivity and get even more value out of their conversations, data, and collective knowledge.
Before joining Slack, Rocca spent more than six years as a product manager at Google, where she helped launch and grow YouTube TV.

      <title>Driving Manufacturing Efficiency With AI: Pirelli’s Daniele Petecchi</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/driving-manufacturing-efficiency-with-ai-pirellis-daniele-petecchi</link>
      <description>Daniele Petecchi didn’t realize how complex the process of producing tires was until he joined Pirelli, a company that’s been in the business of manufacturing tires for more than 150 years. But now, as head of data management and AI, he’s focused on leveraging the company’s wealth of data to meet the stringent technical, quality, and performance requirements of the Formula One racers and luxury vehicle makers — like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and BMW — that rely on Pirelli’s premium tires.
In this episode, Daniele explains why virtualization and data are key to managing the complexity of an R&amp;D and production cycle that includes using digital twins to predict how a tire will sound on the road and maximizing efficiency at plants that manufacture millions of tires each year. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Punk Rock, the Peace Movement, and Open-Source AI: The Mozilla Foundation’s Mark Surman</title>
      <link>https://mitsmr.com/3v67I3J</link>
      <description>*New! For a limited time, please take our short listener survey. We value your feedback!*
When Mark Surman produced a pro-peace public service announcement for his local TV station as a self-proclaimed “punk rock kid” in the 1980s, he wasn’t thinking about a future career evangelizing fair, equitable, and trustworthy technology access for everyone. But today, as president of the Mozilla Foundation, he is focused on exactly that.
 Mark went on to study filmmaking and has parlayed his communications expertise into technology leadership roles, where he has continued to work to “change hearts and minds by telling the truth.” On this episode, Mark shares his take on the roles of both big tech and startups in the responsible AI conversation and also describes a recent report on trustworthy AI from the Mozilla Foundation. Read the episode transcript here.
Guest bio:
Mark Surman is president of the Mozilla Foundation, a global nonprofit that does everything from developing the Firefox web browser to advocating for a more open, equitable internet. His current focus is fueling Mozilla’s efforts to invest in responsible tech startups (via Mozilla Ventures) and to create foundational technology for more trustworthy AI (via Mozilla.ai). Before joining Mozilla, Surman spent 15 years leading organizations and projects that promoted the use of the internet and open-source technology for social empowerment.

      <title>AI on Mars: NASA’s Vandi Verma</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/ai-on-mars-nasas-vandi-verma</link>
      <description>When Vandi Verma saw the Spirit and Opportunity rovers land on Mars while she was working toward a Ph.D. in robotics, it set her on a path toward working at NASA in space exploration., Perhaps unsurprisingly, today, as chief engineer for robotic operations at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Vandi sees the biggest opportunities for artificial intelligence in robotics and automation.
She describes the ways in which the Mars rovers rely on AI, including the technology’s use in digital twin simulations that enable JPL scientists at to practice their driving skills before actually controlling the rovers on Mars. She also discusses how NASA’s use of AI — and its approach to risk — offer lessons for organizations that are looking to simulate real-world scenarios here on Earth. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Fueling Interdisciplinary Innovation With AI: Volvo’s Anders Sjögren</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fueling-interdisciplinary-innovation-with-ai-volvos-anders-sjogren</link>
      <description>Starting a career with the ambition of becoming a medical doctor and ending up a technical leader for a major automaker might seem an unlikely path, but for Anders Sjögren, who leads data and AI innovation projects for Volvo Cars, it was a perfect trajectory.

      <title>Protecting Society From AI Harms: Amnesty International’s Matt Mahmoudi and Damini Satija (Part One)</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/protecting-society-from-ai-harms-amnesty-internationals-matt-mahmoudi-and-damini-satija-part-1</link>
      <description>Amnesty International brings together more than 10 million staff members and volunteers worldwide to advocate for social justice. Damini Satija and Matt Mahmoudi work with Amnesty Tech, a division of the human rights organization that focuses on the role of government, Big Tech, and technologies like artificial intelligence in areas like surveillance, discrimination, and bias.
On this episode, Matt and Damini join Sam and Shervin to highlight scenarios in which AI tools can put human rights at risk, such as when governments and public-sector agencies use facial recognition systems to track social activists or algorithms to make automated decisions about public housing access and child welfare. Damini and Matt caution that AI technology cannot fix human problems like bias, discrimination, and inequality; that will take human intervention and changes to public policy. Read the episode transcript here.
For more on what organizations can do to combat the unintended negative consequences arising from the use of automated technologies, tune in to our next episode, Part 2 of our conversation with Matt and Damini, airing September 13, 2023.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.

      <title>Images and Inspiration With AI: Pinterest’s Jeremy King </title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/images-and-inspiration-with-ai-pinterests-jeremy-king</link>
      <description>Jeremy King leads a team of 1,400 passionate engineers working on the continuous improvement of Pinterest’s image-driven platform.

      <title>Learning From and With AI: Duolingo’s Zan Gilani</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/learning-from-and-with-ai-duolingos-zan-gilani</link>
      <description>When Zan Gilani came to the U.S. from Pakistan to complete his undergraduate studies, he chose to study Chinese because it was rumored to be a difficult language. At the time, the tech industry was booming, and he quickly became interested in applying his passion for foreign languages and learning more generally in a technology-rich environment.
Those interests led Zan to Duolingo, where he has been working in product management for eight years and now oversees the app company’s experiential AI team. What excites him about working at the language-learning app company is his ability to help build solutions that enable personalized education at scale: The app boasts over 16 million daily active users, and AI-driven functionality motivates them through frequent notifications, personalizes learning experiences by adjusting the difficulty of questions in practice sessions, and observes and critiques learners’ performance.
Zan joins our podcast to outline the specific ways Duolingo uses AI and machine learning to drive user engagement, and discuss how the technology can be used to support learning more generally. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>The Social Science of AI: Intel’s Elizabeth Anne Watkins</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins</link>
      <description>When Elizabeth Anne Watkins started her doctoral program, she landed a research role studying journalists’ use of security and privacy technologies — but she found the security tools confusing and difficult to use. Today, as a research scientist in the social science of AI at Intel Labs, she advocates for other end users faced with understanding and working with new technologies.
Elizabeth employs social science to understand the concerns of technicians performing complex chip manufacturing processes so that new AI systems will be developed to better serve those human experts. During this process, she also helps the technicians recognize AI’s role as a supporting technology — even a coworker — rather than a human replacement.
She joins this episode to discuss her role as a social scientist working in tech and some of the ways Intel is applying AI technologies like computer vision and natural language processing to improve semiconductor manufacturing processes. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Continuous Learning With AI: Aflac’s Shelia Anderson</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/continuous-learning-with-ai-aflacs-shelia-anderson</link>
      <description>Shelia Anderson parlayed a love of learning into studying the emerging field of engineering when she began her undergraduate education. After gaining experience leading IT teams in the technology, airline, and insurance industries, she joined Aflac in the summer of 2022.
Shelia joins Sam and Shervin to share how using artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the processing of somewhat routine insurance claims frees up staff members to spend more time serving customers and processing more complex, higher-value claims. She also discusses the types of skills she looks for in data science and engineering talent beyond technical capabilities, and why she believes the insurance industry offers a great opportunity for people interested in a career working with AI and machine learning. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Partnerships in AI Drive Conservation Efforts: WWF’s Dave Thau</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/partnerships-in-ai-drive-conservation-efforts-wwfs-dave-thau</link>
      <description>Wildlife conservation efforts may not be the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks about opportunities to use artificial intelligence and machine learning. But Dave Thau, data and technology lead scientist at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), can share myriad examples of how these technologies are helping our planet.
On this episode, Dave joins Sam and Shervin to discuss WWF’s many uses of AI and machine learning. Among them are applications that predict deforestation, analyze images from motion-sensitive cameras to identify species, optimize wildlife patrols to catch poachers, and reduce the illegal wildlife trade online. These conservation efforts are not only supported by nonprofit partners with shared goals but by tech-company partners that are sharing advanced AI technologies. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Making 600 Billion Decisions With AI: Expedia Group’s Rathi Murthy</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-600-billion-decisions-with-ai-expedia-groups-rathi-murthy</link>
      <description>Rathi Murthy has always been passionate about technology roles that allow her to drive business transformation and improve customer experience. In her current role as CTO and president of Product &amp; Technology for Expedia Group, she’s able to do both. One of her key goals is to enhance and unify the end-user experience across Expedia’s many brands, among them Hotels.com, Vrbo, and Travelocity. Another transformation goal: helping to modernize the entire travel industry by making Expedia’s AI technology available to B2B partners throughout the travel ecosystem, such as hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and cruise lines.
Expedia Group’s travel platform processes more than 600 billion AI predictions each year and relies on AI and machine learning technology to provide a range of services, including fraud prevention, customer service through virtual agents, flight price comparisons, and quick and seamless travel booking. Rathi joins Sam and Shervin to explain how Expedia Group is using artificial intelligence to continually improve the customer experience for travelers and travel providers alike.

      <title>A Third Path to Talent Development: Delta’s Michelle McCrackin</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/a-third-path-to-talent-development-deltas-michelle-mccrackin</link>
      <description>Michelle McCrackin, senior manager of analytics learning and development at Delta Air Lines, never imagined that she’d be an analytics leader when she first joined the airline as an HR business partner. But, faced with the challenge of hiring outside analytics talent, she proposed a solution that would change her career path along with the paths of other Delta employees: an internal analytics training program. Delta Analytics Academy (DAA) enables front-line employees to gain in-demand tech skills and the opportunity to advance within the organization. In December 2022, DAA graduated its first cohort of 12 students, selected from a pool of 750 applicants that included gate agents, baggage handlers, flight attendants, and other operational experts interested in learning how data and analytics can be applied to process-improvement challenges. 
In this episode, Michelle joins Sam and Shervin to discuss how the program, started in partnership with Georgia State University, fits into the airline’s talent development and retention strategy. Read the episode transcript here.

Guest bio:
Michelle McCrackin is a strategy and analytics leader with over 13 years of experience in the corporate space. She worked in the consumer packaged goods and automotive industries before moving into the field of aviation, where she is currently senior manager of analytics, learning, and development at Delta Air Lines. McCrackin’s passion for raising the analytics capability across the operations and commercial functions at Delta is exhibited in creation and development of Delta Analytics Academy (DAA), a program with the objective of producing an internal talent pipeline and closing the talent gap within the analytics skill set. DAA was developed in partnership with Georgia State University based on the hypothesis that taking an industry expert and providing them with a wraparound analytics education in a condensed format would produce top-performing analytics professionals.

      <title>Out of the Lab and Into a Product: Microsoft’s Eric Boyd</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/out-of-the-lab-and-into-a-product-microsofts-eric-boyd</link>
      <description>As a partner with OpenAI — the company that recently wowed the tech world and the general public with its DALL-E image generator and ChatGPT chatbot — Microsoft helped to make those generative AI tools possible. But Microsoft has long invested in developing its own artificial intelligence technologies, for internal and external customers alike. And even when AI is not the centerpiece of a specific software program, it’s often driving how that tool — such as the company’s Bing search engine — works.
As corporate vice president of Microsoft’s AI platform, Eric Boyd oversees product and technology teams that build artificial intelligence and machine solutions for the company’s Azure platform and its AI services portfolio. Eric joins Sam and Shervin on this episode to talk about how Microsoft builds AI tools and embeds the technology in its various products, AI’s potential for helping to expand people’s creativity, and the democratization of AI. Read the episode transcript here.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.

      <itunes:summary>As a partner with OpenAI — the company that recently wowed the tech world and the general public with its DALL-E image generator and ChatGPT chatbot — Microsoft helped to make those generative AI tools possible. But Microsoft has long invested in developing its own artificial intelligence technologies, for internal and external customers alike. And even when AI is not the centerpiece of a specific software program, it’s often driving how that tool — such as the company’s Bing search engine — works.
As corporate vice president of Microsoft’s AI platform, Eric Boyd oversees product and technology teams that build artificial intelligence and machine solutions for the company’s Azure platform and its AI services portfolio. Eric joins Sam and Shervin on this episode to talk about how Microsoft builds AI tools and embeds the technology in its various products, AI’s potential for helping to expand people’s creativity, and the democratization of AI. Read the episode transcript here.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.

      <title>Helping Doctors Make Better Decisions With Data: UC Berkeley's Ziad Obermeyer</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/helping-doctors-make-better-decisions-with-data-uc-berkeleys-ziad-obermeyer</link>
      <description>When Ziad Obermeyer was a resident in an emergency medicine program, he found himself lying awake at night worrying about the complex elements of patient diagnoses that physicians could miss. He subsequently found his way to data science and research and has since coauthored numerous papers on algorithmic bias and the use of AI and machine learning in predictive analytics in health care.
 Ziad joins Sam and Shervin to talk about his career trajectory and highlight some of the potentially breakthrough research he has conducted that’s aimed at preventing death from cardiac events, preventing Alzheimer’s disease, and treating other acute and chronic conditions. Read the episode transcript here.

      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/digital-first-physical-second-wayfairs-fiona-tan</link>
      <description>With a background in building enterprise platforms for organizations, including Oracle and Walmart, Wayfair CTO Fiona Tan oversees all of the technology initiatives for the Boston-based e-commerce company. As the home furnishings retailer begins to open brick-and-mortar stores, it’s taking lessons learned from the digital space to inform how it markets its home products to customers in physical locations.
On this episode, Fiona joins Sam and Shervin to discuss how artificial intelligence fuels nearly everything the retailer does, from ad purchasing to product pricing, and where human decision makers fit in. She also describes how AI enables Wayfair’s marketing automation technology, as well as some innovative new programs underway to help customers experience the company’s products virtually.

      <link>https://www.sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/investing-in-the-last-mile-paypals-khatereh-khodavirdi</link>
      <description>Khatereh (KK) Khodavirdi is focused on using AI to create better customer experiences — a process she compares to creating an “AI Legoland,” in which various technology components fit together to build cohesive solutions for PayPal’s customers. This is an approach she is applying in her role as senior director of data science in the online payment systems company’s consumer products division, where she oversees data science teams for PayPal, its peer-to-peer payment app Venmo, and e-commerce coupon-finder Honey.
On this episode, KK joins Sam and Shervin to describe how PayPal’s various consumer products work together to help users have a seamless experience across its products. She also talks about AI’s role in further personalizing the customer experience across the company’s brand portfolio, data governance challenges following corporate acquisitions, and her approach to creating effective teams.

      <title>Keeping Humans in the (Feedback) Loop: Orangetheory Fitness’s Ameen Kazerouni</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/keeping-humans-in-the-feedback-loop-orangetheory-fitnesss-ameen-kazerouni</link>
      <description>Ameen Kazerouni, chief data and analytics officer at Orangetheory Fitness (OTF), believes that AI’s role isn’t to replace human experts but rather to help them make better decisions. That’s why OTF collects heart rate and telemetry data during its in-studio fitness classes: so that AI algorithms can turn that data into feedback that empowers people to make real-time choices about their workouts and enables coaches to offer personalized recommendations.
On this episode, Ameen joins Sam and Shervin to describe how OTF’s data collection and algorithms are used to create a curated fitness experience for its members, and he explains why it’s critical to keep humans in the feedback loop when implementing artificial intelligence. Read the episode transcript here.

Guest bio:
Ameen Kazerouni is chief data and analytics officer at Orangetheory Fitness. Over the course of his career, Kazerouni has had the opportunity to use machine learning in a variety of fields, including clinical research, medical imaging, data warehouse design, e-commerce, and now health and wellness. He is currently focused on the challenges of operationalizing large volumes of data into scalable customer solutions and strategic initiatives.
A core belief of his is to “build experiences, not algorithms,” which drives his team to put forward scalable solutions with measurable impact on real-world use cases. In his free time, Kazerouni enjoys keeping up to date with the latest methods in artificial intelligence and the newest comedy specials on Netflix, burning his savings on expanding his smart home, and marching down the path of becoming bionic by quantifying himself with any and all wearable fitness tech.

      <title>The Three Roles of the Chief Data Officer: ADP’s Jack Berkowitz</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-three-roles-of-the-chief-data-officer-adps-jack-berkowitz</link>
      <description>As chief data officer of payroll and benefits management company ADP, Jack Berkowitz has three primary responsibilities. One is to oversee the organization’s data overall, ensuring that functions like data governance, security, and analytics, are running well. Another is to build ADP’s data products, such as people analytics and benchmark tools. But the responsibility that’s of most interest to our hosts is Jack’s oversight of the organization’s use of artificial intelligence.
In this episode of the podcast, Jack describes how focusing on the outcomes the organization wants to achieve leads to better processes and results. He also dives into the topic of AI ethics and outlines how other organizations might consider assembling an AI ethics board. Read the episode transcript here.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.

      <title>From Data to Wisdom: Novo Nordisk’s Tonia Sideri</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/from-data-to-wisdom-novo-nordisks-tonia-sideri</link>
      <description>Tonia Sideri was a data scientist herself before taking on her role as head of Novo Nordisk’s AI and Analytics Center of Excellence. Now she’s putting her experience to use helping the Danish pharmaceutical company in its quest to develop medicines and delivery systems to treat diabetes and other chronic diseases, such as hemophilia, obesity, and growth disorders.
In a highly regulated industry where failures are costly, Tonia’s philosophy is to fail fast through what she calls “data-to-wisdom sprints.” These two-week hackathons enable her group to rapidly test the feasibility of new product ideas with input from their colleagues on the business side.
Tonia joins this episode to discuss her team’s approach to hypothesis testing, the benefits of incorporating design thinking into building data and AI products, and why she believes empathy is the most important skill a data scientist can have.

      <title>Inventing the Beauty of the Future: L’Oréal’s Stéphane Lannuzel</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/inventing-the-beauty-of-the-future-loreals-stephane-lannuzel</link>
      <description>Stéphane Lannuzel has worked in the beauty industry for 15 years and now directs the Beauty Tech program at L’Oréal. His team uses artificial intelligence to improve customer experience in a variety of ways, including helping them try on cosmetics virtually and providing product recommendations. L’Oréal recently developed TrendSpotter, an AI-based social listening tool that tracks macro-influencer posts and other online content and informs the cosmetics, skin care, and hair products company of upcoming trends that can then inform new product development. Listen to this episode to learn how Stéphane sees AI, and technology more broadly, as a force of good and the enabler of more meaningful professional and customer experiences. Read the episode transcript here.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.

      <title>The Beauty of AI: Estée Lauder's Sowmya Gottipati</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-beauty-of-ai-estee-lauders-sowmya-gottipati</link>
      <description>It might seem like cosmetics and perfume are products shoppers need to try out in person before buying, but artificial intelligence is opening up new avenues for reaching and understanding consumers — as well as new ways to manage supply chains.
In this episode, we learn how Estée Lauder’s Sowmya Gottipati leveraged her earlier technology leadership experience in telecommunications and broadcast media to deploy brand technology projects for a portfolio of cosmetics, fragrances, and skin and hair care product brands. She talks about AI’s role in product development, a virtual try-on tool for lipsticks and foundations, and a fragrance recommendation engine, as well as an application for supply and demand planning. Sowmya also explains why, despite AI’s power, she believes human-machine interaction will always be necessary. Listen to the episode transcript here.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.

      <title>AI in Aerospace: Boeing’s Helen Lee</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/ai-in-aerospace-boeings-helen-lee</link>
      <description>As Boeing China’s regional director of airspace and airport programs, Helen Lee is helping the aerospace giant work toward improving airport and airspace operational efficiency and enhancing flight safety for its aviation customers. In this episode, Helen discusses ongoing research that involves using AI to analyze the wake turbulence of aircraft with computer vision systems, using speech recognition to analyze interactions between pilots and air controllers to minimize the potential for human error, and using image recognition to scan planes for needed repairs. Helen also talks about the challenges of implementing such technology across a complex industry in which there’s no tolerance for error and systems must be impenetrable to hackers. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>From Journalism to Jeans: Levi Strauss &amp; Co.’s Katia Walsh</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/from-journalism-to-jeans-levi-strauss-co-s-katia-walsh</link>
      <description>Katia Walsh began her career as a journalist in her native Bulgaria and is now the global chief strategy and AI officer at retailer Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Over the course of her career, she has developed a passion for three things: the power of information, the power of technology, and the power of machine learning. Her enthusiasm for these subjects is evident as she describes how she is ensuring that a well-known legacy clothing brand remains relevant through technological transformation.
In this episode, Katia explains how she has organized digital transformation and employee engagement at Levi Strauss around five C’s: connections with consumers, commerce, creation, careers, and culture. She also describes the machine learning boot camps the retailer has offered to nontech employees to boost innovation and outlines how the company thinks about responsible AI practices.

She also shares the context behind some recent customer-facing AI tools the company has launched to assist customers through the buying process and free up front-line workers to focus on customer engagement instead of operational tasks.

      <title>AI in the Supply Chain: Cold Chain Technologies’ Ranjeet Banerjee</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/ai-in-the-supply-chain-cold-chain-technologies-ranjeet-banerjee/</link>
      <description>When Ranjeet Banerjee talks about the work his organization, Cold Chain Technologies (CCT), does to transport vaccines and other biologics that must be temperature controlled, he stresses that the company doesn’t solely rely on technology. CCT approaches its work by first considering what problems it’s trying to solve, developing use cases, and then considering whether a technology solution might be the best way forward.
In this episode, we learn how a combination of Ranjeet’s background in chemical engineering, his experience working in the health care space, and a holistic approach to leadership and problem-solving enable him to lead CCT to constantly innovate in the supply chain space. Ranjeet also discusses the benefits of a customer-first mindset and shares insights applicable to leaders in industries beyond health care. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Democratizing Data in Hollywood: Jumpcut’s Kartik Hosanagar</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/democratizing-data-in-hollywood-jumpcuts-kartik-hosanagar/</link>
      <description>Kartik Hosanagar wasn’t your typical Hollywood hopeful. He didn’t pack his life into a sedan, drive to Los Angeles, and work a series of part-time jobs while trying to make it big in the film industry. Kartik is a professor of business and marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School who penned a screenplay while on sabbatical. When he started pitching it to potential producers, he quickly discovered that the film industry can be hesitant to take risks on new writers and directors — which often means that diverse talent is overlooked. So, to help unknown talent to break into the entertainment industry, he got to work founding Jumpcut, a venture-funded startup that aims to uncover new voices.
In the first episode of Season 3 of Me, Myself, and AI, our hosts talk with Kartik about how Jumpcut uses AI to identify creative individuals and help them develop their ideas into studio-ready productions. Read the episode transcript here.

        <![CDATA[<p>Kartik Hosanagar wasn’t your typical Hollywood hopeful. He didn’t pack his life into a sedan, drive to Los Angeles, and work a series of part-time jobs while trying to make it big in the film industry. Kartik is a professor of business and marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School who penned a screenplay while on sabbatical. When he started pitching it to potential producers, he quickly discovered that the film industry can be hesitant to take risks on new writers and directors — which often means that diverse talent is overlooked. So, to help unknown talent to break into the entertainment industry, he got to work founding Jumpcut, a venture-funded startup that aims to uncover new voices.</p><p>In the first episode of Season 3 of <em>Me, Myself, and AI,</em> our hosts talk with Kartik about how Jumpcut uses AI to identify creative individuals and help them develop their ideas into studio-ready productions. Read the episode transcript <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/democratizing-data-in-hollywood-jumpcuts-kartik-hosanagar/">here</a>.</p><p><em>Me, Myself, and AI</em> is a collaborative podcast from<em> MIT Sloan Management Review </em>and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh.

      <title>AI and the COVID-19 Vaccine: Moderna’s Dave Johnson</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/ai-and-the-covid-19-vaccine-modernas-dave-johnson/</link>
      <description>"We tend not to be a company of half measures,” notes Dave Johnson, chief data and artificial intelligence officer at Moderna, “so when we decide we’re going to do something, we’re going to do it.” This characterization certainly seems to fit the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company that made a name for itself in 2020 upon releasing one of the first COVID-19 vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use to combat the coronavirus.
In this bonus episode, Sam and Shervin learn how Moderna used artificial intelligence to speed up development of the vaccine and how the technology has helped to automate other key systems and processes to build efficiencies across the organization. Dave also describes Moderna’s digital-first culture and offers insights around collaboration that can be applied across industries. Read the episode transcript here.
Continue the conversation with us on LinkedIn at https://mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders.
We’ve created a group called AI for Leaders specifically for audience members like you. You can catch up on back episodes of the show, meet show creators and hosts, tell us what you want to hear about in Season 3, and discuss key issues about AI implementation with other like-minded people.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group and is hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Our engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.
Guest bio:
Dave Johnson is chief data and artificial intelligence officer at Moderna, where he is responsible for all enterprise data capabilities, including data engineering, data integration, data science, and software engineering. Johnson earned a doctorate in information physics and has more than 15 years of experience in software engineering and data science. He has spent more than a decade working exclusively in enterprise pharma and biotech companies.

      <title>DIY With AI: The Home Depot's Huiming Qu</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/diy-with-ai-the-home-depots-huiming-qu/</link>
      <description>Huiming Qu didn’t plan to work in data science, a nascent field at the time she was pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science, but one course in data mining changed all of that. She started her career in the research department at IBM, transitioned to a 50-person startup, spent some time in the financial services industry, and today leads data science and machine learning in the marketing and online functions at The Home Depot.
In this episode, Huiming explains the similarities and differences between her previous experiences and her current role, in which she is tasked with helping customers more easily find the products and services they need as they embark on home improvement projects. (And who hasn’t started at least one of those since the COVID-19 pandemic shifted many of us to working from home?) She also outlines some of the challenges of managing a data set of over 2 million product SKUs and getting pilot programs to market quickly, and she explains why she champions the need for cross-functional teams to execute complex technology projects. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Learning, Engagement, and Empowerment: 1-800-Flowers’ Amit Shah</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/learning-engagement-and-empowerment-1-800-flowers-amit-shah/</link>
      <description>1-800-Flowers faces the same cold-start problem any consumer-facing business might face: It doesn’t know exactly what its customers need when they first come to its website. What’s more unique to the platform which operates through a network of local florists and affiliates worldwide, though, is that each time a customer comes to its site, they may have a different end goal in mind. Consumers shop for gifts and floral arrangements for different occasions — as varied as funerals, birthdays, and holidays — which can make it difficult for technology to recommend the best product during a specific online shopping session.
In Season 2, Episode 3, of the Me, Myself, and AI podcast, 1-800-Flowers president Amit Shah explains the company’s unique challenge as a platform business and engagement brand facing this perennial cold-start problem. He also shares his insights into why marketers may have a leg up in working with AI and machine learning, how to foster a team of curious learners, and why it’s important to tolerate failures. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Games, Teams, and Moonshots: Google Cloud’s Will Grannis</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/games-teams-and-moonshots-google-clouds-will-grannis/</link>
      <description>Will Grannis discovered his love for technology playing Tron and Oregon Trail as a child. After attending West Point and The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, he translated his passion for game theory into an aptitude for solving problems for companies, a central component of his role as founder and leader of the Office of the CTO at Google Cloud. Will leads a team of customer-facing technology leaders who, while tasked with bringing machine learning solutions to market, approach their projects with a user-first mindset, ensuring that they first identify the problem to be solved.
Will makes it clear that great ideas don’t only come from the obvious subject-area experts in the room; diverse perspectives, coupled with a codified approach to innovation, lead to the best ideas. The collaboration principles and processes Google Cloud relies on can be applied at other organizations across industries. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Less Algorithm, More Application: Lyft’s Craig Martell</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/less-algorithm-more-application-lyfts-craig-martell/</link>
      <description>Craig Martell says he won the career lottery. After studying logic, philosophy, political science, and political theory, he completed a Ph.D. in computer science and found his way to machine learning, a field he thoroughly enjoys. After spending time at Dropbox and LinkedIn, Craig headed to Lyft, where he runs the LyftML engineering team. He’s also an adjunct professor at Northeastern University in Seattle.
We kick off Season 2 of Me, Myself, and AI discussing a particular trend Craig has seen in the AI and machine learning space: As organizations depend more on technology-driven solutions to solve business problems, algorithms themselves are less important than how they fit into an overall engineering product pipeline and product development road map. Craig shares his thoughts about what this shift means for academic education and cross-functional collaboration in organizations, and the hosts pick his brain about how to combat unconscious bias. Read the episode transcript here.

      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/tech-and-ethics-the-world-economic-forums-kay-firth-butterfield-on-doing-the-right-thing-in-ai/</link>
      <description>Kay Firth-Butterfield was teaching AI, ethics, law, and international relations when a chance meeting on an airplane landed her a job as chief AI ethics officer. In 2017, Kay became head of AI and machine learning at the World Economic Forum, where her team develops tools and on-the-ground programs to improve AI understanding and governance across the globe.
In the final episode of the first season of the Me, Myself, and AI podcast, Kay joins cohosts Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh to discuss the democratization of AI, the values of good governance and ethics in technology, and the importance of having people understand the technology across their organizations — and society. She also weighs in on other themes our hosts have discussed this season, including education, collaboration, and innovation. Read the episode transcript here.
Me, Myself, and AI is a collaborative podcast between MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group, hosted by Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. Its engineer is David Lishansky, and the coordinating producers are Allison Ryder and Sophie Rüdinger.
Guest bio: Kay Firth-Butterfield is head of AI and machine learning and a member of the executive committee of the World Economic Forum. In the United Kingdom, she is a barrister with Doughty Street Chambers and has worked as a mediator, arbitrator, part-time judge, business owner, and professor.

      <title>Fashion Forecasting: Arti Zeighami on Implementing AI at H&amp;M Group</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fashion-forecasting-arti-zeighami-on-implementing-ai-at-hm-group/</link>
      <description>Arti Zeighami’s interest in artificial intelligence started when he read science fiction as a teen. Yet as head of advanced analytics and AI for global retailer H&amp;M Group, his leadership style focuses on reality: first building a business case and a proof of concept, and then undergoing an agile process of iteration and scaling, failure and success, measurement and improvement.
In this episode, Arti talks about weaving AI into the value chain in the fashion industry — specifically around personalization, pricing, merchandising and forecasting. He has coined the term amplified intelligence — where humans and machines work together — and in this episode shares stories and practical tips on how teams can get started and scale successfully. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>Better Together: Mattias Ulbrich on Combining Coffee, Business, and Technology at Porsche</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/better-together-mattias-ulbrich-on-combining-coffee-business-and-technology-at-porsche/</link>
      <description>Mattias Ulbrich has always been interested in new technology. As CIO of Porsche and CEO of Porsche Digital, he runs a subsidiary focused on the “new stuff” — new ideas, new models, and new opportunities. That means implementing innovations in AI, cloud technology, and blockchain in local markets around the world, and instilling a culture of continuous learning within his own cross-functional workforce.
In this episode, Mattias shares examples of how AI is accelerating innovation at Porsche — by enhancing product design and the driving experience, improving production and sustainability efforts, and better managing the global supply chain. He has also connected some unlikely dots from other spaces — for example, by using the sound of an espresso machine to inform car component design. Read the episode transcript here.

      <title>‘The First Day Is the Worst Day’: DHL’s Gina Chung on How AI Improves Over Time</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio-series/me-myself-and-ai/</link>
      <description>As vice president of innovation at logistics company DHL, Gina Chung oversees a 28,000-square-foot innovation facility in Chicago. Fascinated with supply chains since college (“I think it’s something to do with the fact that I’m from New Zealand and grew up in a pretty isolated part of the world,” she explains), she spearheads AI and robotics projects focused on front-line operations — like automated pallet inspection and stacking, delivery route optimization, and aircraft utilization.
Gina notes that “the first day for AI is the worst day”: The technology improves with human input over time, achieving accuracy to a level where people trust and embrace it. She describes how success requires closely collaborating with key stakeholders, integrating change management, bringing teams along when introducing new technology, and designing solutions with the end user in mind.

      <title>This Crazy Wave We’re Riding: Walmart’s Prakhar Mehrotra and the Ups and Downs of AI</title>
      <link>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/this-crazy-wave-were-riding-walmarts-prakhar-mehrotra-on-the-ups-and-downs-of-ai/</link>
      <description>Prakhar Mehrotra, vice president of machine learning at Walmart, shares his experience and how it prepared him to lead an AI team at a $500B retailer. Tasked with using AI to help with decision-making and enhance the business, Prakhar focuses on the technology that improves store merchandising (pricing, inventory management, financial planning).
Before joining Walmart, Prakhar led data scientists and developed stochastic models at Uber and Twitter, where he learned how to move quickly and scale AI. (Fun fact: he even drove for Uber to better understand the driver experience — a perfect example of the role empathy plays in AI.)
Hear Prakhar share stories on rallying and educating teams on AI, the relationship of AI and business intelligence, and what it means to make big bets in an enterprise setting. Read the episode transcript here.

      <description>Slawek Kierner, senior vice president of enterprise data and analytics at Humana, has been immersed in data for as long as he can remember. His fascination with process simulations began on his first PC running MATLAB and Sumulink, and later led him to innovative roles at Procter &amp; Gamble and Nokia. His desire to use data for a noble purpose drove Slawek to Humana, where he leverages AI to solve problems around medication adherence and predict population health outcomes.
Tune in to hear Slawek share stories on recreating synthetic individual profiles indistinguishable from real humans (helping physicians better predict patient admissions and behaviors), and how his team created an internal machine learning platform that gives data scientists access to open source capabilities. All the in pursuit of helping human beings live longer, healthier lives. Read the episode transcript here.
