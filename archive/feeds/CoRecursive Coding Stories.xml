This confidence moved him from remedial to advanced math, sparking a love for programming and education.</p> <p> Frustrated with traditional schooling, Steve dropped out of college to create engaging learning experiences for kids.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From the early days of exploring creative possibilities on a 486 computer in his childhood to developing one of today's most popular web frameworks, Evan You's journey is a tale of passion and innovation.<br />   <br /> Evan started Vue.js while working at Google, just wanting to scratch his own itch for a lightweight JavaScript framework. But soon Vue started to gain a huge following. </p> <p>Eventually Evan then faced a tough dilemma - should he take a leap of faith and devote himself fully to his fledgling open source project?</p> <p>Hear Evan's firsthand story of that key career transition. How the explosive user feedback at Vue conferences gave him confidence.

Get ready for a candid inside look at the creation of a platform that would become an essential part of the developer community and the internet as we know it. </p> <ul> <li><a href="https://corecursive.com/stack-overflow/">Episode Page</a></li> <li><a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://corecursive.com/donate">Support The Show</a></li> <li><a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://corecursive.com/subscribe">Subscribe To The Podcast</a></li> <li><a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://corecursive.com/newsletter">Join The Newsletter</a></li> </ul> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[ How would you build an operating system? <br />  <br />  My answer is I wouldn't. First off, I don't know how. And the second thing is it seems like to large of a task. It took thousands of developers to build Windows XP.  But actually, it is possible to build an operating system from scratch. My guest is doing it. Andreas Kling created SerenityOS starting from an empty Git repository. So today, I find out how he did it, how this is possible. But mainly today, I find out why. Why build an operating system from scratch? And it all started in the 2010s when Andreas worked at Apple.  <div> <p><a href= "https://corecursive.com/serenity-os-with-andreas-kling/">Episode Page</a></p> <p><a href="https://corecursive.com/donate">Support The Show</a></p> <p><a href="https://corecursive.com/subscribe">Subscribe To The Podcast</a></p> <p><a href="https://corecursive.com/newsletter">Join The Newsletter</a></p> </div>]]></description>

It's the story of following that success wherever it leads: From relationships with tech-giants to interesting testing procedures and more.</p> <p><a href= "https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/">Episode Page</a></p> <p><a href="https://corecursive.com/subscribe">Subscribe To Podcast</a></p> <p><a href="https://corecursive.com/newsletter">Newsletter</a></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we try a different format. Adam invites his neighbour, Don McKay, over to ask him questions. An interesting discussion on recursion, corecursion and the naming of the podcast unfolds.</p> <p>"John was saying, we conclude that since modularity is the key to successful programming, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. I think what he means by modularity is okay, we write our fold and it's like three lines long.  Once that exists somewhere, we don't have to have that base case all over our code. We ended up programming a higher declarative level.<br /> The other reason is just I really like clean abstractions.

Where they have started a new project that has a lot of poTech Evangelism with Gabriel Gonzalez tential and they advertise on hacker news hoping that, okay, we're gonna generate a lot of hype, maybe get a lot of influx of new contributors, new contributes, new features, generate more hype and so forth."</p> <p>"They hope that there'll be that virtuous cycle that will get them to the mainstream in practice, that never happens. Usually, the thing about contributors is that their needs are always going to be fragmented, right? If you have eight new contributors, they're going to be taking you in eight different directions. You should focus on one direction and sometimes that means not only doing a lot of work yourself, but it's explicitly saying no to something and saying this is not where I want to take the product right now."</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123"> Crossing the Chasm</a></p> <p><a href="https://dhall-lang.org">Dhall Lang</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.se-radio.net/2019/08/episode-375-gabriel-gonzalez-on-configuration/"> Adam's SE Radio Interview with Gabe</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/">Haskell For All - Gabe's Blog</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

We talk about parsing, the difference between compiler and interpreters and a lot more.</p> <p>If you are wondering why many languages have hand-rolled parser implementations yet much work on build language implementations focuses on parser and tokenizer generators then Bob's insights will be eye-opening. Also, if you've ever used regexes to pull strings apart into structured data, and I sure have, then Bob's perspective on the simplicity of hand-rolled parsers will certainly open up some new possibilities for you.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href= "http://craftinginterpreters.com/">http://craftinginterpreters.com/</a><br />  <a href= "http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/</a><br />  <a href= "http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/">http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Can we make databases faster and remove the need for caching reads in an external cache? Can we make a distributed SQL based relational database that outperforms memcached? Jon Gjengset and the PDOS team at MIT CSAIL have done just that with Noria.</p> <p>Today I talk to Jon about Noria, about building a database in rust and his efforts to teach people intermediate rust via live coding sessions.</p> <p>Jon was great to talk to. He really was able to explain to me how Noria is able to do what it does and where it is in terms of maturity. The key, besides Rust and evmaps, is that Noria uses materialized views to do query optimization ahead of time, on write. The devil is in the details though, of course. And the details, in this case, are turning declarative SQL into a dataflow program that handles cache updates on new writes.</p> <p><a href= "http://corecursive.com/030-rethinking-databases-with-jon-gjengset/"> http://corecursive.com/030-rethinking-databases-with-jon-gjengset/</a></p> <p><strong>Show notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria">Noria Project</a></li> <li><a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/">pdos group at MIT</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href= "https://jon.thesquareplanet.com/papers/login-spring19-noria.pdf">Noria Paper</a></li> <li><a href= "https://jon.thesquareplanet.com/papers/login-spring19-noria.pdf">Noria Article</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset">Jon's Rust Streaming</a></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A decade ago Jamis Buck was not loving his job. He was an important open source contributor. He worked for the hottest trendiest software company at the time, 37 signals, creator of ruby on rails. He was on top of the world but also he was burnt out.</p> <p>Today Jamis talks about how he overcame burn out. </p> <p>We discuss how his struggle lead him to write a book about generating mazes and another about building a ray tracer.

Fibonacci is easy to write as a function but what about fp in the large?</p> <p>Http4s is a web framework written in scala that takes a pure functional approach to building http services.
