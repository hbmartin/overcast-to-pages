      <itunes:summary>Cybersecurity expert and venture capitalist Andy Ellis breaks down why the smartest organizations are using AI to augment their workers, not replace them. Today’s AI systems are best used when they serve as “semi-pro” tools—fast, scalable, surprisingly effective, but still guided by some human oversight. In this conversation, he shares cautionary tales about hallucinations, prompt injections, unintended consequences, and outlines the common pitfalls he already sees companies falling into.

You’ll hear:
- How to minimize resistance and bring the workforce onboard when deploying AI tools.

- Why AI agents should be limited in scope and the advantage of stacking specialized agents which, acting together, enhance productivity and capacity.

- Why AI is good for generating content for specific purposes but not good at creating writing, art, or materials which will have lasting impact.

- How productivity “nag bots” can help workers get more done. 

Ellis sees this moment as the next SaaS-level transformation, arguing that the winners of today’s AI arms race will become the trillionaires of tomorrow. Fundamentally, he believes the best way to implement this transformative new technology is to let humans decide and the AIs act.

      <itunes:summary>Finches, zebras, Darwin... and AI? 🧠🌍

Two centuries after Darwin explored the Galápagos, artificial intelligence is transforming how we study and protect the natural world, rapidly expanding what’s possible in biodiversity and ecology research. In this episode, MIT CSAIL Assistant Professor Sara Beery explains how AI is unlocking new possibilities in conservation, from identifying endangered species to analyzing ecosystem health at scale. AI can help biologists collect, process, and interpret enormous volumes of data, unlocking patterns and offering insights that were simply not possible without modern technology.
Beery shares her journey, from tagging snow leopards in college to leading global research at the intersection of computer vision and ecology. But she sounds a note of caution: AI has no values of its own and must be paired with human values to tackle the complex tradeoffs behind biodiversity decisions. As these tools become more powerful, it’s up to us to decide how they’re used, and what (or who) we prioritize.

🎧 Topics include:
Using AI to analyze millions of wildlife images
Why computer vision is revolutionizing species identification
The ethical dilemmas behind conservation decisions
How researchers are using AI to inform policy and protect ecosystems

      <itunes:summary>What happens when every company becomes a tech company—and the geeks take the wheel?

Renowned economist, bestselling author, and MIT Principal Research Scientist Andrew McAfee unpacks how AI is transforming corporate strategy—from cement makers to software engineers. Drawing on insights from his book The Geek Way and his startup Workhelix, McAfee shares what he’s hearing from executives around the world, where AI is delivering real ROI, and why understanding how we measure impact is just as important as what we measure.

From call centers to material science labs, from spreadsheet power users to the future of education, McAfee examines how generative AI is changing who wins—and how people can avoid getting left behind. He also weighs in on the biggest AI misconceptions, the risks that actually matter, and why Silicon Valley still holds the crown in the age of innovation.

Topics include:
The management playbook of the future
Real-world studies on AI’s impact in the workplace
Why AI helps some workers more than others
The “credibility revolution” in measuring ROI
What companies get wrong about scaling AI
Whether writing—and even coding—will still matter in 10 years

Andrew McAfee is the Co-Director of the IDE and a Principal Research Scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management. His research investigates how information technology changes the way companies perform, organize themselves, and compete. He is a NYT bestselling author and writes a widely read blog, which is at times one of the 10,000 most popular in the world. Prior to joining MIT Sloan, McAfee was a professor at Harvard Business School.

MIT CSAIL Associate Professor Jacob Andreas walks listeners through how LLMs like ChatGPT evolved from academic curiosities to industry-disrupting technologies. 
 
Reflecting on the transformations he has observed in AI research, Professor Andreas discusses how some ideas—like linking NLP research to cognitive science—have taken a backseat, while others—like the importance of large-scale training data—remain central. 
 
He offers insights on AI use cases, the emergence of models like DeepSeek, and the critical role of human oversight in AI deployment. Acknowledging both the excitement and concerns surrounding AI, Professor Andreas believes that educators and industry alike face a challenge in keeping pace with the ‘moving target’ of AI progress.
 
Plus: learn how AI can be used to decode the language of sperm whales!
 
About the guest: Professor Andreas is an MIT EECS Associate Professor and CSAIL PI. Before joining MIT, he earned his PhD at Berkeley. His group's research focuses on three themes: building machine learning models that learn language in human-like ways, enabling the use of language as a general-purpose tool for building intelligent systems, and developing techniques for understanding machine learning models using language. His group envisions a future built around training, explaining, and interacting with intelligent systems for users of all the world's languages.

      <itunes:summary>The MIT CSAIL Alliances Podcast is collaborating with MIT Sloan’s Me, Myself, and AI podcast to share a special bonus episode this month.

Paul Romer once considered himself the most optimistic economist. He rightfully predicted that technology would blow up as an economic driver coming out of the inflation of the 1970s, but acknowledges he did not foresee the inequality that technology advances would lead to.

On this episode of the Me, Myself, and AI podcast, Paul shares his views on AI advances and their implications for society. Rather than pave the way for full automation, he is a proponent of keeping humans in the loop and believes that technology can be pointed in a direction for more meaningful and beneficial use, citing education as an area ripe to benefit from AI.

      <itunes:summary>How AI will Change Your Job with MIT Economics Professor David Autor &amp; The Potential of Self-Supervised Learning with CSAIL PhD Student Sharut Gupta


Host: Kara Miller


Part One: MIT Economics Professor David Autor says that AI is “not like a calculator where you just punch in the numbers and get the right answer. It's much harder to figure out how to be effective with it.” Offering unique insights into the future of work in an AI-powered world, Professor Autor explains his biggest worries, the greatest upside scenarios, and how he believes we should be approaching AI as a tool, and addresses how AI will impact jobs like nursing and skilled trades.


Studies and papers referenced in conversation:

    AI and Product Innovation: https://aidantr.github.io/files/AI_innovation.p
    AI and the Gender Gap: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4759218
    Robotics and Nursing Homes: 

https://www.nber.org/papers/w33116


Part Two: CSAIL PhD student Sharut Gutpa describes how self-supervised learning might bring about truly adaptable models which can respond to fast-changing environments, like consumer preferences.

      <itunes:summary>Have we achieved Artificial General Intelligence? MIT CSAIL Professor Manolis Kellis argues yes. Computers can do nearly every intellectual task that humans are capable of and are rapidly tackling the physical tasks. What does this mean for the future of AI integration, regulation, and development? Hear Professor Kellis’ ideas about how businesses can incorporate LLMs (large language models) to minimize silos, why we shouldn’t put up too many guardrails on AI technology, and how human-AI collaboration can lead to broader societal benefit, including healthcare. Professor Kellis is working toward a future where AI transforms healthcare through a deeper understanding of our individual genetics and targeted treatment development.

      <itunes:summary>This month’s podcast is a double feature. First up, Associate Professor and Chief Health AI Officer at the University of California San Diego Karandeep Singh explains the reality of using artificial intelligence for medicine. Professor Singh extrapolates on what works, what doesn’t, and how some challenges are social rather than technical.
Plus, MIT CSAIL’s Assistant Professor Andreea Bobu explains how large language models are advancing the field of robotics. Thanks to LLMs, giving directions to robots might soon look more like a conversation, without the need for step-by-step commands.
