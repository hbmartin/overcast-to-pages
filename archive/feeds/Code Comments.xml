      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s one thing to talk about your open source principles. It’s another entirely to build them into your workflows. How does a large company like Amazon Web Services actually make it work? David Duncan, Sr Manager Partner Solutions Architect at AWS, explains that being open with partners and customers throughout the development process is key. He talks about ensuring there are no one-way doors, and how collaboration helps to produce a better experience for OpenShift on AWS as well as combining the power of the Cloud Control API with Ansible automation.</p>

      <title>Sandeep Sharma, Tech Mahindra: Rethinking Networks In Telecommunications</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Success in telecommunications relies on bridging the tangible with the intangible. It isn’t just the availability of software, or the speed of a network; It's the blend of network services and physical infrastructure necessary to deliver an end-to-end experience between datacenters and customers. Sandeep Sharma, Vice President of Tech Mahindra, gives us a history of networks, how they’ve changed, and how companies are meeting increasingly complex market demands.</p>

      <title>Ryan Loney, Intel: Bringing Deep Learning to Enterprise Applications</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of publicly available data sets out there. But when it comes to specific enterprise use cases, you’re not necessarily going to be able to find one to train your models. To realize the power of AI/ML in enterprise environments, end users need an inference engine to run on their hardware. Ryan Loney takes us through OpenVINO and Anomalib, open toolkits from Intel that do precisely that. He looks specifically at anomaly detection in use cases as varied as medical imaging and manufacturing.</p><p>Want to read more about Anomalib? Check out the research paper that introduces the deep learning library: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08341" target="_blank"><strong>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08341</strong></a></p>
