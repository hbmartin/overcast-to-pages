      <title>The Middle Class Myth and China‚Äôs Future with Noah Smith</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen, Erik Torenberg and Noah Smith debunk the myth that globalization destroyed America's middle class, showing wages actually grew during hyperglobalization. It examines the limited "China shock" impact and critiques how both political tribes' technology fears may handicap America's competitiveness against China.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:

Main Argument


  
Myth: Globalization hollowed out America's middle class

  
Reality: Middle class moved UP income brackets; wages grew 40% during peak globalization


Real Causes


  
1973 oil shock caused wage stagnation (70s-80s), not globalization

  
China shock (2000s): Only 2M manufacturing jobs lost, limited scope


America vs. China


  
US: Less globalized than most countries; only 4% manufacturing trade deficit

  
China: Cities will look shabby in 30 years; exports falling as % of GDP


Political Technology Paralysis


  
Republicans: Fear hardware (solar, batteries, EVs)

  
Progressives: Fear software (AI, social media)

  Both sides handicapping American tech leadership while China advances</description>

      <title>What If Rome Had Industrialized? | Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen, Erik Torenberg and Samo Burja examine "failed" industrial revolutions throughout history, particularly Rome's sophisticated water-powered manufacturing, standardized production, and steam engine prototypes. The discussion explores how civilizations like Rome and Song Dynasty China achieved industrial-scale commerce and technology before ultimately plateauing or collapsing due to demographic, military, or economic constraints.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:

Roman Industrial Capabilities:


  Extensive use of water power for mills, ironworks, marble cutting, and mining

  Mass production of pottery (53 million amphora estimated from one Roman hill)

  Standardized parts for statues, military equipment, and containers

  Advanced metallurgy producing air pollution detectable in Greenland ice cores


Technological Sophistication:


  Hero of Alexandria created functional steam engines as early experiments

  Romans used coal for heating and had portable fire pumps

  Nanotechnology in glassware (Lycurgus Cup with gold/silver particles)

  Complex mechanical devices and automated systems


Economic Scale:


  Billion+ amphora production across the empire

  Sophisticated consumer economy with middle class purchasing power

  Standardized commerce and shipping networks across Mediterranean

  Industrial-scale mining that reshaped entire landscapes


Why They "Failed":


  Population decline removed growth incentive

  Military pressures from external forces

  Reached saturation point where demand was met

  Industrial revolutions follow S-curves that plateau without continued expansion


Broader Pattern:


  Song Dynasty China faced similar trajectory before nomadic conquests

  Large-scale commerce and state demand were prerequisites

  Water transportation networks enabled industrial development

  All required demographic/geographic growth to sustain technological advancement</description>

      <title>Can Japan Survive Its Demographic Crisis? | Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen is a conversation I had with Samo Burja back in January 2024 on Japan's existential demographic crisis, analyzing how collapsing fertility rates and population aging threaten the nation's economic and geopolitical future. The discussion explores cultural barriers to family formation, automation limitations, and Japan's dilemma between preserving identity versus accepting transformative change.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:

Demographic Crisis


  
Fertility rate collapsed to 1.3 - population shrinking from 125M to 50M this century

  
Aging dependency ratio crushing economy - fewer workers supporting more elderly

  
Young people may emigrate if decline accelerates


Cultural Challenges


  
Work vs. family contradiction - salaryman culture prioritizes career over children

  
Proposed solution: Require executives to have 2+ kids

  
97% ethnic homogeneity creates social cohesion but limits immigration options


Economic Implications


  
Automation needs scale - fewer people makes it less effective

  
Japan's productivity gains vanish when controlling for aging

  
Risk of economic tailspin and brain drain


Military Transformation


  
From pacifist to military power - world-class navy, converting carriers for F-35Bs

  
Nuclear weapons ready - space program + plutonium = "some assembly required"

  Key player in Taiwan scenarios


Geopolitical Positioning


  Economically tied to China, security-wise allied with US

  
Will stay politically independent from China due to nationalism

  
Would go nuclear if US withdraws from East Asia


Japan must choose: Maintain cultural identity and accept economic decline, or transform through immigration to stay economically viable. Currently choosing the former while hoping automation saves them.</description>

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:

Demographic Crisis


  
Fertility rate collapsed to 1.3 - population shrinking from 125M to 50M this century

  
Aging dependency ratio crushing economy - fewer workers supporting more elderly

  
Young people may emigrate if decline accelerates


Cultural Challenges


  
Work vs. family contradiction - salaryman culture prioritizes career over children

  
Proposed solution: Require executives to have 2+ kids

  
97% ethnic homogeneity creates social cohesion but limits immigration options


Economic Implications


  
Automation needs scale - fewer people makes it less effective

  
Japan's productivity gains vanish when controlling for aging

  
Risk of economic tailspin and brain drain


Military Transformation


  
From pacifist to military power - world-class navy, converting carriers for F-35Bs

  
Nuclear weapons ready - space program + plutonium = "some assembly required"

  Key player in Taiwan scenarios


Geopolitical Positioning


  Economically tied to China, security-wise allied with US

  
Will stay politically independent from China due to nationalism

  
Would go nuclear if US withdraws from East Asia


Japan must choose: Maintain cultural identity and accept economic decline, or transform through immigration to stay economically viable. Currently choosing the former while hoping automation saves them.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today on Moment of Zen is a conversation I had with Samo Burja back in January 2024 on Japan's existential demographic crisis, analyzing how collapsing fertility rates and population aging threaten the nation's economic and geopolitical future. The discussion explores cultural barriers to family formation, automation limitations, and Japan's dilemma between preserving identity versus accepting transformative change.</p>

KEY HIGHLIGHTS


  Conflict stems from unresolved partition issues dividing predominantly Muslim and Hindu regions

  India's large Muslim population (200-300 million) creates internal stability concerns during potential conflicts

  Pakistan relies heavily on its military for national cohesion despite ethnic diversity

  Both nations possess modern military capabilities including nuclear weapons (170-200 warheads each)

  Nuclear conflict would likely only occur if Pakistan's government faced collapse or if India pursued regime change

  A nuclear war could cause millions of deaths and create 30-50 million refugees

  China maintains ties with Pakistan and has its own territorial disputes with India

  Likely future: continued sporadic fighting followed by ceasefires rather than full-scale war

  Pakistan's legitimacy relies on opposing India; India sees Pakistan as obstacle to global influence

  Unlike Israel-Palestine, this conflict could theoretically be resolved without existential questions

  India's optimal strategy: economically outgrow Pakistan while maintaining internal security</description>

      <title>The Bureaucracy War: Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar and Senator Mike Lee (UT) - Hill &amp; Valley Forum 2025</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen, we're sharing a conversation ‚Ääabout defense innovation bureaucracy reform recorded at this week's Hill &amp; Valley Forum in Washington D.C.



‚ÄäIn this session, Palantir, CTO Sha Sankar and Senator Mike Lee dissect America's defense innovation paralysis.  They articulate how bureaucratic accretion stifles the necessary competition and "heretical" personalities historically driving breakthroughs. Their prescription: regulatory reset via the REINS Act, competing procurement programs, and empowering maverick leaders‚Äîessential counters to China's accelerating AI capabilities.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:


  Defense innovation has stalled by prioritizing process over people and rigidly following bureaucratic procedures

  Competition between services and programs historically drove breakthroughs but has been lost

  America needs more "heretical" founder-type leaders within defense

  The REINS Act could restore constitutional order by requiring Congress to approve regulations

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:



US-China AI competition:


  The panelists strongly disagree with the Rand Corporation's assessment that China won't produce major AI advances

  Jack Clark emphasized that underestimating China's creativity would be "chronically stupid"

  Alex Wang noted Chinese companies have built some of the best open-source AI models in the world



Regulation approach:


  The panelists generally advocated for minimal regulation that doesn't stifle innovation

  Andrew Ng compared AI to electricity (not a "dual-use" but "multi-use" technology) that shouldn't be over-regulated

  The panel suggested regulating specific applications rather than the foundational technology



National security concerns:


  Alex Wang expressed that the US Department of Defense is using AI too slowly compared to adversaries

  The panelists identified bureaucracy as a major obstacle to the US military adopting AI quickly enough

  They described a "triple whammy" situation: rapidly advancing technology, increasing global conflicts, and risk-seeking leadership in rival nations



Infrastructure needs:


  Jack Clark advocated for US investment in computing infrastructure to maintain leadership

  He mentioned permit reform as surprisingly crucial for AI advancement to build data centers

  The panel discussed the need for the US to compete with Middle Eastern countries' massive AI investments



Future vision (2055):


  Jack Clark: Everyone will have customized education and tutoring

  Alex Wang: Scientific breakthroughs will make sci-fi futures a reality

  Andrew Ng: Intelligence will become cheap and accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy</description>

      <title>The Myth of Automatic Progress | Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Today's episode is a conversation I had with Samo Burja in 2019 about why civilizations collapse, how functional institutions are built, and what makes some societies flourish while others decay. We explore his Great Founder Theory, the myth of egalitarianism, and why exceptional outliers drive innovation more than democratic processes.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:


Societies are artificial constructs built on cornerstone institutions and knowledge that require intentional renewal

Great Founder Theory: exceptional individuals like Steve Jobs create transformative changes that shape institutions

Singapore as an example of successful governance through visionary leadership and long-term thinking

Egalitarianism often functions as a control mechanism rather than a practical reality

Technology inherently drives centralization despite temporary decentralization phases

Future global order likely to be bipolar between US (innovation advantage) and China (different values)

Successful institutions require adaptability to changing circumstances</description>

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:


Societies are artificial constructs built on cornerstone institutions and knowledge that require intentional renewal

Great Founder Theory: exceptional individuals like Steve Jobs create transformative changes that shape institutions

Singapore as an example of successful governance through visionary leadership and long-term thinking

Egalitarianism often functions as a control mechanism rather than a practical reality

Technology inherently drives centralization despite temporary decentralization phases

Future global order likely to be bipolar between US (innovation advantage) and China (different values)

Successful institutions require adaptability to changing circumstances</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today's episode is a conversation I had with Samo Burja in 2019 about why civilizations collapse, how functional institutions are built, and what makes some societies flourish while others decay.

      <title>Ross Douthat on Tech's Religious Awakening, AI, and Transhumanism</title>
      <description>In this episode of Moment of Zen, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat joins Erik Torenberg to discuss his new book "Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious," making the case that institutional religion is not just socially beneficial but intellectually defensible. They discuss the decline of New Atheism, the tension between traditional Christianity and Silicon Valley's techno-optimism within the "New Right" coalition, and whether AI consciousness points to something beyond materialism.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:


Ross explains we're at a cultural inflection point where secularization has plateaued and there's evidence of religious revival.

New atheism has declined as the world hasn't become more reasonable despite becoming less religious.

Ross argues religion is intellectually defensible based on fine-tuning of the universe and the hard problem of consciousness.

He contends that merely appreciating religion's social benefits isn't enough‚Äîgenuine belief is necessary.

The AI discussion explores whether consciousness might exist beyond materialist explanations.

They examine tensions in the "New Right" between tech-optimists and religious traditionalists.</description>

      <title>Will India Become a Global Superpower? | Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and Samo Burja examine India's trajectory as the world's most populous nation, tackling India's surprising demographic decline, delayed industrialization due to bureaucratic inefficiency, and complex relations with China and Pakistan. They explore Modi's nationalist approach, India's digital potential, and how institutional barriers might limit India's rise in a multipolar world order.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:



Demographics: India has surpassed China in population but faces rapid aging with fertility rates already below replacement level.


Economic Development: Industrialization likely within 50 years, not 10; constrained by bureaucracy and regulation rather than demographics.


Reform Needs: Requires anti-corruption efforts, reduced bureaucracy, special economic zones, and infrastructure development.


Geopolitics: Complicated relationships with China (border disputes) and the West; Samo suggests India should be more self-interested in international relations.


Modi's Impact: Promotes nationalism but hasn't effectively addressed bureaucratic problems.


Digital Potential: Has talent for creating domestic tech giants with proper digital protectionism.


Warning: Must avoid nuclear conflict with Pakistan.</description>

<li>
<strong>Reform Needs</strong>: Requires anti-corruption efforts, reduced bureaucracy, special economic zones, and infrastructure development.</li>
<li>
<strong>Geopolitics</strong>: Complicated relationships with China (border disputes) and the West; Samo suggests India should be more self-interested in international relations.</li>

<strong>Modi's Impact</strong>: Promotes nationalism but hasn't effectively addressed bureaucratic problems.</li>

      <title>Cartels vs. State: The Power Struggle in Mexico w/ Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and Samo Burja discuss the complex relationship between Mexican drug cartels and the country's political system. Samo explains how cartels operate not as insurgencies but as business entities with deep connections to Mexican elites. 

The discussion covers the economic impact of drug trafficking, how legalization affects cartel operations, and comparisons with other countries' experiences, and explore potential solutions for Mexico's development and the geopolitical implications for U.S.-Mexico relations.

 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DISCUSSION:



Cartels' Political Integration: Mexican cartels operate not as insurgencies against the state but as partners with government officials, creating a corrupt patronage system.


Economic Impact: While drug trafficking represents a small percentage of Mexico's economy (0.3% of labor force), it provides significant corrupt revenue for political elites.


Evolution of Cartel Operations: Following marijuana legalization in the U.S., cartels shifted from agriculture (growing marijuana/heroin) to chemistry (producing synthetic drugs like fentanyl).


Border Security Concerns: The porous U.S.-Mexico border currently poses limited direct national security threats but could become problematic during escalating tensions with China or Russia.


Development Challenges: Mexico's extractive elites and corrupt political economy hinder genuine industrialization and development.


Potential Solutions: Successfully industrializing Mexico would require defeating extractive elites and eliminating corruption sources, potentially with U.S. or Chinese investment.


Future Outlook: Latin American countries like Mexico might eventually become more peaceful as populations age, similar to countries like Portugal or Greece.</description>

      <title>Inflation, Elon's Competence, and Changes Democrats Need to Make w/ Noah Smith</title>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and economist Noah Smith dissect the Democratic Party's path forward. Smith advocates for fiscal responsibility over progressive rhetoric, refocusing democracy concerns away from voter ID laws toward election integrity, and embracing patriotic messaging instead of identity politics. 

Their exchange ventures into Elon Musk's influence on Republican effectiveness, the merits of Japanese bureaucratic models, and building a more competitive political landscape where both parties can harness entrepreneurial talent to implement practical governance solutions.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE EPISODE
Three Recommendations for Democrats:


Anti-Inflation Strategy: Emphasize fiscally responsible policies, cut deficits, and abandon price controls and MMT rhetoric


Democracy Focus: Focus specifically on election integrity rather than voter ID laws or gerrymandering


Patriotic Messaging: Abandon progressive "America was founded on racism" rhetoric and embrace traditional American values


Tech Leadership Dynamics:

Elon Musk has transformed Republican effectiveness through entrepreneurial approaches

Democrats have alienated tech entrepreneurs through "tech bro" antagonism

Democrats need their own tech-savvy leaders (suggestions included Sam Altman, Marc Benioff, Reid Hoffman)


Biden's Economic Record:

The Inflation Reduction Act was misnamed but had positive industrial policy effects

Biden successfully fought inflation through Fed policy, deficit reduction, and energy production

The administration's effective actions contradicted progressive rhetoric


Project 2025 Critique:

Good intentions but lacks nuanced understanding of government functions

Relies too heavily on right-wing social media ecosystem for information

Would benefit from consulting policy experts at conservative think tanks


Social Media Transformation:

Twitter/X has become narrower and more political under Musk

A more fragmented social media landscape is positive for America

Social platforms naturally polarize along political lines


Alternative Economic Model:

Need for a "third way" beyond neoliberalism

Combine industrial policy, regulatory reforms, and Japanese-style bureaucratic approaches

Emphasize efficient governance over ideological purity


Cultural Observations:

"Situationships" replacing traditional relationships among young people

Free speech principles being abandoned by some Democrats

Increasing education polarization in political alignment</description>

      <itunes:summary>Erik Torenberg and economist Noah Smith dissect the Democratic Party's path forward. Smith advocates for fiscal responsibility over progressive rhetoric, refocusing democracy concerns away from voter ID laws toward election integrity, and embracing patriotic messaging instead of identity politics. 

Their exchange ventures into Elon Musk's influence on Republican effectiveness, the merits of Japanese bureaucratic models, and building a more competitive political landscape where both parties can harness entrepreneurial talent to implement practical governance solutions.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE EPISODE
Three Recommendations for Democrats:


Anti-Inflation Strategy: Emphasize fiscally responsible policies, cut deficits, and abandon price controls and MMT rhetoric


Democracy Focus: Focus specifically on election integrity rather than voter ID laws or gerrymandering


Patriotic Messaging: Abandon progressive "America was founded on racism" rhetoric and embrace traditional American values


Tech Leadership Dynamics:

Elon Musk has transformed Republican effectiveness through entrepreneurial approaches

Democrats have alienated tech entrepreneurs through "tech bro" antagonism

Democrats need their own tech-savvy leaders (suggestions included Sam Altman, Marc Benioff, Reid Hoffman)


Biden's Economic Record:

The Inflation Reduction Act was misnamed but had positive industrial policy effects

Biden successfully fought inflation through Fed policy, deficit reduction, and energy production

The administration's effective actions contradicted progressive rhetoric

      <title>Free Speech in Europe &amp; the Future of Western Civilization | Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and Samo Burja examine the pervasive fascination with American political dynamics and their far-reaching impact worldwide, especially across Western democracies and European nations. They analyze how digital connectivity has accelerated the harmonization of political discourse and cultural values across borders, while exploring the emerging shifts in European political frameworks that increasingly reflect American ideological patterns and media narratives

HIGHLIGHTS

Global Political Influence

US politics heavily impact Western countries, while Americans know little about other nations' political leaders

Western countries form a connected political unit, using only other Western nations as models

Internet's Unifying Effect

Shared digital platforms have synchronized Western attention and culture more than ever before

Younger Europeans increasingly consume political news in English online rather than in local languages

Political &amp; Cultural Transfer

American political concepts (from trans rights to gun advocacy) spread to Europe

Tension between traditional European media control and Silicon Valley's free speech platforms like X.com

Potential European Transformation

Free speech on social media could trigger significant right-wing political shifts in Europe

Upcoming elections may demonstrate the impact of changing information access

Questions about EU's "democratic deficit" and bureaucratic dominance

Western Alignment

Liberal and conservative international movements both center on US terms and platforms

Military strength contributes significantly to America's cultural influence

Western nations function as a de facto alliance despite having no formal "Western Union"</description>

      <title>Victor Davis Hanson Predicts the Future: Trump, China, Russia, &amp; Europe in 2030</title>
      <description>This week, Erik Torenberg is joined by Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, classicist, political commentator, and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Together they conduct a thought experiment: it's 2030, how can we expect to understand the legacy of Donald Trump, the shifting political landscape in Germany and the rest of Europe, the outcome of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, China's ambitions regarding Taiwan, Israel's strategic challenges, and the future of the Democratic Party?

      <title>Mapping the New Right w/ Jon Askonas</title>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and Jon Askonas talk about the emerging political realignment in tech, specifically how Silicon Valley has shifted away from Democrats. They discuss the "tech right," its relationship with MAGA and "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again) movements, potential tensions within this new coalition, and how Democrats might respond to their 2024 electoral defeat.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE EPISODE:

Jon discusses Silicon Valley's shift away from Democrats, pointing to tech leaders like Zuckerberg, Nadella, and Bezos appearing at Trump's inauguration.

The "tech right" is explained as one of three pillars of the new right coalition, alongside MAGA and "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again).

Jon identifies key factors driving tech's rightward shift: frustration with Democratic regulations affecting crypto, AI, and energy production; COVID governance failures; and cultural issues.

The podcast examines potential tensions within this coalition, particularly around immigration and transhumanism, where tech interests may conflict with MAGA priorities.

Jon analyzes how the new right coalition is united by opposition to "the Cathedral" (establishment institutions) rather than external threats.

They discuss Project 2025 and "DOGE" (Department of Government Efficiency) as attempts to dismantle bureaucracy and bring transparency to government spending.

The conversation explores how Democrats might respond, including moderating on culture war issues and adopting an "abundance agenda."</description>

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE EPISODE:

Delian and Nadia met in San Francisco, where Delian quickly pushed for commitment while Nadia was initially intrigued but uncertain about his intense personality.

They built their relationship on minimal but direct communication, believing that over-communication can create problems where none exist.

Their careers grew alongside their relationship, with both valuing some shared context in tech while pursuing different interests.

Having their first child changed their dynamic from independence to necessary schedule coordination, though they work to maintain their individual pursuits.

Delian advocates for men having children younger to grow alongside their careers, while Nadia emphasizes women should have time to find themselves first.

The couple balances ambitious careers with family life, seeing their domestic world as an expanding universe rather than a limitation.

They approach conflicts with a "short memory" philosophy, choosing not to overanalyze small issues and accepting that some days will have tension.</description>

      <title>Samo Burja on the Technology That Can Create New Superpowers</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/moment-of-zen-1/e117-samo-burja-on-the-technology-that-can-create-new-superpowers/</link>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and Samo Burja examine how advancing desalination technology could reshape geopolitics and transform landscapes. They discuss how affordable desalination ($0.3 cents per liter) makes large-scale terraforming feasible, potentially enabling countries like Saudi Arabia or Australia to create vast green spaces and support larger populations. The technology's implications extend beyond water security to national development and climate resilience.

      <title>Curtis Yarvin is now in the Overton Window w/ Samo Burja</title>
      <description>Erik Torenberg and Samo Burja analyze Curtis Yarvin's arguments about government inefficiency, comparing corporate and state governance structures. The conversation covers how bureaucracies decay over time, China's approach to governance, and Yarvin's influence in shifting Silicon Valley libertarians toward more right-wing positions. They also examine his evolution from a cancelled figure to a mainstream intellectual voice.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE EPISODE:

Curtis Yarvin's influence on tech-right thinking challenged conventional political discourse through digital platforms.

Corporate efficiency doesn't follow natural selection principles - institutional success requires active leadership rather than market forces alone.

Government accountability and innovation are stifled by bureaucratic gridlock, with catastrophic potential costs to society (exemplified by China's one-child policy).

Mainstream political ideologies (left &amp; right) are more aligned than they appear, suggesting democracy isn't the final stage of political evolution.

Engaging with controversial thinkers like Yarvin reveals important critiques of current systems, even when disagreeing with their proposed solutions.

Societal progress requires harnessing collective energy and maintaining efficient governance structures.</description>

      <title>Trump's Inauguration, Tech's Shifting Politics, and US GDP Growth Wall</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen, we're bringing you the third episode of "This Won't Last", the newest show from Turpentine.

Keith Rabois, Logan Bartlett, Kevin Ryan, and Zach Weinberg dissect the 2025 political landscape in a spirited discussion of Trump's evolved messaging and surprising tech industry backing. The conversation weaves through immigration policy, corporate political neutrality, and market dynamics - from Silicon Valley's rightward shift to urban crime challenges and insurance markets and explores how America's tech-policy nexus is reshaping in real-time.

HIGHLIGHTS:
Core Agreement Areas:

Both are skeptical of partisan justifications for industrial policy (Democrats' "good jobs" focus and Republicans' "America First" stance)

Both agree liberalization, not industrial policy, drove China's rapid growth


Climate Change &amp; Green Tech:

Sumner argues Biden's green subsidies were undermined by trade barriers against Chinese EVs/solar

Smith counters that China's industrial policy in green tech has actually helped global climate goals by scaling production and reducing costs


Central Point of Disagreement - China Threat:

Sumner sees Russia as the bigger immediate threat and warns against needlessly antagonizing China

Smith argues we've entered a new era where China's manufacturing dominance (especially in military-relevant technologies like drones and batteries) fundamentally threatens democratic nations


Biden vs Trump Policy Results:

Both criticize Trump's tariffs as ineffective

Smith points to success of Biden's CHIPS Act and IRA in boosting domestic manufacturing of critical technologies

Sumner suggests many industrial policies are based on misconceptions about macroeconomics


Manufacturing Strategy:

Sumner advocates addressing trade deficits through fiscal policy and savings rates

Smith emphasizes the need to maintain manufacturing parity in specific dual-use technologies

They differ on whether total manufacturing capacity or specific industrial capabilities matter more for national security</description>

      <title>Can Classical Liberalism Survive Wokeness? w/ Tim Urban</title>
      <description>In this episode of Moment of Zen, Erik Torenberg sits down with Tim Urban, writer of the popular blog Wait But Why, and author of the 2023 book What‚Äôs Our Problem? where he offers a framework for thinking about our chaotic political landscape.
Tim unpacks the clash between freedom and equality in modern society. He explores how social justice movements and political extremes threaten open dialogue. Urban argues for a return to classical liberal values, challenging listeners to consider: Are we fostering true diversity of thought, or silencing dissent in the name of progress?

      <title>Long Ripples in History with Samo Burja and Rudyard Lynch</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen, Samo Burja and Rudyard Lynch return for for a mind-bending discussion and deep dive into the concept of "long ripples" ‚Äî how ideas and events from the distant past continue to shape our present and future in unexpected ways. From Plato's influence on modern political movements to the unforeseen consequences of the Industrial Revolution, this conversation challenges our understanding of historical cause and effect.

Are we truly progressing, or are we caught in cycles we fail to recognize? Can we learn from the past, or are we doomed to repeat it in new, technologically-amplified ways? This episode is a rollercoaster ride through time, technology, and human nature, forcing us to reconsider our place in the grand sweep of history.¬†

Both Samo and Rudyard are hosts of Turpentine shows, Live Players and History 102, respectively.

      <itunes:summary>Today on Moment of Zen, Samo Burja and Rudyard Lynch return for for a mind-bending discussion and deep dive into the concept of "long ripples" ‚Äî how ideas and events from the distant past continue to shape our present and future in unexpected ways. From Plato's influence on modern political movements to the unforeseen consequences of the Industrial Revolution, this conversation challenges our understanding of historical cause and effect.

Are we truly progressing, or are we caught in cycles we fail to recognize? Can we learn from the past, or are we doomed to repeat it in new, technologically-amplified ways? This episode is a rollercoaster ride through time, technology, and human nature, forcing us to reconsider our place in the grand sweep of history.¬†

Both Samo and Rudyard are hosts of Turpentine shows, Live Players and History 102, respectively.

      <title>Cycles of Civilization with Samo Burja and Rudyard Lynch</title>
      <description>Today on Moment of Zen, we're airing a discussion between Samo Burja and Rudyard Lynch - two intellectual heavyweights tackling the idea that civilizations may have inherent differences that can alter our understanding of the course of history and politics.
Both Samo and Rudyard are hosts of Turpentine shows, Live Players and History 102, respectively.
This is a fascinating discussion on threads that bridge Silicon Valley with ancient civilizations like Babylon, the impact of Abrahamic religions, and the idea that societies go through cycles that may upend our current assumptions

      <title>China's Energy Strategy, Taiwan, and US-China Relations with Samo Burja</title>
      <description>In this episode, Samo Burja and Erik Torenberg discuss China's energy strategy and its broader geopolitical implications. Contrary to popular belief, China is not aggressively pursuing energy independence but remains reliant on imports despite significant domestic oil production. The conversation delves into China's geopolitical strategy, its military preparedness, and the potential consequences of a conflict over Taiwan. The episode also explores the broader implications of a potential U.S.-China industrial competition and the risks of a bipolar world.

      <title>2024 Election Strategy, Education Depolarization, and UBI with Noah Smith</title>
      <description>This week, Noah Smith joins Erik Torenberg to discuss America's future. They cover the 2024 presidential race, the Chevron ruling from the Supreme Court, and the polarization of the education system. Noah and Erik also discuss where wokeness goes from here, and the potential outcomes of integrating more conservatives into the civil service through initiatives like Project 2025. Noah also debunks the deep state myth and discusses the real issues surrounding Biden's age, questioning the influence of "political handlers" and the reality of a "deep state."

      <title>David Sacks on his Intellectual and Political journey</title>
      <link>https://www.podpage.com/moment-of-zen-1/e81-david-sacks-on-his-intellectual-and-political-journey/</link>
      <description>David Sacks is known as a CEO/investor in multiple unicorns, and most recently a media mogul with All-In. In this episode, he sits down with Erik Torenberg to trace his intellectual and political history from his days fighting student activism at Stanford to now. We cover the political and cultural changes in the last 30 years of silicon valley, how the real distinction today is between the college-educated and the not, and how even though 2‚ÅÑ3 of the country didn‚Äôt go to college, their views are not represented in our institutions today. This episode was recorded in December 2022 but is just as relevant today.¬†

They discuss media literacy and journalism, how politics change people's views of social media, and the rise of unique religious movements in social activism. This episode marks the first time Erik interviewed Antonio Garcia Martinez on Venture Stories back in 2019 and remains relevant today.

They discuss Peter Thiel's economic, political, and religious ideas and discuss his legacy. They also debate if the left really has lost control of culture or whether we‚Äôre just more siloed in 2023, and which GOP candidates draw on upstream intellectual ideas.

The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses ‚Äì and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows ‚Äì IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors.

      <description>Anonymous founders of the Effective Accelerationist (e/acc) movement @Bayeslord and Beff Jezoz (@BasedBeff) join Erik Torenberg, Dan Romero, and Nathan Labenz to debate views on AI safety.

We're hiring across the board at Turpentine and for Erik's personal team on other projects he's incubating. He's hiring a Chief of Staff, EA, Head of Special Projects, Investment Associate, and more. For a list of JDs, check out: eriktorenberg.com.

RECOMMENDED PODCAST:
The HR industry is at a crossroads. What will it take to construct the next generation of incredible businesses ‚Äì and where can people leaders have the most business impact? Hosts Nolan Church and Kelli Dragovich have been through it all, the highs and the lows ‚Äì IPOs, layoffs, executive turnover, board meetings, culture changes, and more. With a lineup of industry vets and experts, Nolan and Kelli break down the nitty-gritty details, trade offs, and dynamics of constructing high performing companies. Through unfiltered conversations that can only happen between seasoned practitioners, Kelli and Nolan dive deep into the kind of leadership-level strategy that often happens behind closed doors. Check out the first episode with the architect of Netflix‚Äôs culture deck Patty McCord.
