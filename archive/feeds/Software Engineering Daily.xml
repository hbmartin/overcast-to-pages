<p>The Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is a new open standard that connects AI assistants to arbitrary data sources and tools, such as codebases, APIs, and content repositories. Instead of building bespoke integrations for each system, developers can use MCP to establish secure, scalable connections between AI models and the data they need. By standardizing this connection layer, MCP enables models to access relevant information in real time, leading to more accurate and context-aware responses.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>The game was also a technological milestone that redefined what was possible in open-world game design. It was one of the first fully 3D open-world games to offer seamless exploration, blending mission-based gameplay with a living, breathing city.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>The game was originally released on PlayStation 2 and PC but never had an official Sega Dreamcast version. However, the homebrew community embarked on the goal of porting the game to the Dreamcast, and recently released the port to much acclaim.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI tools are transforming how developers write code, and although it’s difficult to pinpoint how much code is now AI-generated code, estimates suggest it’s between 20% and 40%, and this figure is poised to grow in the coming years. This evolution has given rise to a new coding paradigm in which developers act as directors, guiding and refining AI-generated solutions rather than manually writing every line of code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach was recently termed “vibe coding” by Andrej Karpathy, and it shifts the programmer’s role from detailed coding to overseeing and enhancing AI-produced code. It emphasizes collaborative interaction with AI, blending human creativity with machine efficiency to solve complex problems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/vish"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vish Abrams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the Chief Architect at </span><a href="https://www.heroku.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroku</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and previously worked at Oracle and NASA, among other organizations. In this episode, Vish joins the show with Kevin Ball for a wide-ranging conversation about the state of AI-based tools, whether there are limits to vibe coding, AI tools for individuals vs. AI tools for teams, the Model Context Protocol, Heroku’s managed inference service, and much more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern cloud-native systems are highly dynamic and distributed, which makes it difficult to monitor cloud infrastructure using traditional tools designed for static environments. This has motivated the development and widespread adoption of dedicated observability platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prometheus is an open-source observability tool designed for cloud-native environments. Its strong integration with Kubernetes and pull-based data collection model have driven its popularization in DevOps. However, a common challenge with Prometheus is that it struggles with large data volumes and has limited cost-optimization capabilities. This raises the question of how best to handle Prometheus deployments at large scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://x.com/ericschabell">Eric Schabell </a>works in DevRel at <a href="https://chronosphere.io/sed">Chronosphere</a> where he’s the Director of Community and Developer. He is also a CNCF Ambassador. Eric joins the show with Kevin Ball to talk about metrics collection, time series data, managing Prometheus at scale, tradeoffs between self-hosted vs. managed observability, and more.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Agreements and contracts are a fundamental innovation and govern everything from personal commitments to major financial decisions. They function as trusted artifacts to capture the nature of a commitment and provide clarity and accountability. Software has revolutionized many business functions, including the basic mechanics of digitally signing an agreement. However, the process of managing agreements systematically and at scale with type definitions, programmatic document creation, and storage schemas remains a complex and largely unsolved challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://x.com/danielselman">Dan Selman</a> is the product architect at <a href="https://www.docusign.com/">Docusign</a> and was previously co-founder and CTO of the Smart Agreements Platform, Clause. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elj4y/">Larry Jin</a> is the VP of Product Management at Docusign and previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Docusign recently released a developer API focused on fully modernizing and scaling the agreements process. In this episode, Dan and Larry joined Sean Falconer to talk about the frontier of digital agreements.</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Critically, these cables are vulnerable to sabotage by state actors, as they form critical infrastructure for global communication and economic stability. Indeed, Russia and China have been implicated in activities targeting subsea cables as recently as November 2024, and experts warn that these networks are likely to be focal points in future conflicts, heightening geopolitical tensions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">FAPI is a refinement of the OAuth standard developed by the OpenID Foundation. It was conceived to solve a core problem of providing a consistent approach to API security across the financial industry, with the goal of enhancing interoperability of financial data exchange. It has now been adopted across many different industries in applications where there is an API that requires a heightened authorization security implementation.</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>TSMC&#8217;s dominance in chip production has made Taiwan a critical player in the global tech supply chain, drawing attention from major economies like the U.S. and China. This has escalated geopolitical tensions, with concerns over the stability of Taiwan and the potential risks to global tech industries if chip production were disrupted due to regional conflicts.</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Tim has written extensively about TSMC, and recently broke news on the developments at TSMC&#8217;s Arizona factory. He joins us today to discuss what&#8217;s happening at TSMC and what that means for the US, Taiwan and China’s chip industries.</p>

<p>In software engineering, C++ is often used in areas where low-level system access and high-performance are critical, such as operating systems, game engines, and embedded systems. Its long-standing presence and compatibility with legacy code make it a go-to language for maintaining and extending older projects. Rust, while newer, is gaining traction in roles that demand safety and concurrency, particularly in systems programming.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>We wanted to explore these two languages side-by-side, so we invited <a href="https://herbsutter.com/">Herb Sutter</a> and <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> to join host Kevin Ball on the show. Herb works at Microsoft and chairs the ISO <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a> standards committee. Steve works at Oxide Computer Company, is an alumnus of the <a href="https://x.com/rustlang">Rust</a> Core Team, and is the primary author of The Rust Programming Language book.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>We hope you enjoy this deep dive into Rust and C++ on Software Engineering Daily.</p>

<p>CRISPR is a powerful tool in biotechnology that allows scientists to precisely edit genes, much like editing lines of code in a computer program. Just as developers can remove or alter specific parts of a code to fix bugs or enhance functionality, CRISPR enables researchers to modify DNA to correct genetic disorders, improve crops, or develop new treatments. The development of CRISPR-based editing was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.</p>
