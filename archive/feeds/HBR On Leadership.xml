In this episode, David Risher, CEO of Lyft, shares how he’s driving a turnaround at the rideshare company by anchoring everything in customer obsession. Since Risher took the wheel in 2023, Lyft reached record bookings and a 31% increase in annual revenue and its first full year of profitability. Risher shares how his own experience behind the wheel as a Lyft driver informs product innovation. And why listening deeply—whether to a single passenger or a room of drivers—can lead to breakthrough ideas. He also opens up about navigating layoffs, launching inclusive features, and preparing for an autonomous future while keeping human dignity front and center.</description><enclosure url="https://audio.hbr.org/on-leadership/20250610131553-114_Customer-ObsessedInnovation.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="33469083"/><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:audio.hbr.org,2023-4-21:on-leadership.s1.0114</guid><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:duration>00:34:49</itunes:duration><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 06:02:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Building an AI-Powered, Talent-Friendly Organization</title><description>Over the next four weeks, we're highlighting some of the best conversations from the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit held in April. In this episode, Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group, shares her leadership approach to scaling one of the world’s largest online travel companies. From pioneering the use of AI in customer experience and internal operations to reimagining hybrid work and gender diversity, she shares how she's steering a global company through rapid change and geopolitical uncertainty. She discusses her emphasis on hiring for integrity, competence, and curiosity, and outlines how AI is embedded throughout the business—from resume screening and customer personalization to employee training and product development.</description><enclosure url="https://audio.hbr.org/on-leadership/20250603125711-113_BuildinganAI-PoweredTalent-FriendlyOrganization.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="27864403"/><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:audio.hbr.org,2023-4-21:on-leadership.s1.0113</guid><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:duration>00:28:59</itunes:duration><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 06:02:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Don’t Just Coach Your Employees—Teach Them</title><description>Sydney Finkelstein, a professor of management at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, encourages leaders to approach their direct reports like teachers. As Finkelstein explains, being a teacher-leader means continually meeting face to face with employees to communicate lessons about professionalism, points of craft, and life. He says it’s easy to try and that teaching is one of the best ways to motivate people and improve their performance. Finkelstein is the author of “The Best Leaders Are Great Teachers” in the January–February 2018 issue of Harvard Business Review.</description><enclosure url="https://audio.hbr.org/on-leadership/20250527145220-112_DontJustCoachYourEmployeesTeachThem.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="18897919"/><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:audio.hbr.org,2023-4-21:on-leadership.s1.0112</guid><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:duration>00:19:37</itunes:duration><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 06:02:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>How to Resolve Team Conflict</title><description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;People management consists of a fair amount of mediation and diplomacy, and you can’t expect to get the hang of it right away.

Instead, she argues that you should move fast and fix things. (That’s also the topic and title of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Move-Fast-Fix-Things-Problems-ebook/dp/B0BTJB6ZZZ" target="_blank" style="color: blue;"&gt;the book she coauthored with Anne Morriss&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Frei explains how you can solve any problem in five clear steps.

But there’s a catch: your struggling employee is a personal friend of your CEO. When performance review time rolls around, should you be honest and give them a low rating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no simple answers for the tough decisions that managers face. Harvard Business School professor &lt;strong&gt;Joe Badaracco&lt;/strong&gt; says that hard and fast rules only go so far in these sorts of situations.

It was far bigger and more complex than the factory she’d been managing in North Carolina before her promotion. She had to shift from being a more operational, tactical manager to a more strategic role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Fox was also the first Black female manager at the Iowa factory, and her employees there were mostly white men.
