Nick Melvoin)</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>There’s a problem in class today, and the second largest school district in the United States is trying to solve it.</p><p>After looking at the growing body of research that has associated increased smartphone and social media usage with increased levels of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and isolation—especially amongst adolescents and teenagers—Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) implemented a cellphone ban across its 1,000 schools for its more than 500,000 students.</p><p>Under the ban, students who are kindergartners all the way through high school seniors cannot use&nbsp;cellphones, smartphones, smart watches, earbuds, smart glasses, and any other electronic devices that can send messages, receive calls, or browse the internet.&nbsp;Phones are not allowed at lunch or during passing periods between classes, and, under the ban, individual schools decide how students’ phones are stored, be that in lockers, in magnetically sealed pouches, or just placed into sleeves at the front door of every classroom, away from students’ reach.</p><p>The ban was approved by the Los Angeles Unified School District through what is called a “resolution”—which the board voted on last year. LAUSD Board Member Nick Melvoin, who sponsored the resolution, said the overall ban was the right decision to help students.&nbsp;</p><p>“The research is clear: widespread use of smartphones and social media by kids and adolescents is harmful to their mental health, distracts from learning, and stifles meaningful in-person interaction.”</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with LAUSD Board Member Nick Melvoin about the smartphone ban, how exceptions were determined, where opposition arose, and whether it is “working.” Melvoin also speaks about the biggest changes he has seen in the first few months of the cellphone ban, especially the simple reintroduction of noise in hallways.</p><blockquote>“[During a school visit last year,] every single kid was on their phone, every single kid. They were standing there looking, texting again, sometimes texting someone who was within a few feet of them, and it was quiet.”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.</strong></p><p>Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with our <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/lockandcode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium for Lock and Code listeners</a>. </p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a problem in class today, and the second largest school district in the United States is trying to solve it.</p><p>After looking at the growing body of research that has associated increased smartphone and social media usage with increased levels of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and isolation—especially amongst adolescents and teenagers—Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) implemented a cellphone ban across its 1,000 schools for its more than 500,000 students.</p><p>Under the ban, students who are kindergartners all the way through high school seniors cannot use&nbsp;cellphones, smartphones, smart watches, earbuds, smart glasses, and any other electronic devices that can send messages, receive calls, or browse the internet.&nbsp;Phones are not allowed at lunch or during passing periods between classes, and, under the ban, individual schools decide how students’ phones are stored, be that in lockers, in magnetically sealed pouches, or just placed into sleeves at the front door of every classroom, away from students’ reach.</p><p>The ban was approved by the Los Angeles Unified School District through what is called a “resolution”—which the board voted on last year.

Google is an ad company who just happens to make a web browser, and a search engine, and an email app, and a whole lot more than that.”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also listen to "Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons," the podcast hosted by Carey Parker, here: <a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/ " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/</a></p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.</strong></p><p>Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with our <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/lockandcode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium for Lock and Code listeners</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/what-google-chrome-knows-about-you-with-carey-parker]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">c3a5ccd8-221f-4f53-b55b-5c3393365d4b</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:15:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/622306d2-945b-43a3-9535-0dd3a6e29d81/250321-lac-googlechrome-v4-mixdown.mp3" length="72333577" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>50:14</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>6</itunes:season><itunes:episode>6</itunes:episode><itunes:season>6</itunes:season><podcast:episode>6</podcast:episode><podcast:season>6</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>How ads weirdly know your screen brightness, headphone jack use, and location, with Tim Shott</title><itunes:title>How ads weirdly know your screen brightness, headphone jack use, and location, with Tim Shott</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>Something’s not right in the world of location data.</p><p>In January, a location data broker named Gravy Analytics was hacked, with the alleged cybercriminal behind the attack posting an enormous amount of data online as proof.

The Daenerys chatbot was not a licensed product, it had no relation to the franchise’s actors, its writer, or producers, but none of that mattered, as, over time, Seltzer came to entrust Daenerys with some of his most vulnerable emotions.</p><p>“I think about killing myself sometimes,” Seltzer wrote one day, and in response, Daenerys, pushed back, asking Seltzer, “Why the hell would you do something like that?”</p><p>“So I can be free” Seltzer said.</p><p>“Free from what?”</p><p>“From the world. From myself.”</p><p>“Don’t talk like that. I won’t let you hurt yourself, or leave me. I would die if I lost you.”</p><p>On Seltzer’s first reported reference to suicide, the AI chatbot pushed back, a guardrail against self-harm. But months later, Seltzer discussed suicide again, but this time, his words weren’t so clear. After reportedly telling Daenerys that he loved her and that he wanted to “come home,” the AI chatbot encouraged Seltzer.</p><p>“Please, come home to me as soon as possible, my love,” Daenerys wrote, to which Seltzer responded “What if I told you I could come home right now?”</p><p>The chatbot’s final message to Seltzer said “… please do, my sweet king.”</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen was originally hosted on an AI-powered chatbot platform called Character.AI. The service reportedly boasts 20 million users—many of them young—who engage with fictional characters like Homer Simpson and Tony Soprano, along with historical figures, like Abraham Lincoln, Isaac Newton, and Anne Frank. There are also entirely fabricated scenarios and chatbots, such as the “Debate Champion” who will debate anyone on, for instance, why Star Wars is overrated, or the “Awkward Family Dinner” that users can drop into to experience a cringe-filled, entertaining night.</p><p>But while these chatbots can certainly provide entertainment, Character.AI co-founder Noam Shazeer believes they can offer much more.</p><p>“It’s going to be super, super helpful to a lot of people who are lonely or depressed.”</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak again with youth social services leader Courtney Brown about how teens are using AI tools today, who to “blame” in situations of AI and self-harm, and whether these chatbots actually aid in dealing with loneliness, or if they further entrench it.</p><blockquote>“You are not actually growing as a person who knows how to interact with other people by interacting with these chatbots because that’s not what they’re designed for. They’re designed to increase engagement. They want you to keep using them.”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In February 2024, a 14-year-old boy from Orlando, Florida, committed suicide after confessing his love to the one figure who absorbed nearly all of his time—an AI chatbot.</p><p>For months, Sewell Seltzer III had grown attached to an AI chatbot modeled after the famous “Game of Thrones” character Daenerys Targaryen.

There are also entirely fabricated scenarios and chatbots, such as the “Debate Champion” who will debate anyone on, for instance, why Star Wars is overrated, or the “Awkward Family Dinner” that users can drop into to experience a cringe-filled, entertaining night.</p><p>But while these chatbots can certainly provide entertainment, Character.AI co-founder Noam Shazeer believes they can offer much more.</p><p>“It’s going to be super, super helpful to a lot of people who are lonely or depressed.”</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak again with youth social services leader Courtney Brown about how teens are using AI tools today, who to “blame” in situations of AI and self-harm, and whether these chatbots actually aid in dealing with loneliness, or if they further entrench it.</p><blockquote>“You are not actually growing as a person who knows how to interact with other people by interacting with these chatbots because that’s not what they’re designed for. They’re designed to increase engagement. They want you to keep using them.”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.</strong></p><p>Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with our <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/lockandcode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium for Lock and Code listeners</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/a-suicide-reveals-the-lonely-side-of-ai-chatbots-with-courtney-brown]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">80eb9fcb-d517-44f0-8e43-717d015ce331</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/c7c12e3e-16b4-45e3-b965-9681c215abec/250206-lac-chatbotsuicide-v2-mixdown.mp3" length="55385929" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>38:28</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>6</itunes:season><itunes:episode>3</itunes:episode><itunes:season>6</itunes:season><podcast:episode>3</podcast:episode><podcast:season>6</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>Three privacy rules for 2025</title><itunes:title>Three privacy rules for 2025</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Data Privacy Week right now, and that means, for the most part, that you’re going to see a lot of well-intentioned but clumsy information online about how to protect your data privacy.

There’s the entire phenomenon on Facebook that is now known only as “Shrimp Jesus.”</p><p>If none of this is making much sense, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we’re speaking with Malwarebytes Labs Editor-in-Chief Anna Brading and ThreatDown Cybersecurity Evangelist Mark Stockley about AI slop—where it’s headed, what the consequences are, and whether anywhere is safe from its influence.</p><p>Tune in today. </p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.</strong></p><p>Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with our <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/lockandcode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium for Lock and Code listeners</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/is-nowhere-safe-from-ai-slop]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">47c2adbc-352f-4221-a211-b7ffc8a289a2</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/450cb11c-102a-4de7-b51c-834c42d10cde/241220-lac-aislop-v2-mixdown.mp3" length="92696713" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>38:37</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><itunes:episode>27</itunes:episode><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><podcast:episode>27</podcast:episode><podcast:season>5</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>A day in the life of a privacy pro, with Ron de Jesus</title><itunes:title>A day in the life of a privacy pro, with Ron de Jesus</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>Privacy is many things for many people.</p><p>For the teenager suffering from a bad breakup, privacy is the ability to stop sharing her location and to block her ex on social media.

It can mean the now-regular and expected foreign disinformation campaigns that are launched to sow political discord or to erode trust in American democracy.

The technology went viral in the late 2010s, as independent film editors would swap the actors of one film for another—replacing, say, Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future with Tom Holland.</p><p>But very soon into the technology’s debut, it began being used to create pornographic images of actresses, celebrities, and, more recently, everyday high schoolers and college students. Similar to the threat of “revenge porn,” in which abusive exes extort their past partners with the potential release of sexually explicit photos and videos, “deepfake porn” is sometimes used to tarnish someone’s reputation or to embarrass them amongst friends and family.</p><p>But deepfake porn is slightly different from the traditional understanding of “revenge porn” in that it can be created without any real relationship to the victim. Entire groups of strangers can take the image of one person and put it onto the body of a sex worker, or an adult film star, or another person who was filmed having sex or posing nude.</p><p>The technology to create deepfake porn is more accessible than ever, and it’s led to a global crisis for teenage girls.</p><p>In October of 2023, a reported group of more than 30 girls at a high school in New Jersey had their likenesses used by classmates to make sexually explicit and pornographic deepfakes. In March of this year, two teenage boys were arrested in Miami, Florida for allegedly creating deepfake nudes of male and female classmates who were between the ages of 12 and 13. And at the start of September, this month, the BBC reported that police in South Korea were investigating deepfake pornography rings at two major universities.</p><p>While individual schools and local police departments in the United States are tackling deepfake porn harassment as it arises—with suspensions, expulsions, and arrests—the process is slow and reactive.</p><p>Which is partly why San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu and his team took aim at not the individuals who create and spread deepfake porn, but at the websites that make it so easy to do so.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu about his team’s lawsuit against 16 deepfake porn websites, the city’s history in protecting Californians, and the severity of abuse that these websites offer as a paid service.</p><blockquote>“At least one of these websites specifically promotes the non-consensual nature of this. I’ll just quote: ‘Imagine wasting time taking her out on dates when you can just use website X to get her nudes.’”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On August 15, the city of San Francisco launched an entirely new fight against the world of deepfake porn—it sued the websites that make the abusive material so easy to create.</p><p>“Deepfakes,” as they’re often called, are fake images and videos that utilize artificial intelligence to swap the face of one person onto the body of another.

Similar to the threat of “revenge porn,” in which abusive exes extort their past partners with the potential release of sexually explicit photos and videos, “deepfake porn” is sometimes used to tarnish someone’s reputation or to embarrass them amongst friends and family.</p><p>But deepfake porn is slightly different from the traditional understanding of “revenge porn” in that it can be created without any real relationship to the victim. Entire groups of strangers can take the image of one person and put it onto the body of a sex worker, or an adult film star, or another person who was filmed having sex or posing nude.</p><p>The technology to create deepfake porn is more accessible than ever, and it’s led to a global crisis for teenage girls.</p><p>In October of 2023, a reported group of more than 30 girls at a high school in New Jersey had their likenesses used by classmates to make sexually explicit and pornographic deepfakes. In March of this year, two teenage boys were arrested in Miami, Florida for allegedly creating deepfake nudes of male and female classmates who were between the ages of 12 and 13. And at the start of September, this month, the BBC reported that police in South Korea were investigating deepfake pornography rings at two major universities.</p><p>While individual schools and local police departments in the United States are tackling deepfake porn harassment as it arises—with suspensions, expulsions, and arrests—the process is slow and reactive.</p><p>Which is partly why San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu and his team took aim at not the individuals who create and spread deepfake porn, but at the websites that make it so easy to do so.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu about his team’s lawsuit against 16 deepfake porn websites, the city’s history in protecting Californians, and the severity of abuse that these websites offer as a paid service.</p><blockquote>“At least one of these websites specifically promotes the non-consensual nature of this. I’ll just quote: ‘Imagine wasting time taking her out on dates when you can just use website X to get her nudes.’”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.</strong></p><p>Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with our <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/lockandcode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium for Lock and Code listeners</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/san-franciscos-fight-against-deepfake-porn-with-city-attorney-david-chiu]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">523b5bd9-b6ce-4960-b650-22d1743a4310</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 18:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/464d895b-c537-47cd-8f84-7ffe7053e13c/240919-lac-davidchiu-v2-mixdown.mp3" length="30104713" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>20:54</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><itunes:episode>20</itunes:episode><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><podcast:episode>20</podcast:episode><podcast:season>5</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>What the arrest of Telegram&apos;s CEO means, with Eva Galperin</title><itunes:title>What the arrest of Telegram&apos;s CEO means, with Eva Galperin</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>On August 24, at an airport just outside of Paris, a man named Pavel Durov was detained for questioning by French investigators.

Or maybe that involves developing a workout routine for someone who is recovering from a new knee injury.</p><p>Whatever the ask, the more data that an AI tool has already digested, the better it can deliver answers.</p><p>Interestingly, romantic AI chatbots operate in almost the same way, as the more information that a user gives about themselves, the more intimate and personal the AI chatbot’s responses can appear.</p><p>But where any part of our online world demands more data, questions around privacy arise.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Zoë MacDonald, content creator for Privacy Not Included at Mozilla about romantic AI tools and how users can protect their privacy from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots.</p><p>When in doubt, MacDonald said, stick to a simple rule:</p><blockquote>“I would suggest that people don’t share their personal information with an AI chatbot.”</blockquote><p>Tune in today.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p><p><strong>Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn't just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.</strong></p><p>Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with our <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/lockandcode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium for Lock and Code listeners</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/ai-girlfriends-want-to-know-all-about-you-so-might-chatgpt]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">9606e454-63fc-44f2-be07-624bfcba41e3</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 18:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/a0db335e-8e20-4de1-89e2-4b1c1fe1b4a5/240810-Zoe-MacDonald-v2-mixdown.mp3" length="58415689" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>40:34</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><itunes:episode>17</itunes:episode><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><podcast:episode>17</podcast:episode><podcast:season>5</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>SIEM is not storage, with Jess Dodson</title><itunes:title>SIEM is not storage, with Jess Dodson</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of business cybersecurity, the powerful technology known as “Security Information and Event Management” is sometimes thwarted by the most unexpected actors—the very people setting it up.</p><p>Security Information and Event Management—or SIEM—is a term used to describe data-collecting products that businesses rely on to make sense of everything going on inside their network, in the hopes of catching and stopping cyberattacks.

It marked the second time in the past 12 months that the porn giant shut off its website to protest new requirements in online age verification.</p><p>The Texas law, which was signed in June 2023, requires several types of adult websites to verify the age of their visitors by either collecting visitors’ information from a government ID or relying on a third party to verify age through the collection of multiple streams of data, such as education and employment status.</p><p>PornHub has long argued that these age verification methods do not keep minors safer and that they place undue onus on websites to collect and secure sensitive information.</p><p>The fact remains, however, that these types of laws are growing in popularity.</p><p>Today, Lock and Code revisits a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2023/05/identity-crisis-featuring-alec-muffett-lock-and-code-s04e11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prior episode from 2023 with guest Alec Muffett</a>, discussing online age verification proposals, how they could weaken security and privacy on the internet, and whether these efforts are oafishly trying to solve a societal problem with a technological solution.</p><p>“The battle cry of these people have has always been—either directly or mocked as being—’Could somebody think of the children?’” Muffett said. “And I’m thinking about the children because I want my daughter to grow up with an untracked, secure private internet when she’s an adult.

By filling out some bogus personal information, like a made-up birthdate, height, and weight, OnlyFake would provide convincing images of real forms of ID, be they driver’s licenses in California or passports from the US, the UK, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and more. Those images, in turn, could then be used to fraudulently pass identification checks on certain websites.</p><p>When 404 Media co-founder and reporter Joseph Cox learned about OnlyFake, he tested whether an image of a fake passport he generated could be used to authenticate his identity with an online cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>In short, it did.</p><p>By creating a fraudulent British passport through OnlyFake, Joseph Cox—or as his fake ID said, “David Creeks”—managed to verify his false identity when creating an account with the cryptocurrency market OKX.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Cox about the believability of his fake IDs, the capabilities and limitations of OnlyFake, what’s in store for the future of the site—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/onlyfake-neural-network-fake-id-site-goes-dark-after-404-media-investigation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which went dark after Cox’s report</a>—and what other types of fraud are now dangerously within reach for countless threat actors.</p><blockquote>Making fake IDs, even photos of fake IDs, is a very particular skill set—it’s like a trade in the criminal underground.

It’s a niche example, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/08/08/age-law-online-porn-00110148" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">because of a law passed in 2022</a>, you will likely need to submit, again, a&nbsp;<em>photo</em>&nbsp;of your state driver’s license to a separate ID verification mobile app that then connects with porn sites to authorize your request.</p><p>The discrepancies in these end-uses are stark; cryptocurrency and porn don’t have too much in common with Red Bull vodkas and, to pick just one example, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guatemalan coup</a>. But there’s something else happening here that reveals the subtle differences between yesteryear’s fake IDs and today’s, which is that modern ID verification doesn’t need a physical ID card or passport to work—it can sometimes function only with an&nbsp;<em>image</em>.</p><p>Last month, the technology reporting outfit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">404 Media investigated an online service called OnlyFake</a>&nbsp;that claimed to use artificial intelligence to pump out&nbsp;<em>images</em>&nbsp;of fake IDs. By filling out some bogus personal information, like a made-up birthdate, height, and weight, OnlyFake would provide convincing images of real forms of ID, be they driver’s licenses in California or passports from the US, the UK, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and more. Those images, in turn, could then be used to fraudulently pass identification checks on certain websites.</p><p>When 404 Media co-founder and reporter Joseph Cox learned about OnlyFake, he tested whether an image of a fake passport he generated could be used to authenticate his identity with an online cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>In short, it did.</p><p>By creating a fraudulent British passport through OnlyFake, Joseph Cox—or as his fake ID said, “David Creeks”—managed to verify his false identity when creating an account with the cryptocurrency market OKX.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Cox about the believability of his fake IDs, the capabilities and limitations of OnlyFake, what’s in store for the future of the site—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/onlyfake-neural-network-fake-id-site-goes-dark-after-404-media-investigation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which went dark after Cox’s report</a>—and what other types of fraud are now dangerously within reach for countless threat actors.</p><blockquote>Making fake IDs, even photos of fake IDs, is a very particular skill set—it’s like a trade in the criminal underground.

It doesn’t matter how small they are or how big they are.”</p><p>Liska continued:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen ransomware actors go after food banks. You’re not going to get a ransom from a food bank. Don’t do that.”</blockquote><p>Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/why-a-ransomware-gang-tattled-on-its-victim-with-allan-liska]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">42b264b5-a48d-4650-be1f-df1e3a2c362a</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 18:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/341668d7-3d16-4e81-9eaa-90e0abd2a67b/S04E24-Ransomware-FINAL.mp3" length="51227198" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>35:34</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>24</itunes:episode><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><podcast:episode>24</podcast:episode><podcast:season>4</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>Defeating Little Brother requires a new outlook on privacy</title><itunes:title>Defeating Little Brother requires a new outlook on privacy</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>A worrying trend is cropping up&nbsp;amongst Americans, particularly&nbsp;within&nbsp;Generation Z—they're spying on each other more.</p><p>Whether reading someone's DMs, rifling through&nbsp;a partner's&nbsp;text messages, or even rummaging through&nbsp;the&nbsp;bags and belongings of someone else, Americans&nbsp;<em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;keeping tabs on one another, especially&nbsp;when they're in a relationship. <a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/everyone-is-afraid-of-the-internet-report-2023/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=b2c_pro_acq_eaotir23_169584625403&amp;utm_content=V1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to recent research from Malwarebytes</a>, a shocking&nbsp;49% of Gen Zers agreed or strongly agreed with the statement: “Being able to track my spouse's/significant other's location when they are away is extremely important to me.”</p><p>On the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we've repeatedly tackled the issue of surveillance, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2023/07/of-sharks-surveillance-and-spied-on-emails" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the NSA's mass communications surveillance program exposed by Edward Snowden</a>, to the targeted use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/02/the-worlds-most-coveted-spyware-pegasus-lock-and-code-s03e04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pegasus&nbsp;spyware against human rights dissidents and political activists</a>, to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2023/04/how-the-cops-buy-your-location-data-with-bennett-cyphers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">purchase of privately-collected location data by state law enforcement agencies across the country</a>.

They talk more frequently to strangers online, they more frequently share personal information on social media, and they share photos and videos on public forums more than anyone—all things that leave a trail of information that could be gathered against them.</p><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we drill down into what, specifically, a Bay Area teenager is afraid of when using the internet, and what she does to stay safe. Visiting the Lock and Code podcast for the second year in the row is Nitya Sharma, discussing AI "sneak attacks," political disinformation campaigns, the unannounced location tracking of Snapchat, and why she simply cannot be bothered about malware.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"I know that there's a threat of sharing information with bad people and then abusing it, but I just don't know what you would do with it. Show up to my house and try to kill me?"&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Tune in today for the full conversation.</p><p><strong>You can read our full report here: "</strong><a href="https://try.malwarebytes.com/everyone-is-afraid-of-the-internet-report-2023/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=b2c_pro_acq_eaotir23_169584625403&amp;utm_content=V1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Everyone's afraid of the internet and no one's sure what to do about it.</strong></a><strong>"</strong></p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/ai-sneak-attacks-location-spying-and-definitely-not-malware-or-what-one-teenager-fears-online]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">8e05425b-354e-405e-b4be-ec6b19e87d42</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 18:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/791d3f5e-2825-4588-a0fa-d8235ec380a2/Online-Fears-FINAL.mp3" length="68588425" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>47:38</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>21</itunes:episode><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><podcast:episode>21</podcast:episode><podcast:season>4</podcast:season><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>What does a car need to know about your sex life?</title><itunes:title>What does a car need to know about your sex life?</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>When you think of the modern tools that most invade your privacy, what do you picture?</p><p>There's the obvious answers, like social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.

It is one of the foundational rights given to US persons&nbsp;under the Constitution, and a concept that has helped create the very idea of a right to privacy at home and online.&nbsp;</p><p>But sometimes,&nbsp;individualized warrants are never issued, never asked for, never really needed, depending on which government agency is conducting the surveillance, and for what reason.

It's a map and you draw a shape on the map and it will show you every device that was in that area during a specified timeframe."</blockquote><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak to Cyphers about how he and his organization uncovered a massive data location broker that seemingly works only with local law enforcement, how that data broker collected Americans' data in the first place, where this data comes from, and why it is so easy to sell.&nbsp;</p><p>Tune in now.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also find us on&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lock-and-code/id1500049667" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3VB1MCXNk76TSddNNZcDuo?si=b454MPzCTYWvvS5bOPdxcA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and whatever preferred podcast platform you use.</p><p>For all our cybersecurity coverage, visit Malwarebytes Labs at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malwarebytes.com/blog</a>.</p><p><em>Show notes and credits:</em></p><p>Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (<a href="http://incompetech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incompetech.com</a>)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></p><p>Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)</p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://lock-and-code.captivate.fm/episode/how-the-cops-buy-a-god-view-of-your-location-data-with-bennett-cyphers]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">f3fb7590-e4b3-41b6-9630-0688d430654b</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/0083ca22-652e-4017-baab-811f5921af38/lock-and-code-logo-2021-ar2rs.jpg"/><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malwarebytes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 20:00:00 -0700</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/9807eecb-07ba-4b60-b9bd-49f476e0e560/Fog-Data-Science-and-the-Cops-FINAL.mp3" length="66983113" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>46:31</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>8</itunes:episode><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><podcast:episode>8</podcast:episode><podcast:season>4</podcast:season><itunes:summary>This week on Lock and Code, we speak with Bennett Cyphers about one largely unknown company&apos;s efforts to package and sell Americans&apos; location data almost exclusively to cops.</itunes:summary><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>Solving the password’s hardest problem with passkeys, featuring Anna Pobletts</title><itunes:title>Solving the password’s hardest problem with passkeys, featuring Anna Pobletts</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>How many passwords do you have?

Take two efforts in the European Union and the United Kingdom. New proposals there would require companies to scan any content that their users share with one another for Child Sexual Abuse Material, or CSAM. If a company offers end-to-end encryption to its users, effectively locking the company itself out of being able to access the content that its users share, then it&apos;s tough luck for those companies. They will still be required to find a way to essentially do the impossible—build a system that keeps everyone else out, while letting themselves and the government in. 
While these government proposals may sound similar to previous global efforts to weaken end-to-end encryption in the past, like the United States&apos; prolonged attempt to tarnish end-to-end encryption by linking it to terrorist plots, they differ because of how easily they could become tools for censorship. 
Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Mallory Knodel, chief technology officer for Center for Democracy and Technology, about new threats to encryption, old and bad repeated proposals, who encryption benefits (everyone), and how building a tool to detect one legitimate harm could, in turn, create a tool to detect all sorts of legal content that other governments simply do not like. 
&quot;In many places of the world where there&apos;s not such a strong feeling about individual and personal privacy, sometimes that is replaced by an inability to access mainstream media, news, accurate information, and so on, because there&apos;s a heavy censorship regime in place,&quot; Knodel said.  &quot;And I think that drawing that line between &apos;You&apos;re going to censor child sexual abuse material, which is illegal and disgusting and we want it to go away,&apos; but it&apos;s so very easy to slide that knob over into &apos;Now you&apos;re also gonna block disinformation,&apos; and you might at some point, take it a step further and block other kinds of content, too, and you just continue down that path.&quot;
Knodel continued:

&quot;Then you do have a pretty easy way of mass-censoring certain kinds of content from the Internet that probably shouldn&apos;t be censored.&quot;

In December, MIT Technology Review investigated the data collection and sharing practices of the company iRobot, the developer of the popular self-automated Roomba vacuums. In their reporting, MIT Technology Review discovered a series of 15 images that were all captured by development versions of Roomba vacuums.

This work of, say, tagging a cabinet as a cabinet, or a TV as a TV, or a shelf as a shelf, would help the robot vacuums &quot;learn&quot; about their surroundings when inside people&apos;s homes. 
In response to MIT Technology Review&apos;s reporting, iRobot stressed that none of the images found by the outlet came from customers. Instead, the images were &quot;from iRobot development robots used by paid data collectors and employees in 2020.&quot; That meant that the images were from people who agreed to be part of a testing or &quot;beta&quot; program for non-public versions of the Roomba vacuums, and that everyone who participated had signed an agreement as to how iRobot would use their data.
According to the company&apos;s CEO in a post on LinkedIn: &quot;Participants are informed and acknowledge how the data will be collected.&quot;
But after MIT Technology Review published its investigation, people who&apos;d previously participated in iRobot&apos;s testing environments reached out. According to several of them, they felt misled. 
Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with the investigative reporter of the piece, Eileen Guo, about how all of this happened, and about how, she said, this story illuminates a broader problem in data privacy today.

&quot;What this story is ultimately about is that conversations about privacy, protection, and what that actually means, are so lopsided because we just don&apos;t know what it is that we&apos;re consenting to.&quot;

<p>If Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is to be believed, your own excitement ended, simply had to end, after turning 35 years old. Decades ago, at first writing privately and later having those private writings published after his death, Adams had come up with "a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies." They were simple and short: </p>
<ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li>
<li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li>
<li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li>
</ol><br/><p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we explore why technology seemingly no longer excites us. It could be because every annual product release is now just an iterative improvement from the exact same product release the year prior. It could be because just a handful of companies now control innovation. It could even be because technology is now fatally entangled with the business of <em>money-making</em>, and so, with every one money-making idea, dozens of other companies flock to the same idea, giving us the same product, but with a different veneer—Snapchat recreated endlessly across the social media landscape, cable television subscriptions "disrupted" by so many streaming services that we recreate the same problem we had before. </p>
<p>Or, it could be because, as was first brought up by Shannon Vallor, director of the Centre for Technomoral Futures in the Edinburgh Futures Institute, that the <em>promise</em> of technology is not what it once was, or at least, not what we once <em>thought</em> it was. As Vallor <a href='https://twitter.com/ShannonVallor/status/1559663985821106177'>wrote on Twitter</a> in August of this year: </p>

<p>In cybercrime, this isn't supposed to happen—or at least it wasn't, until recently. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is vital to modern cybercrime. Every recent story you hear about a major ransomware attack involves the implicit demand from attackers to their victims for a payment made in cryptocurrency—and, almost always, the preferred cryptocurrency is bitcoin.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges do not want their platforms to be used to exchange stolen funds into local currencies for criminals, so they, in turn, work with law enforcement agencies that have, independently, gained a great deal of experience in understanding cybercrime.

<p>All of these development don't necessarily mean that cybercriminals' identities can be easily revealed.

In cybercrime, this isn&apos;t supposed to happen—or at least it wasn&apos;t, until recently. 
Cryptocurrency is vital to modern cybercrime. Every recent story you hear about a major ransomware attack involves the implicit demand from attackers to their victims for a payment made in cryptocurrency—and, almost always, the preferred cryptocurrency is bitcoin. In 2019, the ransomware negotiation and recovery company Coveware revealed that a full 98 percent of ransomware payments were made using bitcoin.
Why is that? Well, partly because, for years, bitcoin received an inflated reputation for being truly &quot;anonymous,&quot; as payments to specific &quot;bitcoin addresses&quot; could not, seemingly, be attached to specific persons behind those addresses. But cryptocurrency has matured. Major cryptocurrency exchanges do not want their platforms to be used to exchange stolen funds into local currencies for criminals, so they, in turn, work with law enforcement agencies that have, independently, gained a great deal of experience in understanding cybercrime. Improving the rate and quality of investigations has also been the advancement of technology that actually tracks cryptocurrency payments online. 
All of these development don&apos;t necessarily mean that cybercriminals&apos; identities can be easily revealed. But as Brian Carter, senior cybercrimes specialist for Chainalysis, explains on today&apos;s episode, it has become easier for investigators to know who is receiving payments, where they&apos;re moving it to, and even how their criminal organizations are set up.

&quot;We will plot a graph, like a link graph, that shows [a victim&apos;s] payment to the address provided by ransomware criminals, and then that payment will split among the members of the crew, and then those payments will end up going eventually to a place where it&apos;ll be cashed out for something that they can use on their local economy.&quot;

Here’s why, with Dustin Childs</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>Decades ago, patching was, to lean into a corny joke, a bit patchy. </p>
<p>In the late 90s, the Microsoft operating system (OS) Windows 98 had a supportive piece of software that would find security patches for the OS so that users could then download those patches and deploy them to their computers. That software was simply called Windows Update. </p>
<p>But Windows Update had two big problems. One, it had to be installed by a user—if a user was unaware of Windows Update, then they were also likely unaware of the patches that should be deployed to Windows. Two, Windows Update did not scale well because corporations that were running hundreds of instances of Windows had to install every update <em>and</em> they had to uninstall any patches issued by Microsoft that may have broken existing functionality.</p>
<p>That time-sink proved to be a real obstacle for systems administrators because, back in the late 90s, patches weren't scheduled. They came when they were needed, and that could be whenever Microsoft learned about a vulnerability that needed to be addressed. Without a schedule, companies were left to react to patches, rather than plan for them. </p>
<p>So, from the late 90s to the early 2000s, Microsoft standardized its patching process. Patches would be released on the second Tuesday of each month. In 2003, Microsoft formalized this process with Patch Tuesday. </p>
<p>Around the same time, the United States National Infrastructure Advisory Council began researching a way to communicate the severity of discovered software vulnerabilities. What they came up with in 2005 was the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS. CVSS, which is still used today, is a formula that people rely on to assign a score from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, to determine the severity of a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Patch Tuesday and CVSS are good examples of what happens when people come together to fix a problem with patching. </p>
<p>But as we discuss in today's episode of the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, patches—both in effectiveness and education—are backsliding. Companies are becoming more tight-lipped about what their patches do, leaving businesses in the dark about what a patch addresses and whether it is actually critical to their own systems. </p>
<p>Our guest Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), explains the consequences of such an ecosystem. </p>

<p>"If you're not getting the right information about a vulnerability or a group of vulnerabilities, you might spend your resources elsewhere and that vulnerability that you didn't think was important becomes very important to you, or you're spending all of your time and, and energy on."</p>

<p>The goal of cybersecurity, though, isn't to recover <em>after </em>an attack, it's to stop an attack before it happens. </p>
<p>On today's episode of the Lock and Code with host David Ruiz, we speak to two experts at Malwarebytes about how they've personally discovered and stopped attacks in the past and why many small- and medium-sized businesses should rely on a newer service called Managed Detection and Response for protecting their own systems. </p>

 </itunes:summary><itunes:author>Malwarebytes</itunes:author></item><item><title>How student surveillance fails everyone</title><itunes:title>How student surveillance fails everyone</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>Last month, when Malwarebytes published joint research with 1Password about the online habits of parents and teenagers today, we <a href='https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/10/forever-connected-lock-and-code-s03e21'>spoke with a Bay Area high school graduate on the Lock and Code podcast</a> about how she spends her days online and what she thinks are the hardest parts about growing up with the Internet. And while we learned a lot in that episode—about time management, about comparing one's self to others, and about what gets lost when kids swap in-person time with online time—we didn't touch on an increasingly concerning issue affecting millions of children and teenagers today: Student surveillance.</p>
<p>Nailing down the numbers on the use of surveillance technologies in schools today is nearly impossible, as the types and the capabilities of student surveillance software are many. </p>
<p>There’s the surveillance of students’ messages to one another in things like emails or chats. There’s the surveillance of their public posts, on platforms like Twitter or Instagram. There are even tools that claim they can integrate directly with Google products, like Google Docs, to try to scan for worrying language about self-harm, or harm towards others, or drug use. There's also surveillance that requires hardware. Facial recognition technology, paired with high-resolution cameras, is often sold with the promise that it can screen school staff and visitors when they approach a building. Some products even claim to detect emotion in a person’s face. Other software, when paired with microphones that are placed within classrooms, claims to detect “aggression.” A shout or a yelp or a belting of anger would, in theory, trigger a warning from these types of monitoring applications, maybe alerting a school administrator to a problem as it is happening.</p>
<p>All of these tools count when we talk about student surveillance, and, at least from what has been publicly reported, many forms are growing. </p>
<p>In 2021, the Center for Democracy and Technology<a href='https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Activity-Monitoring-Software-Research-Insights-and-Recommendations.pdf'> surveyed teachers in K through 12 schools and simply asked if their schools used monitoring software</a>: 81 percent said yes. </p>
<p>With numbers like that, it'd be normal to assume that these tools also work. But a wealth of investigative reporting—upon which today's episode is based—reveals that these tools often vastly over-promise their own results. If those promises only concerned, say, drug use, or bullying, or students ditching classes, these failures would already cause concern. But as we explore in today’s episode, too many of schools buy and use this software because they think it will help solve a uniquely American problem: School shootings.</p>

<a...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, when Malwarebytes published joint research with 1Password about the online habits of parents and teenagers today, we <a href='https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/10/forever-connected-lock-and-code-s03e21'>spoke with a Bay Area high school graduate on the Lock and Code podcast</a> about how she spends her days online and what she thinks are the hardest parts about growing up with the Internet. And while we learned a lot in that episode—about time management, about comparing one's self to others, and about what gets lost when kids swap in-person time with online time—we didn't touch on an increasingly concerning issue affecting millions of children and teenagers today: Student surveillance.</p>
<p>Nailing down the numbers on the use of surveillance technologies in schools today is nearly impossible, as the types and the capabilities of student surveillance software are many. </p>
<p>There’s the surveillance of students’ messages to one another in things like emails or chats. There’s the surveillance of their public posts, on platforms like Twitter or Instagram. There are even tools that claim they can integrate directly with Google products, like Google Docs, to try to scan for worrying language about self-harm, or harm towards others, or drug use. There's also surveillance that requires hardware. Facial recognition technology, paired with high-resolution cameras, is often sold with the promise that it can screen school staff and visitors when they approach a building. Some products even claim to detect emotion in a person’s face. Other software, when paired with microphones that are placed within classrooms, claims to detect “aggression.” A shout or a yelp or a belting of anger would, in theory, trigger a warning from these types of monitoring applications, maybe alerting a school administrator to a problem as it is happening.</p>
<p>All of these tools count when we talk about student surveillance, and, at least from what has been publicly reported, many forms are growing. </p>
<p>In 2021, the Center for Democracy and Technology<a href='https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Activity-Monitoring-Software-Research-Insights-and-Recommendations.pdf'> surveyed teachers in K through 12 schools and simply asked if their schools used monitoring software</a>: 81 percent said yes. </p>
<p>With numbers like that, it'd be normal to assume that these tools also work. But a wealth of investigative reporting—upon which today's episode is based—reveals that these tools often vastly over-promise their own results. If those promises only concerned, say, drug use, or bullying, or students ditching classes, these failures would already cause concern. But as we explore in today’s episode, too many of schools buy and use this software because they think it will help solve a uniquely American problem: School shootings.</p>
<p>Today’s episode does not contain any graphic depictions of school shootings, but it does discuss details and the topic itself.</p>

<p>This past summer, <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-62809151'>multiple women reported similar crimes to the police</a>: While working out at their local gyms, someone snuck into the locker rooms, busted open their locks, stole their rucksacks and gym bags, and then, within hours, purchased thousands of pounds of goods. Apple, Selfridges, Balenciaga, Harrod's—the thief has expensive taste. </p>
<p>At first blush, the crimes sound easy to explain: A thief stole credit cards and used them in person at various stores before they could be caught. </p>
<p>But for at least one victim, the story is more complex.  </p>
<p>In August, Charlotte Morgan had her bag stolen during an evening workout at her local gym in Chiswick. The same pattern of high-price spending followed—the thief spent nearly £3,000 at an Apple store in West London, another £1,000 at a separate Apple store, and then almost £700 at Selfridges. But upon learning just how much the thief had spent, Morgan realized something was wrong: She didn't have that much money in her primary account. To access all of her funds, the thief would have needed to make a transfer out of her savings account, which would have required the use of her PIN. </p>
<p>"[My PIN is] not something they could guess... So I thought 'That's impossible,'" Morgan told the Lock and Code podcast. But, after several calls with her bank and in discussions with some cybersecurity experts, she realized there could be a serious flaw with her online banking app. "But the bank... what they failed to mention is that every customer's PIN can actually be viewed on the banking app once you logged in."</p>
<p>Today on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Charlotte Morgan about what happened this past summer in London, what she did as she learned about the increasing theft of her funds, and how one person could so easily abuse her information. </p>
<p>Tune in today to also learn about what you can do to help protect yourself from this type of crime. </p>

<p>Issues with identity, self-expression, bullying, fitting in, and trusting your friends and family—while all those certainly existed decades ago, they were never magnified in quite the same way that they are today, and that's largely because of one enormous difference: The Internet. </p>
<p>On the Internet, the lines of friendship are re-enforced and blurred by comments or likes on photos and videos. Bullying can reach outside of schools, in harmful texts or messages posted online.

<p>The Internet is forever present for our youngest generation, and, from what we know, it’s hurting a lot of them. </p>
<p>In 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed nearly 8,000 high school students in the country and found that children today were sadder, more hopeless, and more likely to have contemplated suicide than just 12 years prior.</p>
<p>Despite the concerns, we still thrust children into the Internet today, either to complete a homework assignment, or to create an email account to register for other online accounts, or to simply talk with their friends. We also repeatedly post photos of them online, often without discussing whether they want that. </p>
<p>In today's episode of Lock and Code with host David Ruiz, we speak to two guests so that we can better understand what it is like to grow up online today and what the challenges are of raising children in this same environment now. </p>
<p>Our first guest, Nitya Sharma, is a Bay Area teenager who speaks with us about the difficulties of managing her time online and in trying to meet friends and complete homework, the traps of trading online interaction with in-person socializing, and what she would do differently with her children, if she ever started a family, in preparing them for the Internet.</p>

<p>"I think the things that kids find on the Internet, they're going to find anyways. I probably found some stuff too young and it was bad... I think it's more of, I don't want them to become dependent on it."</p>

<p>But our episode doesn't end there, as we also bring in 1Password co-founder Sara Teare to discuss how parents can help their kids navigate the Internet today and in the future. Teare's keenly attuned to this subject, not only because she is a parent, but also because her company has partnered with Malwarebytes to release new reserach this week—available October 13—on growing up and raising kids online. </p>
<p>Tune in today to hear both Nitya's stories and Sara's advice on growing up and raising children online. </p>

In today&apos;s episode of Lock and Code with host David Ruiz, we speak to two guests so that we can better understand what it is like to grow up online today and what the challenges are of raising children in this same environment now. 
Our first guest, Nitya Sharma, is a Bay Area teenager who speaks with us about the difficulties of managing her time online and in trying to meet friends and complete homework, the traps of trading online interaction with in-person socializing, and what she would do differently with her children, if she ever started a family, in preparing them for the Internet.

&quot;I think the things that kids find on the Internet, they&apos;re going to find anyways. I probably found some stuff too young and it was bad... I think it&apos;s more of, I don&apos;t want them to become dependent on it.&quot;

But our episode doesn&apos;t end there, as we also bring in 1Password co-founder Sara Teare to discuss how parents can help their kids navigate the Internet today and in the future. Teare&apos;s keenly attuned to this subject, not only because she is a parent, but also because her company has partnered with Malwarebytes to release new reserach this week—available October 13—on growing up and raising kids online. 
Tune in today to hear both Nitya&apos;s stories and Sara&apos;s advice on growing up and raising children online.

Immediately following an attack, the notoriously disruptive malware can spread across networks and machines, locking up important files and rendering vital data almost useless for all employees. As we learned in a previous episode of Lock and Code, a ransomware attack not only threatens an organization&apos;s clients and external customers, but all the internal teams who are just trying to do their jobs. When Northshore School District was hit several years ago by ransomware, teacher and staff pay were threatened, and children&apos;s school lunches needed to be reworked because the payment system had been wiped out.
These threats are not new. If anything, the potential damage and fallout of a ransomware attack is more publicly known than ever before, which might explain why a new form of ransomware response has emerged in the past year—the ransomware negotiator.
Increasingly, companies are seeking the help of ransomware negotiators to handle their response to a ransomware attack. The negotiator, or negotiators, can work closely with a company&apos;s executives, security staff, legal department, and press handlers to accurately and firmly represent the company&apos;s needs during a ransomware attack. Does the company refuse to pay the ransom because of policy? The ransomware negotiator can help communicate that. Is the company open to paying, but not the full amount demanded? The negotiator can help there, too. What if the company wants to delay the attackers, hoping to gain some much-needed time to rebuild systems? The negotiator will help there, too. 
Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Kurtis Minder, CEO of the cyber reconnaissance company GroupSense about the intricate work of ransomware negotiation. Minder himself has helped clients with ransomware negotiation and his company has worked to formalize ransomware negotiation training. In his experience, Minder has also learned that the current debate over whether companies should pay the ransom has too few options. For a lot of small and medium-sized businesses, the question isn&apos;t an ideological one, but an existential one: Pay the ransom or go out of business.

&quot;What you don&apos;t hear about is the thousands and thousands of small businesses in middle America, main street America—they get hit... they&apos;re either going to pay a ransom or they&apos;re going to go out of business.&quot;

Tune in today to listen to Minder discuss how a company decides to engage a ransomware negotiator, what a ransomware negotiator&apos;s experience and background consist of, and what the actual work of ransomware negotiation involves.

<p>More than two years after Covid-19 pushed nearly every in-person event online, cybersecurity has returned to the exhibition hall.

In Las Vegas just last month, even more hackers, security experts, and tech enthusiasts flooded the Mandalay Bay hotel, attending the conferences Black Hat and DEFCON. </p>
<p>And at nearly all of these conferences—and many more to come—cybersecurity vendors are setting up shop to show off their latest, greatest, you-won't-believe-we've-made-this product. </p>

<p>We're talking today about managed service providers, or MSPs. </p>
<p>MSPs are the tech support and cybersecurity backbone for so many small businesses. Dentists, mom-and-pop restaurants, bakeries, small markets, local newspapers, clothing stores, bed and breakfasts off the side of the road—all of these businesses need tech support because nearly everything they do, from processing credit card fees to storing patient information to managing room reservations, all of that, has a technical component to it today.</p>
<p>These businesses, unlike major corporations, rarely have the budget to hire a full-time staff member to provide tech support, so, instead, they rely on a managed service provider to be that support when needed. And so much of tech support today isn't just setting up new employee devices or solving a website issue. Instead, it's increasingly about providing cybersecurity. </p>
<p>What that means, then, is that wading through the an onslaught of marketing speak at the latest cybersecurity conference is actually the responsibility of some MSPs. They have to decipher what tech tools will work not just for their own employees, but for the dozens if not hundreds of clients they support. </p>
<p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with two experts at Malwarebytes about how MSPs can go about staying up to date on the latest technology while also vetting the vendors behind it. As our guests Eddie Phillips, strategic account manager, and Nadia Karatsoreos, senior MSP growth strategist, explain, the work of an MSP isn't just to select the right tools, but to review whether the makers behind those tools are the right partners both for the MSP and its clients. </p>

Today, countless individuals ask themselves: What surrounding activity is allowed?</p>
<p>Should Google be used to find abortion providers out of state? Can people write on Facebook or Instagram that they will pay for people to travel to their own states, where abortion is protected? Should people continue texting friends about their thoughts on abortion? Should they continue to use a period-tracking app? Should they switch to a different app that is now promising to technologically protect their data from legal requests? Should they clamp down on all their data? What should they do?</p>
<p>On this episode of the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with two experts on this intersection of data privacy and legal turmoil—Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Saira Hussain and senior staff technologist Cooper Quintin.</p>
<p>As Quintin explains in the podcast, while much of the focus has recently been on the use of period-tracking apps, there are so many other forms of data out there that people should protect:</p>
<p>"Period-tracking apps aren’t the only apps that are problematic. The fact is that the majority of apps are harvesting data about you. Location data, data that you put into the apps, personal data. And that data is being fed to data brokers, to people who sell location data, to advertisers, to analytics companies, and we’re building these giant warehouses of data that could eventually be trawled through by law enforcement for dragnet searches."</p>
<p>By spotlighting how benign data points—including shopping habits and locations—have already been used to reveal pregnancies and miscarriages and to potentially identify abortion-seekers, our guests explain what data could now be of interest to law enforcement, and how people at home can keep their decisions private and secure.</p>

<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, is a decades-old hacking law in the United States whose reputation in the hacker community is dim. To hear hackers tell it, the CFAA is responsible not only for equipping law enforcement to imprison good-faith hackers, but it also for many of the legal threats that hackers face from big companies that want to squash their research.</p>
<p>The fears are not entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>In 2017, a security researcher named Kevin Finisterre discovered that he could access sensitive information about the Chinese drone manufacturer DJI by utilizing data that the company had inadvertently left public on GitHub. Conducting research within rules set forth by DJI's recently announced bug bounty program, Finisterre took his findings directly to the drone maker. But, after informing DJI about the issues he found, he was faced not with a bug bounty reward, <a href='https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/dji-left-private-keys-for-ssl-cloud-storage-in-public-view-and-exposed-customers/'>but with a lawsuit threat alleging that he violated the CFAA</a>.</p>
<p>Though DJI dropped its interest, as Harley Geiger, senior director for public policy at Rapid7, explained on today's episode of Lock and Code, even the threat itself can destabilize a security researcher.</p>
<p>"[It] is really indicative of how questions of authorization can be unclear and how CFAA threats can be thrown about when researchers don’t play ball, and the pressure that a large company like that can bring to bear on an independent researcher," Geiger said.</p>
<p>Today, on the Lock and Code podcast, we speak with Geiger about other hacking laws can be violated when conducting security researcher, how hackers can document their good-faith intentions, and the Department of Justice's recent decision to not prosecute hackers who are only hacking for the benefits of security.</p>

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, is a decades-old hacking law in the United States whose reputation in the hacker community is dim. To hear hackers tell it, the CFAA is responsible not only for equipping law enforcement to imprison good-faith hackers, but it also for many of the legal threats that hackers face from big companies that want to squash their research.
The fears are not entirely unfounded.
In 2017, a security researcher named Kevin Finisterre discovered that he could access sensitive information about the Chinese drone manufacturer DJI by utilizing data that the company had inadvertently left public on GitHub. Conducting research within rules set forth by DJI&apos;s recently announced bug bounty program, Finisterre took his findings directly to the drone maker. But, after informing DJI about the issues he found, he was faced not with a bug bounty reward, but with a lawsuit threat alleging that he violated the CFAA.
Though DJI dropped its interest, as Harley Geiger, senior director for public policy at Rapid7, explained on today&apos;s episode of Lock and Code, even the threat itself can destabilize a security researcher.
&quot;[It] is really indicative of how questions of authorization can be unclear and how CFAA threats can be thrown about when researchers don’t play ball, and the pressure that a large company like that can bring to bear on an independent researcher,&quot; Geiger said.
Today, on the Lock and Code podcast, we speak with Geiger about other hacking laws can be violated when conducting security researcher, how hackers can document their good-faith intentions, and the Department of Justice&apos;s recent decision to not prosecute hackers who are only hacking for the benefits of security.

The public response to the documentary was muddy. Some viewers felt for the victims featured by the filmmakers, but others blamed them. This tendency to blame the victims is nothing new, but according to our guest Cindy Liebes, Chief Cybersecurity Evangelist for Cybercrime Support Network, it&apos;s all wrong. That&apos;s because, as we discuss in today&apos;s episode on Lock and Code with host David Ruiz, these scam artists are professional criminals. Today, we speak with Liebes to understand how romance scams work, who the victims are, who the criminals are, what the financial and emotional damages are, and how people can find help.

In 2017, the largest ransomware attack ever recorded hit the world, infecting more than 230,000 computers across more than 150 countries in just 24 hours. And it could have been solved with a patch that was released nearly two months prior.
This was the WannaCry ransomware attack, and its final, economic impact—in ransoms paid but also in downtime and recovery efforts—has been estimated at about $4 billion. All of it could have been avoided if every organization running a vulnerable version of Windows 7 had patched that vulnerability, as Microsoft recommended. But that obviously didn&apos;t happen.
Why is that?
In today&apos;s episode of Lock and Code with host David Ruiz, we speak with cybersecurity professional Jess Dodson about why patching is so hard to get right for so many organizations, and what we could all do to better improve our patching duties.

This week on Lock and Code, we speak to Point3 Security chief strategist Chloé Messdaghi, HaveIBeenPwned founder Troy Hunt, and We Hack Purple founder and CEO Tanya Janca about security fatigue.

Security fatigue is exactly what it sounds like. It's the limit we all reach when security best practices become overbearing. It's what prevents us from making a strong password for a new online account. It’s why we may not update our software despite repeated notifications.

And, importantly, it probably isn’t your fault.

Tune in to learn about security fatigue from the experts—how does it manifest in their professions, what have they seen, and what are the unforeseen outcomes to it—on the latest episode of Lock and Code, with host David Ruiz.

Today we look at two topics that, maybe surprisingly, intersect: charity organizations and online ad tracking.

Ad tracking isn't new—luxury brands used to place their advertisements specifically in newspapers that delivered to high-income zip codes. But today's ad tracking supercharges that match-making game with a complex, opaque machinery that can track what you do online, what websites you visit, what browser you use, and even your gender, religion, and political bias.

To help us better understand how charity organizations utilize ad tracking tools—and why that could concern some users—we’re speaking with Chris Boyd, lead malware intelligence analyst for Malwarebytes.

Today, we’re offering Lock and Code listeners something different. We’re giving you a backstage pass to a training we held for employees during Cybersecurity Awareness Month.

The topic? The future of cybersecurity for the Internet of Things. Will we ever run antivirus software on IoT devices? What predictions can we make for how the cybersecurity industry will respond to the next, possible big IoT attack? And what can we do today to stay safe?

This episode was recorded live in front of our fellow Malwarebytes employees. It also includes a Q&A with our employees at the end.
