    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Episode Summary: </b><br/>In this episode, Maribel Lopez speaks with Dell’s Chief Technology Officer and Chief AI Officer John Roese about Dell’s enterprise AI technologies from their development to their future. Roese explains how the initial magical thinking around artificial intelligence has shifted into a more practical approach that aims to maximize the benefits of each implementation. He also discusses the emerging trends and ideas that he is seeing in the AI space.<br/><br/><b>Key Themes: </b><br/>Maribel and John start by delving into enterprise AI and AI markets in general. John explains the types of AI markets and how enterprise AI differs from other applications. The conversation then moves into the challenges of AI and the steps that Dell is taking to address them. <br/><br/>Next, John and Maribel reflect on the near-universal reactive approach that companies took to AI two years ago and how parts of that approach backfired or fizzled out. While this technology could have been approached better, its widespread use has provided companies with a real world understanding of LLMs and their applications. Now, companies take a more practical approach to AI while continuing to innovate. <br/><br/>The key innovation that Roese highlights is agentic architecture. This technology differs from previous generative AI applications because it can operate autonomously and is highly specialized. Individual “agents” can have job descriptions that they are trained for much like a human being, and they can interact with each other as a human team would. <br/><br/>For detailed show notes, navigate the episode using the time stamps below:<br/><br/>[1:26] Maribel introduces the guest of the episode, John Roese. Roese is the CTO and Chief AI Officer at Dell Technologies. <br/><br/>[1:59] The AI market is not a singular market – there is a traditional market, a training market, and an enterprise market. The enterprise market is very pragmatic in its applications. <br/><br/>[4:10] Maribel asks about the challenges businesses see in enterprise adoption. Early discussions of new AI technology treated it like magic. Now that we have real world use cases and a better understanding of the technology, Dell is able to have grounded conversations about AI applications with real impacts. <br/><br/>[7:48] Roesch explains the challenges that Dell is facing with AI. One of the challenges was determining where to prioritize as a company. Another is the process by which you develop application ideas. Dell had this issue when bringing ideas that were not fully formed to their legal team. <br/><br/>[11:44] No one got AI perfectly right. Almost universally, companies reacted at the technical level before looking at business priorities. Roese encourages companies to move toward a more thoughtful approach to AI technology.<br/><br/>[13:36] Dell learned that its goal was to add in the minimum sufficient AI structure to address the maximum use cases. In Dell’s case, half of their use cases were related to converting proprietary data into generative outcomes. Creating one model to handle all of these cases is the most efficient approach. <br/><br/>[15:05] Maribel asks Roese about the trends Dell is seeing in AI. Roese points to the emergence of agentic architecture. The idea behind agentic architecture is that they are autonomously performing agents with very specialized purposes. They can be combined much like a team of human beings. <br/><br/>Follow John Roese: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnroese/ <br/><br/>Learn more about Dell’s AI solutions: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/scc/sc/artificial-intelligence <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on X/Twitter: https://x.com/maribellopez <br/><br/>Subscribe to Maribel Lopez on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MaribelLopezResearch <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/maribellopez/ </p>]]></description>

They can be combined much like a team of human beings. <br/><br/>Follow John Roese: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnroese/ <br/><br/>Learn more about Dell’s AI solutions: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/scc/sc/artificial-intelligence <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on X/Twitter: https://x.com/maribellopez <br/><br/>Subscribe to Maribel Lopez on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MaribelLopezResearch <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/maribellopez/ </p>]]></content:encoded>

Mudit explains that AI can be extremely helpful for hospital coordination. There are many cases in healthcare where the patient and the hospital system are aligned in their goals, like booking a surgery for a patient, but administrative complexities make those goals difficult to accomplish. <br/><br/>Qventus bases its system on two crucial components – behavioral science and machine learning. Machine learning is a great tool for determining patterns for coordination and scheduling, but factoring human behavior is crucial to create a model that actually works. Mudit credits the success of Qventus to the combination of these factors. <br/><br/>Maribel and Mudit also discuss the future of artificial intelligence in hospitals. Many industries are adopting AI in a wide range of applications, but Mudit suggests that healthcare systems should focus in on perfecting technology that benefits both patients and hospitals.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Episode Summary:<br/></b>In this episode, Maribel Lopez speaks with Roni Jamesmeyer about the changing role of AI in healthcare. Roni Jamesmeyer, the the Senior Healthcare Marketing Manager for Five9, has over twenty years of experience in IT sales, giving her an understanding of the complexity of healthcare delivery. She focuses on Five9&apos;s healthcare strategy to help health systems, payers, and life sciences move their contact centers to the cloud and close the gaps in patient communications. Maribel and Roni discuss technological advancements in AI, different uses of AI in healthcare, and Roni’s research findings.<br/><br/><b>Key Themes:<br/></b>Maribel and Roni open the episode by discussing the healthcare industry’s past attempts to improve the patient experience and how its goals have shifted. Currently, Roni is seeing healthcare companies working toward an omnichannel experience for their customers – meaning that they can interact over many communication channels. <br/><br/>AI is helping the industry move forward. Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) improve operations in four major ways: security, patient experience, revenue generation, and reduced administrative backend work. Different companies may focus more on some of these categories than others, but all four functions are extremely important to the healthcare industry. <br/><br/>Roni also discusses her AI research findings. She found that AI tuning is crucial to improvement, allowing models to pick up and retain information. As these models are used, they become more personalized and more intelligent and can take on more work as a result. She also found that AI agents open up phone lines, allowing previously missed calls to be answered. <br/><br/>Visit Maribel Lopez’s Website: https://www.lopezresearch.com/<br/> <br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on X/Twitter: https://x.com/maribellopez <br/><br/>Subscribe to Maribel Lopez on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MaribelLopezResearch <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maribellopez/ <br/><br/>Learn More About Five9: https://www.five9.com/ <br/><br/>Download AI in Healthcare: How AI Drives Value for Five9 Customers: https://www.five9.com/resources/ebook/how-ai-drives-value-healthcare-customers#:~:text=Partners-,AI%20in%20Healthcare%3A%20How%20AI%20Drives%20Value%20For%20Five9%20Healthcare,customer%20surveys%2C%20and%20analyst%20insight. <br/><br/>Attend Roni’s Webinar with Exact Sciences: https://www.five9.com/registration/2024/exact-sciences-webinar <br/><br/>Follow Roni Jamesmeyer on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/roni-jamesmeyer-5733461/ <br/><br/></p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Episode Summary:</b> In this episode, Maribel Lopez discusses responsible AI governance with Credo AI’s Head of Product Susannah Shattuck. Susannah builds AI governance tools that help organizations design, develop, and deploy ethical AI at scale. She has been working in Machine Learning Operations and AI governance for the last five years; her passion for AI governance can be traced back to her days on the IBM Watson implementations team, where she saw firsthand all of the things that can go wrong during the ML development lifecycle. Maribel and Susannah discuss the difference between responsible AI strategy and AI governance, the EU AI Act, and how she helps teams build governance plans that work for them.<br/><br/><b>Key Themes:</b> Maribel and Susannah begin their conversation by discussing the risks of generative AI. Large language models have overlapping risks with older models such as algorithmic biases, but they also come with new risks such as hallucinations, privacy risks, and security risks. <br/>Many companies want to implement AI, but those same companies recognize that they are not prepared for its risks. Susannah helps teams create AI governance plans that protect against risks without holding them back. She notes that it is not possible or practical to eliminate all risks, and that part of building a good strategy is allowing for low-risk use cases. <br/>Later in the conversation, Maribel and Susannah dive into how Credo AI works with organizations to implement responsible governance. They also discuss the EU AI Act, which will shape AI governance in the years to come. Last, Susannah shares her predictions for the future of AI implementation and AI governance. <br/><br/>Visit Maribel Lopez’s Website: <a href='https://www.lopezresearch.com/'>https://www.lopezresearch.com/</a> <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on X/Twitter: <a href='https://x.com/maribellopez '>https://x.com/maribellopez </a><br/><br/>Subscribe to Maribel Lopez on YouTube: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/MaribelLopezResearch'>https://www.youtube.com/c/MaribelLopezResearch</a> <br/><br/>Follow Maribel Lopez on LinkedIn: <a href='https://linkedin.com/in/maribellopez/'>https://linkedin.com/in/maribellopez/</a><br/> <br/>Follow Susannah’s LinkedIn: <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/susannah-shattuck/'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/susannah-shattuck/</a> <br/><br/>Follow Susannah’s Twitter: <a href='https://x.com/shshattuck?lang=en'>https://x.com/shshattuck?lang=en</a><br/><br/>Credo AI LinkedIn: <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/credo-ai/'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/credo-ai/</a><br/><br/>Credo AI Twitter: <a href='https://x.com/credoai?lang=en'>https://x.com/credoai?lang=en</a></p>]]></description>
