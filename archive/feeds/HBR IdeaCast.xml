<item><title>Navigating the Hybrid Work Dilemma</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2025/04/navigating-the-hybrid-work-dilemma</link><description>Many organizational leaders believe remote work is here to stay. Others are requiring employees return to the workplace. But Prithriwaj “Raj” Choudhury, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, says it’s not a simple managerial choice between two options.

But sometimes those incentives bring unintended consequences. New research identifies eight ways that salespeople across industries cheat or bend the rules to maximize their gain—often at the expense of the company&#039;s bottom line and customer loyalty. Huntsman School of Business professor Timothy Gardner and consultant Colin Wong explain these tactics, like sandbagging, falsifying data, and giving excessive discounts to close deals. The researchers also share how company leaders can audit, correct, and monitor an incentive program—and when they should let some practices slide to maintain productivity and motivation.

Lipp is a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business, an executive coach, and the author of the new book The Science of Personal Power. He’s investigated where this second type of power comes from, how it can enhance our lives, and how to tap into it using some simple strategies and tools.</itunes:summary><itunes:subtitle /><itunes:episode>1007</itunes:episode><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:duration>1536</itunes:duration><enclosure url="https://audio.hbr.org/ideacast/20241202135540-1007_HowToEnhanceYourLeadershipwith_PersonalPower_.mp3" length="27062034" type="audio/mpeg" />

Malcolm Gladwell&#039;s writing played a big role in changing that. His popular exploration of tipping points — the phenomenon where small, incremental actions can suddenly fuse into a full-blown social behavior — brought research insights to life and made them mainstream. Now he&#039;s revisiting tipping points, this time looking at how they can be used for damaging results. In this episode, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius speaks to Gladwell about how the author’s ideas have changed, the importance of social science and journalism in today&#039;s world of virality, and the unexpected ways leaders should consider human behavior.

But new research shows that the leave-taking process of the outgoing chief executive is often mishandled, with negative impacts on succession and the organization.

<item><title>Are You Asking the Right Questions?</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2024/04/are-you-asking-the-right-questions</link><description>Few leaders have been trained to ask great questions.

But in large organizations, with many layers of hierarchy, some of these roles feel like bureaucratic bloat, which, in tighter economic times, makes them a target for elimination. Emily Field, a partner at McKinsey &#038; Company, thinks in many cases that&#039;s a mistake. She argues that most middle managers are critical to corporate performance and productivity, executive team insight, and employee well-being.  The key is making sure their roles adapt to the times.

And many who get that kind of mentoring build on the lessons they learn to become leaders and role models themselves. Basketball star Chris Paul is a prime example. He had the support of a tight-knit family growing up, was mentored by a great coach in college, and as an NBA rookie looked to league veterans for guidance. Now, at age 38, he&#039;s the seasoned vet, a perennial All-Star across multiple teams who led the National Basketball Players Association from 2013 through the 2020 Covid-19 crisis and racial reckoning in the United States and is widely regarded as one of the best point guards of all time.

But sometimes the stresses that cause the most hard are the tiny, everyday ones that build up over time into a much bigger problem because we don&#039;t take the time to recognize and manage our reactions to them. Former HBR editor Karen Dillon and Babson College professor Rob Cross studied the most common types of &quot;microstress&quot; and the ways in which they impact individuals, teams, and organizations. They explain why, if left unchecked, microstress can lead to mistakes, burnout, damaged relationships, and poor mental and physical health.

Without the right culture, you can&#039;t have successful innovation. You can&#039;t compete successfully. You can&#039;t thrive over the long term. So, if you want to lead your organization into a future that features generative artificial intelligence, you need to build the right culture for it.

In this episode, How Generative AI Changes Organizational Culture, HBR editor Amy Bernstein speaks to two experts, Nitin Mittal and Tsedal Neeley, about how to adopt generative AI effectively and ethically within your organization. Mittal leads Deloitte’s global AI business and cowrote the book All-in On AI: How Smart Companies Win Big with Artificial Intelligence. Neeley is a professor at Harvard Business School and wrote the HBR article “8 Questions About Using AI Responsibly, Answered.” They discuss the risks, challenges, and emerging best practices of adapting organizational culture to generative AI.

How Generative AI Changes Everything is a special series from HBR IdeaCast. Each week, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius and HBR editor Amy Bernstein host conversations with experts and business leaders about the impact of generative AI on productivity, creativity and innovation, organizational culture, and strategy.

<item><title>4 Business Ideas That Changed the World: Emotional Intelligence</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2022/10/4-business-ideas-that-changed-the-world-emotional-intelligence</link><description>In the early 1990s, publishers told science journalist Daniel Goleman not to use the word “emotion” in a business book. The popular conception was that emotions had little role in the workplace. When HBR was founded in October 1922, the practice of management focused on workers’ physical productivity, not their feelings.

And while over the decades psychologists studied “social intelligence” and “emotional strength,” businesses cultivated the so-called hard skills that drove the bottom line. Until 1990, when psychologists Peter Salovey and John Mayer published their landmark journal article. It proposed “emotional intelligence” as the ability to identify and manage one&#039;s own emotions as well as those of others.

Daniel Goleman popularized the idea in his 1995 book, and companies came to hire for “EI” and teach it. It’s now widely seen as a key ingredient in engaged teams, empathetic leadership, and inclusive organizations. However, critics question whether emotional intelligence operates can be meaningfully measured and contend that it acts as a catchall term for personality traits and values.

4 Business Ideas That Changed the World is a special series from HBR IdeaCast. Each week, an HBR editor talks to world-class scholars and experts on the most influential ideas of HBR’s first 100 years, such as disruptive innovation, shareholder value, and scientific management.

<item><title>4 Business Ideas That Changed the World: Shareholder Value</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2022/10/4-business-ideas-that-changed-the-world-shareholder-value</link><description>The idea that maximizing shareholder value takes legal and practical precedence above all else first came to prominence in the 1970s. The person who arguably did the most to advance the idea was the business school professor Michael Jensen, who wrote in Harvard Business Review and elsewhere that CEOs pursue their own interests at the expense of shareholders&#039; interests. Among other things, he argued for stock-based incentives that would neatly align CEO and shareholder interests.

Shareholder primacy rapidly became business orthodoxy. It dramatically changed how and how much executives are compensated. And it arguably distorted capitalism for a generation or more. Critics have long charged that maximizing shareholder value ultimately just encourages CEOs and shareholders to feather their own nests at the expense of everything else: jobs, wages and benefits, communities, and the environment.

The past few years have seen a backlash against shareholder capitalism and the rise of so-called stakeholder capitalism. After reigning supreme for half a century, is shareholder value maximization on its way out?

4 Business Ideas That Changed the World is a special series from HBR IdeaCast. Each week, an HBR editor talks to world-class scholars and experts on the most influential ideas of HBR’s first 100 years, such as disruptive innovation, scientific management, and emotional intelligence.

That experience left Christensen puzzled. How could a small company with few resources beat rich incumbents?

It led to his theory of disruptive innovation, introduced in the pages of Harvard Business Review in 1995 and popularized two years later in The Innovators Dilemma. The idea has inspired a generation of entrepreneurs. It has reshaped R&#038;D strategies at countless established firms. And it has changed how investors place billions of dollars and how governments spend billions more, aiming to kickstart new industries and spark economic growth.

But disruption has taken on a popular meaning well beyond what Christensen’s research describes. Some critics argue that the theory lacks evidence. Others say it glosses over the social costs of lost jobs of bankrupted companies. And debate continues over the best way to apply the idea in practice.

With stopwatches and time-motion studies, Frederick Winslow Taylor ran experiments to find the optimal way to make the most steel with lower labor costs. It was the birth of a management theory, called scientific management or Taylorism.

Critics said Taylor’s drive for industrial efficiency depleted workers physically and emotionally. Resentful laborers walked off the job. The U.S. Congress held hearings on it. Still, scientific management was the dominant management theory 100 years ago in October of 1922, when Harvard Business Review was founded.

It spread around the world, fueled the rise of big business, and helped decide World War II. And today it is baked into workplaces, from call centers to restaurant kitchens, gig worker algorithms, and offices. Although few modern workers would recognize Taylorism, and few employers would admit to it.

<item><title>To Improve AI Outcomes, Think About the Entire System</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2022/10/to-improve-ai-outcomes-think-about-the-entire-system</link><description>Artificial intelligence technology has been advancing, and businesses have been putting it into action.

Out of reach of Japanese authorities, the once celebrated CEO of Nissan and Renault defends his legacy as he faces new investigations by French and other authorities.</p>
<p>In the final episode of a special, four-part series, host Curt Nickisch hears Carlos Ghosn&#8217;s side of the story and examines whether system failures contributed to his downfall. Who gave him this extraordinary power to run two global companies on different continents? What role did the corporate governance systems at Nissan and Renault play? What can we learn from his story?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decade into Ghosn&#8217;s tenure, Nissan starts missing his goals for growth, profits, and electric vehicle sales. Then a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan and a self-made crisis at Renault in France test his leadership. Who is holding Ghosn accountable?</p>
<p>In part three of a special, four-part series, host Curt Nickisch explores the cracks that appear in Ghosn&#8217;s track record. Did his aggressive performance targets harm Nissan in the long run? Was Ghosn stretched too thin, running two global companies eight time zones apart? Was anyone pushing back on his decisions? And after two decades leading the Japanese and French automakers, what was Ghosn&#8217;s succession plan?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Japan&#8217;s most famous CEO is suddenly arrested, conflicts are revealed in the Renault-Nissan Alliance, the French and Japanese auto companies that he led for two decades. Then Carlos Ghosn jumps bail by stowing away in a private jet to Lebanon. His daring escape raises new questions about his alleged financial misconduct and the corporate system that kept him in power. What went right &#8212; and wrong &#8212; at Nissan? How did Carlos Ghosn go from being one of the world&#8217;s most admired CEOs to a fugitive from justice?</p>
<p>This first episode of a four-part special series tells the story of his dramatic turnarounds at Renault and Nissan. Host Curt Nickisch explores Ghosn&#8217;s successes, discovering insights on working across cultural divides, winning buy-in on painful changes, and using outsider status to your advantage.</p>
<p>This special series is inspired and informed by the new book <a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/collision-course-carlos-ghosn-and-the-culture-wars-that-upended-an-auto-empire/10448"><em>Collision Course: Carlos Ghosn and the Culture Wars That Upended an Auto Empire</em></a>.</p>
<p>This episode was produced by Anne Saini. Contributing reporting from Tokyo by <em>Collision Course</em> coauthors Hans Greimel and William Sposato.</p>

<item><title>Goodbye Bureaucracy, Hello Common Sense</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2021/01/goodbye-bureaucracy-hello-common-sense</link><description>Martin Lindstrom, founder and chairman of Lindstrom Company, says that many companies are still held back by doing things the way they&#039;ve always done them, or failing to break down bureaucracy. For Lindstrom, it&#039;s not just about getting away from bureaucratic norms for the sake of innovation, but because so many things workers do each and every day don&#039;t actually make much sense. He suggests workers, leaders, and organizations consider ways in which processes can be improved - and the ways these new processes can improve life for everyone. And he argues that companies should actually devote a team or department to making sure common sense is used throughout the organization.

Studies show that, around the world, more people have been feeling a greater sense of social isolation, which has many negative affects, including increased blood pressure, reduced immune response, and decreased engagement and productivity at work. But organizations can be a place where people find a greater sense of belonging.

Duflo&#8217;s early life working at a non-governmental organization in Madagascar and volunteering in soup kitchens in her native France inspired her to study economics and research the root causes of poverty. With her fellow Nobel winners Abhijit Banerjee of MIT and Michael Kremer of Harvard, Duflo showed that effective policies often go against conventional wisdom and popular economic models. The only way to find out what works, she argues, is to rigorously test solutions on the ground, and she encourages businesses to do the same.

<item><title>Global Workers Are Ready for Retraining</title><link>https://hbr.org/podcast/2019/05/global-workers-are-ready-for-retraining</link><description>Joseph Fuller, professor at Harvard Business School, says that the story we hear about workers being afraid for the future of their jobs might not be right. In surveying 11,000 people in lower-income and middle-skills jobs and 6,500 managers across 11 countries, Fuller discovered that, contrary to what bosses believe, many employees are excited about new technologies and willing to be trained in new skills. But they don&#039;t always know what they need to learn or how to access and pay for it. Organizations can do a better job of identifying the skills gaps they have or will soon face and using their existing workforces to fill them.

She found that American moms were by far the most stressed, primarily because of the lack of parental benefits offered by their employers and the government. In Europe, women told Collins they had more help, but at times cultural norms around their personal and professional roles had yet to catch up.

She says the image of the charismatic, tall male with a top university degree who’s a strategic visionary and makes great decisions under pressure is a pervasive one. However, research shows that four behaviors more consistently lead to high performance in the corner office: 1) deciding with speed and conviction 2) engaging for impact 3) adapting proactively 4) delivering reliably. Botelho is the co-author of the article “What Sets Successful CEOs Apart” in the May-June 2017 issue of Harvard Business Review.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">445013b92a419a17f399fb3697c9f850</guid><media:thumbnail url="https://hbr.org/resources/images/podcasts/1400-hbr-ideacast-lg-3.jpg" /><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2017 09:47:21 -0500</pubDate><itunes:title>4 Behaviors of Top-Performing CEOs</itunes:title><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><itunes:summary>Elena Botelho, partner at leadership advisory firm ghSmart, talks about the disconnect between the stereotype of the CEO and what research shows actually leads to high performance at that level.

Williams, director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, discusses serious misconceptions that the U.S. managerial and professional elite in the United States have about the so-called working class. Many people conflate &quot;working class&quot; with &quot;poor&quot;--but the working class is, in fact, the elusive, purportedly disappearing middle class. Williams argues that economic mobility has declined, and explains why suggestions like &#8220;they should move to where the jobs are&#8221; or &quot;they should just go to college&quot; are insufficient.

In other words, inequality has less to do with what you do for work, and more to do with which specific company you work for.
