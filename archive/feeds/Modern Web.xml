			<title><![CDATA[The State of Authentication: The Future is BUNDLED!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Brian Morrison, Senior Developer Educator at Clerk. They cover the state of authentication today, what makes Clerk stand out for small teams and indie builders, and how thoughtful developer experience design can make or break adoption.Brian shares why bundling tools like auth, billing, and user management is becoming more common, how Clerk handles real-world concerns like bot protection and social login, and why starting with a great developer experience matters more than ever.The conversation also explores the role of AI in software development and content creation, where it helps, where it hurts, and how to use it responsibly without losing quality or trust.Keypoints for this Episode:</p><ul><li>Modern auth is about experience, not just security. Clerk simplifies user management, social login, bot protection, and subscription billing with developer-friendly APIs and polished default UIs.</li></ul><ul><li>Bundled platforms are making a comeback. Developers are shifting from handpicking tools to using tightly integrated services that reduce setup time and complexity.</li></ul><ul><li>Developer education needs more care and creativity. Brian emphasizes the importance of visual storytelling, thoughtful structure, and anticipating confusion to help devs learn faster and retain more.</li></ul><ul><li>AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement. The group discusses how AI can accelerate development and content creation when used with oversight, but warn against using it to blindly build entire apps.</li></ul><p>Follow Brian Morrison on Social MediaTwitter: <a href="https://x.com/brianmmdev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">https://x.com/brianmmdev</a>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmmdev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmmdev/</a>Sponsored by This Dot: <a href="thisdotlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">thisdotlabs.com</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Building AI Agents That Build AI Agents: Inside Chai.new]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel, Danny Thompson, and Adam Rackis sit down with Ahmad Awais, CEO and founder of LangBase, to talk about agents, context, and the future of AI-assisted software development. Ahmad shares the origin story of Chai.new, an agent that builds agents, and why he believes context, not code, is the true value layer in the AI era. The group unpacks how &quot;vibe coding&quot; is reshaping who can build software, why Chai isn’t just another AI assistant, and how agents might evolve into personalized, production-grade tools for everyone, technical or not. Plus: Tailwind analogies, Stanford lectures, sports nutrition agents, and a CLI that went viral in a hospital.Key points from this episode:- Ahmad Awais explains that AI agents aren&#39;t magic; they&#39;re just a new paradigm for writing software. What makes them powerful is their ability to act autonomously with relevant context, not just generate text.- Chai.new helps developers (and non-developers) create purpose-built agents without needing deep ML expertise. It abstracts complex concepts like memory, retrieval, and orchestration into an approachable interface.- Ahmad emphasizes that the real opportunity lies in agents tailored to individual users and use cases. Personal agents with custom context outperform generic ones, much like small teams beat massive frameworks for specific problems.- Chai and LangBase aim to bring AI development to the millions of engineers who aren&#39;t AI researchers. With tools like Chai, you don’t need a PhD to build powerful, production-ready AI agents.Follow Ahmad Awais on Social MediaTwitter: <a href="https://x.com/MrAhmadAwais" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://x.com/MrAhmadAwais</a>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrahmadawais/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrahmadawais/</a>Sponsored by This Dot: <a href="thisdot.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">thisdot.co</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson sit down with Julián Duque, Principal Developer Advocate at Heroku, to talk about Heroku’s evolution into an AI Platform-as-a-Service. Julián breaks down Heroku’s new Managed Inference and Agents (MIA) platform, how they’re supporting Claude, Cohere, and Stable Diffusion, and what makes their developer experience stand out.</p><p>They also get into Model Context Protocols (MCPs)—what they are, why they matter, and how they’re quickly becoming the USB-C for AI. From internal tooling to agentic infrastructure and secure AI deployments, this episode explores how MCPs, trusted environments, and better AI dev tools are reshaping how we build modern software.</p><p><br></p><p>Key Points from this episode:</p><p>- Heroku is evolving into an AI Platform-as-a-Service with its new MIA (Managed Inference and Agents) platform, supporting models like Claude, Cohere, and Stable Diffusion while maintaining a strong developer experience.</p><p>- MCPs (Model Context Protocols) are becoming a key standard for extending AI capabilities—offering a structured, secure way for LLMs to access tools, run code, and interact with resources.</p><p>- Heroku&#39;s AI agents can perform advanced operations like scaling dynos, analyzing logs, and self-healing failed deployments using grounded MCP integrations tied to the Heroku CLI.</p><p>- Despite rapid adoption, MCPs still have rough edges—developer experience, tooling, and security protocols are actively improving, and a centralized registry for MCPs is seen as a missing piece.</p><p><br></p><p>Chapters</p><p>0:00 – What is MCP and why it matters</p><p>3:00 – Heroku’s pivot to AI Platform-as-a-Service</p><p>6:45 – Agentic apps, model hosting, and tool execution</p><p>10:50 – Why REST isn’t ideal for LLMs</p><p>14:10 – Developer experience challenges with MCP</p><p>18:00 – Hosting secure MCPs on Heroku</p><p>23:00 – Real-world use cases: scaling, healing, recommendations</p><p>30:00 – Common scaling challenges and hallucination risks</p><p>34:30 – Testing, security, and architecture tips</p><p>36:00 – Where to start and final advice on using AI tools effectively</p><p>Follow Julián Duque on Social MediaTwitter/X: <a href="https://x.com/julian_duque" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/julian_duque</a></p><p>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliandavidduque/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliandavidduque/</a></p><p><br></p><p>Sponsored by This Dot: <a href="thisdotlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">thisdotlabs.com</a></p>

From internal tooling to agentic infrastructure and secure AI deployments, this episode explores how MCPs, trusted environments, and better AI dev tools are reshaping how we build modern software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Points from this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Heroku is evolving into an AI Platform-as-a-Service with its new MIA (Managed Inference and Agents) platform, supporting models like Claude, Cohere, and Stable Diffusion while maintaining a strong developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- MCPs (Model Context Protocols) are becoming a key standard for extending AI capabilities—offering a structured, secure way for LLMs to access tools, run code, and interact with resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Heroku&amp;#39;s AI agents can perform advanced operations like scaling dynos, analyzing logs, and self-healing failed deployments using grounded MCP integrations tied to the Heroku CLI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Despite rapid adoption, MCPs still have rough edges—developer experience, tooling, and security protocols are actively improving, and a centralized registry for MCPs is seen as a missing piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;0:00 – What is MCP and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:00 – Heroku’s pivot to AI Platform-as-a-Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:45 – Agentic apps, model hosting, and tool execution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:50 – Why REST isn’t ideal for LLMs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14:10 – Developer experience challenges with MCP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18:00 – Hosting secure MCPs on Heroku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23:00 – Real-world use cases: scaling, healing, recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30:00 – Common scaling challenges and hallucination risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;34:30 – Testing, security, and architecture tips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;36:00 – Where to start and final advice on using AI tools effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Julián Duque on Social MediaTwitter/X: &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/julian_duque&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://x.com/julian_duque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linkedin: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliandavidduque/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliandavidduque/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by This Dot: &lt;a href=&quot;thisdotlabs.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thisdotlabs.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[What Makes TanStack Form Different from Other Form State Managers?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Corbin Crutchley — founder of Playful Programming, Microsoft MVP, GitHub Star, and maintainer of multiple TanStack libraries including TanStack Form, Store, and Config.They dive into Corbin’s work maintaining open source at scale, what makes TanStack Form different (and a bit esoteric), and why the design decisions behind it matter, especially for enterprise teams. They also unpack the tradeoffs of abstraction, type safety in large-scale apps, and best practices for migrating form logic.Later in the episode, the conversation shifts to Corbin’s nonprofit and developer education philosophy: why Playful Programming focuses on deep conceptual understanding over task-based tutorials, how AI is changing how people learn, and what’s next for guiding developers from beginner to intermediate and beyond.Key points from this episode:– Corbin explains how TanStack Form’s architecture, though verbose and esoteric, enables strong type safety, SSR support, and integration with modern frameworks like Next.js and Remix.– The group discusses common pain points in migrating from other form libraries, especially around type inference and validation layers, and how TanStack Form encourages a clean separation of concerns.– Maintaining open source at scale requires balancing community feedback with a strong guiding philosophy; Corbin highlights the importance of civility and staying true to the project’s design principles.– Playful Programming focuses on deep, conceptual education over task-based tutorials, aiming to help learners move from beginner to intermediate with free, accessible content and personalized learning in the future.Chapters<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0">0:00</a> – Why TanStack Form Is Built This Way<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=66s">1:06</a> – Meet Corbin Crutchley and the TanStack Ecosystem<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=214s">3:34</a> – How Corbin Joined and Shaped TanStack Form<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=377s">6:17</a> – Why Use TanStack Form (Despite the Verbosity)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=628s">10:28</a> – Type Safety, Generics, and Enterprise-Ready Patterns<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=890s">14:50</a> – Validation Best Practices and SSR Integration<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=1125s">18:45</a> – Handling Feedback in Open Source<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=1282s">21:22</a> – Playful Programming: Teaching Concepts Over Tasks<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=1653s">27:33</a> – Bridging the Developer Education Gap<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=2154s">35:54</a> – Is It Still Worth Learning Programming?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=2305s">38:25</a> – The Evolving Role of Developers and Soft Skills<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&t=2517s">41:57</a> – Wrap-Up and Where to Connect OnlineFollow Corbin Crutchley on Social MediaLinkedin:   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corbincrutchley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/corbincrutchley</a>X/Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/crutchcorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">https://x.com/crutchcorn</a>Sponsored by This Dot: thisdot.co</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson talk with Corbin Crutchley — founder of Playful Programming, Microsoft MVP, GitHub Star, and maintainer of multiple TanStack libraries including TanStack Form, Store, and Config.They dive into Corbin’s work maintaining open source at scale, what makes TanStack Form different (and a bit esoteric), and why the design decisions behind it matter, especially for enterprise teams. They also unpack the tradeoffs of abstraction, type safety in large-scale apps, and best practices for migrating form logic.Later in the episode, the conversation shifts to Corbin’s nonprofit and developer education philosophy: why Playful Programming focuses on deep conceptual understanding over task-based tutorials, how AI is changing how people learn, and what’s next for guiding developers from beginner to intermediate and beyond.Key points from this episode:– Corbin explains how TanStack Form’s architecture, though verbose and esoteric, enables strong type safety, SSR support, and integration with modern frameworks like Next.js and Remix.– The group discusses common pain points in migrating from other form libraries, especially around type inference and validation layers, and how TanStack Form encourages a clean separation of concerns.– Maintaining open source at scale requires balancing community feedback with a strong guiding philosophy; Corbin highlights the importance of civility and staying true to the project’s design principles.– Playful Programming focuses on deep, conceptual education over task-based tutorials, aiming to help learners move from beginner to intermediate with free, accessible content and personalized learning in the future.Chapters&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&quot;&gt;0:00&lt;/a&gt; – Why TanStack Form Is Built This Way&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=66s&quot;&gt;1:06&lt;/a&gt; – Meet Corbin Crutchley and the TanStack Ecosystem&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=214s&quot;&gt;3:34&lt;/a&gt; – How Corbin Joined and Shaped TanStack Form&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=377s&quot;&gt;6:17&lt;/a&gt; – Why Use TanStack Form (Despite the Verbosity)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=628s&quot;&gt;10:28&lt;/a&gt; – Type Safety, Generics, and Enterprise-Ready Patterns&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=890s&quot;&gt;14:50&lt;/a&gt; – Validation Best Practices and SSR Integration&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=1125s&quot;&gt;18:45&lt;/a&gt; – Handling Feedback in Open Source&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=1282s&quot;&gt;21:22&lt;/a&gt; – Playful Programming: Teaching Concepts Over Tasks&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=1653s&quot;&gt;27:33&lt;/a&gt; – Bridging the Developer Education Gap&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=2154s&quot;&gt;35:54&lt;/a&gt; – Is It Still Worth Learning Programming?&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=2305s&quot;&gt;38:25&lt;/a&gt; – The Evolving Role of Developers and Soft Skills&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL2QoccTo0&amp;t=2517s&quot;&gt;41:57&lt;/a&gt; – Wrap-Up and Where to Connect OnlineFollow Corbin Crutchley on Social MediaLinkedin:   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/corbincrutchley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferer nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/corbincrutchley&lt;/a&gt;X/Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/crutchcorn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferer nofollow&quot;&gt;https://x.com/crutchcorn&lt;/a&gt;Sponsored by This Dot: thisdot.co&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Battle of the Agentic AI Platforms: v0 vs Bolt vs Replit]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, host Danny Thompson sits down with Ben Peeri, Lead Solutions Architect and Entrepreneur, for a candid and energetic conversation on how AI tools are reshaping the way developers build software. They explore the strengths and tradeoffs of platforms like v0, Bolt, and Replit, diving into how these tools fit into modern dev workflows—from quick POCs to potential production use.Ben shares his unique approach to local LLMs, including how he uses them for pen testing and simulating malicious actors to harden apps before release. The conversation also covers the shifting landscape for junior developers, why thinking like a product owner is more critical than ever, and what it means to lead a team of AI agents.Keypoints from this episode:- AI tools compared – v0, Bolt, and Replit each serve different purposes, from fast prototyping to more complex backend support, but all come with trade-offs in control and scalability.- Local LLMs for security – Running local models allows for safe pen testing by simulating bad actors, something API-based LLMs can’t do due to usage restrictions.- The role of prompting – Effective prompting, even using “carrot and stick” tactics, makes a big difference in the quality of LLM outputs and testing accuracy.- The evolving dev role – Junior devs will need to shift from building everything from scratch to refining and scaling AI-generated code—thinking more like operators of agent-powered dev studios.Follow Ben Peeri on Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benpeeri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/benpeeri/</a>Sponsored by This Dot: <a href="thisdotlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">thisdotlabs.com</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Fluid Compute: Vercel’s Next Step in the Evolution of Serverless?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, hosts Rob Ocel and Danny Thompson sit down with Mariano Cocirio, Staff Product Manager at Vercel, to discuss Fluid Compute, a new cloud computing model that blends the best of serverless scalability with traditional server efficiency. They explore the challenges of AI workloads in serverless environments, the high costs of idle time, and how Fluid Compute optimizes execution to reduce costs while maintaining performance. Mariano explains how this approach allows instances to handle multiple requests efficiently while still scaling to zero when not in use. The conversation also covers what developers need to consider when adopting this model, the impact on application architecture, and how to track efficiency gains using Vercel’s observability tools.Is Fluid Compute the next step in the evolution of serverless? Is it redefining cloud infrastructure altogether?</p><p><br></p><p>Keypoints</p><ul> <li>Fluid Compute merges the best of servers and serverless – It combines the scalability of serverless with the efficiency and reusability of traditional servers, allowing instances to handle multiple requests while still scaling down to zero.</li> <li>AI workloads struggle with traditional serverless models – Serverless is optimized for quick, stateless functions, but AI models often require long processing times, leading to high costs for idle time. Fluid Compute solves this by dynamically managing resources.</li>  <li>No major changes required for developers – Fluid Compute works like a standard Node or Python server, meaning developers don’t need to change their code significantly.

			<title><![CDATA[The Future of Open Source: Funding, Sustainability, and the Open Source Pledge]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, host Rob Ocel, along with co-hosts Adam Rackis and Danny Thompson, explores the sustainability of open source with Chad Whitacre, Head of Open Source at Sentry. Chad discusses the Open Source Pledge, an initiative encouraging companies to fund the open source projects they rely on. He breaks down the challenges maintainers face, the imbalance between corporate benefit and community support, and why businesses need to step up. The conversation touches on alternative funding models, the history of open source licensing, and the push to make sustainability a core part of the industry.

🔗 Learn more at <a href="opensourcepledge.com" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">opensourcepledge.com</a>.

Key Points
- The Open Source Pledge – Chad Whitacre, Head of Open Source at Sentry, explores the Open Source Pledge, which encourages companies to commit at least $2,000 per engineer per year to fund open source projects. The goal is to create a sustainable funding model for open source maintainers by shifting corporate mindsets toward recurring financial support.
- Challenges in Open Source Sustainability – The discussion highlights the core issue of open source sustainability: while software itself is freely available, the expertise and time required to maintain it are scarce resources. - Many maintainers experience burnout due to unpaid labor, and there’s no clear business model to fund independent contributors.
- Corporate Contributions Beyond Code – Whitacre outlines three ways companies can give back to open source: contributing code, offering in-kind resources (like infrastructure or bandwidth), and providing direct financial support. While many companies contribute code, direct monetary contributions remain rare.
- The Social Contract of Open Source – The conversation frames open source as a “gift economy,” where companies benefit from freely available software and have an ethical obligation to give back. Whitacre aims to normalize financial contributions to maintainers, likening it to paying for a meal after consuming it at a restaurant rather than expecting everything for free.

			<description><![CDATA[Rob Ocel and Adam Barrett interview Jason Laster, Co-Founder of Replay, and learn about time travel debugging and how Replay's browser development tool makes debugging easier and faster. One of the hardest issues in debugging is collecting enough information about an issue that you can reliably reproduce it and then validate the fix. In this podcast, Jason discusses how Replay helps capture information and gives you the ability to not only revisit bugged behavior, but add additional breakpoints, and even test fixes as if they were present in the system at the time.

			<description><![CDATA[In this podcast episode, Rob Ocel chats with Kathleen McMahon, a senior design systems engineer at Northwestern Mutual and a key contributor to the W3C Design Tokens Community Group.  
Kathleen McMahon kicks off the conversation by defining design systems as versatile collections of patterns and efficiencies that streamline workflows in design and engineering. She emphasizes that design systems can encompass diverse elements, such as design patterns, component libraries, CSS frameworks, and more, tailored to the unique needs of a company or product. The focus isn't on rigidity but rather on promoting consistency and efficiency while allowing flexibility for innovation.
The dialogue then shifts to Kathleen's role as a design systems engineer and the dynamic nature of her work, influenced by factors like team size and company maturity. Kathleen shares her experiences in both small, multifaceted teams and larger, specialized teams at Northwestern Mutual. She provides insights into the varied responsibilities, from creating design tokens and components to ensuring accessibility and collaborating with diverse stakeholders.
Rob and Kathleen delve into the invaluable role of design systems in simplifying workflows for designers and developers. Kathleen highlights how design systems liberate creative energy by offering reusable patterns, enabling teams to focus on solving more complex problems. They also explore the strategic decision of whether to build a design system within a specific framework or keep it framework-agnostic, shedding light on the considerations and potential challenges associated with third-party component libraries.
The episode culminates with a discussion of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) and its pivotal role in enhancing accessibility within design systems. Kathleen discusses the opportunities and challenges of leveraging libraries like Adobe's React ARIA hooks for accessibility.

			<title><![CDATA[Software Testing Strategies and Real User Engagement with Andrew Knight]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Andrew Knight, popularly known as automation panda, was recently interviewed on the Modern Web Podcast by host Rob Ocel. Andrew, a software quality champion, developer advocate, and test automation expert, shared his insights and experiences in the interview. He spoke passionately about testing and the importance of improving software quality. Andrew discussed the challenges he faced early in his career and how he recognized the opportunity to enhance software stability, readability, and speed through effective testing.
The conversation then shifted to the current state of testing in various tech communities. Andrew highlighted the wide variation in testing practices across companies, irrespective of programming languages or tech stacks. Smaller companies often lacked proper testing processes, while larger companies relied on traditional testing approaches that were deeply ingrained.
Advancements in web testing frameworks and tools were another topic of discussion. Andrew acknowledged the long-standing availability of functional testing, which simulates user interactions with a website. However, he pointed out the emergence of newer tools like Cypress and Playwright, which provide a modern developer experience, making web testing more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable. Andrew also emphasized the importance of addressing user experience and visual aspects of testing, where human evaluation remains crucial but can be supplemented by visual testing tools like Applitools.
The interview concluded with a glimpse into the future of autonomous testing. Andrew highlighted that while autonomous testing could never completely replace human exploratory testing, it held potential in understanding the behavior of software applications. The vision was to train autonomous agents to recognize established workflows, adapt to specific applications, propose test cases based on observed behaviors, and potentially execute these behaviors autonomously. This approach would allow developers to focus more on designing desired behaviors and less on implementing specifications.
Throughout the interview, Rob Ocel and Andrew Knight discussed the trade-off between investment and return in software testing. They reflected on the value of maintaining extensive test coverage and questioned its significance compared to the effort required to sustain it. Andrew emphasized the importance of focusing on valuable behaviors and understanding customer needs when prioritizing testing efforts. They also touched upon the idea that not all edge cases or hypothetical scenarios warrant investing time and resources in testing if they have minimal real-world impact.
Other topics covered in the interview include Andrew's talk on the eight Software Testing convictions, inspired by Japanese woodblock prints, which emphasize intentional design, accessibility, and the value of quality in software development. The discussion also revolved around the value of personas, engaging with real users to understand their needs and prioritize testing efforts accordingly. The interview highlighted the delicate balance between investing in quality and delivering value in software development and testing, with a focus on valuable behaviors and iterative learning from user interactions.

			<title><![CDATA[S09E08 Modern Web Podcast- ”If You Can JavaScript, You Can Backend” with Swizec Teller]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Software Engineer and Author Swizec Teller talks about how JavaScript developers have the tools, knowledge, and ability to write backend code whether they realize it or not. Swizec argues that, in a landscape in which serverless, distributed systems are becoming more common, the traditional line that separates frontend from backend development is steadily dissolving. Rather, an industry may emerge where developers are distinguished by their functional areas of expertise, and not whether they work on the interface or backend. They also talk about the distinction between monoliths, microservices, and serverless, with a focus on the purpose and function of the different architectures.

			<itunes:summary>In this episode of the Modern Web Podcast, Software Engineer and Author Swizec Teller talks about how JavaScript developers have the tools, knowledge, and ability to write backend code whether they realize it or not. Swizec argues that, in a landscape in which serverless, distributed systems are becoming more common, the traditional line that separates frontend from backend development is steadily dissolving. Rather, an industry may emerge where developers are distinguished by their functional areas of expertise, and not whether they work on the interface or backend. They also talk about the distinction between monoliths, microservices, and serverless, with a focus on the purpose and function of the different architectures.
