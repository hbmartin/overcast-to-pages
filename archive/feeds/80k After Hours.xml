        <![CDATA[<p>Most AI safety conversations centre on alignment: ensuring AI systems share our values and goals. But despite progress, we’re unlikely to know we’ve solved the problem before the arrival of human-level and superhuman systems in as little as three years.</p><p>So some — including Buck Shlegeris, CEO of <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/">Redwood Research</a> — are developing a backup plan to safely deploy models we fear are actively scheming to harm us: so-called “AI control.” While this may sound mad, given the reluctance of AI companies to delay deploying anything they train, <em>not </em>developing such techniques is probably even crazier. </p><p>These highlights are from episode #214 of <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/"><em>The 80,000 Hours Podcast</em></a>: <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/buck-shlegeris-ai-control-scheming/"><strong>Buck Shlegeris on controlling AI that wants to take over – so we can use it anyway</strong></a>, and include:</p><ul><li>What is AI control? (00:00:15)</li><li>One way to catch AIs that are up to no good (00:07:00)</li><li>What do we do once we catch a model trying to escape? (00:13:39)</li><li>Team Human vs Team AI (00:18:24)</li><li>If an AI escapes, is it likely to be able to beat humanity from there? (00:24:59)</li><li>Is alignment still useful? (00:32:10)</li><li>Could 10 safety-focused people in an AGI company do anything useful? (00:35:34)</li></ul><p>These aren't necessarily the most important or even most entertaining parts of the interview — so if you enjoy this, we strongly recommend checking out the full episode!</p><p>And if you're finding these highlights episodes valuable, please let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:podcast@80000hours.org">podcast@80000hours.org</a>. </p><p><em>Highlights put together by Ben Cordell, Milo McGuire, and Dominic Armstrong</em></p>]]>
