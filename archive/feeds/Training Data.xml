      <title>The Breakthroughs Needed for AGI Have Already Been Made: OpenAI Former Research Head Bob McGrew</title>
      <description>As OpenAI's former Head of Research, Bob McGrew witnessed the company's evolution from GPT-3’s breakthrough to today's reasoning models. He argues that there are three legs of the stool for AGI—Transformers, scaled pre-training, and reasoning—and that the fundamentals that will shape the next decade-plus are already in place. He thinks 2025 will be defined by reasoning while pre-training hits diminishing returns. Bob discusses why the agent economy will price services at compute costs due to near-infinite supply, fundamentally disrupting industries like law and medicine, and how his children use ChatGPT to spark curiosity and agency. From robotics breakthroughs to managing brilliant researchers, Bob offers a unique perspective on AI’s trajectory and where startups can still find defensible opportunities.

      <title>OpenAI Codex Team: From Coding Autocomplete to Asynchronous Autonomous Agents</title>
      <description>Hanson Wang and Alexander Embiricos from OpenAI's Codex team discuss their latest AI coding agent that works independently in its own environment for up to 30 minutes, generating full pull requests from simple task descriptions. They explain how they trained the model beyond competitive programming to match real-world software engineering needs, the shift from pairing with AI to delegating to autonomous agents, and their vision for a future where the majority of code is written by agents working on their own computers. The conversation covers the technical challenges of long-running inference, the importance of creating realistic training environments, and how developers are already using Codex to fix bugs and implement features at OpenAI.

      <title>From Data Centers to Dyson Spheres: P-1 AI's Path to Hardware Engineering AGI</title>
      <description>Former Airbus CTO Paul Eremenko shares his vision for bringing AI to physical engineering, starting with Archie—an AI agent that works alongside human engineers. P-1 AI is tackling the challenge of generating synthetic training data to teach AI systems about complex physical systems, from data center cooling to aircraft design and beyond. Eremenko explains how Archie breaks down engineering tasks into primitive operations and uses a federated approach combining multiple AI models. The goal is to progress from entry-level engineering capabilities to eventually achieving engineering AGI that can design things humans cannot.

      <title>The Quest to ‘Solve All Diseases’ with AI: Isomorphic Labs’ Max Jaderberg</title>
      <description>After pioneering reinforcement learning breakthroughs at DeepMind with Capture the Flag and AlphaStar, Max Jaderberg aims to revolutionize drug discovery with AI as Chief AI Officer of Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of DeepMind. He discusses how AlphaFold 3's diffusion-based architecture enables unprecedented understanding of molecular interactions, and why we're approaching a "Move 37 moment" in AI-powered drug design where models will surpass human intuition. Max shares his vision for general AI models that can solve all diseases, and the importance of developing agents that can learn to search through the whole potential design space.

      <title>Arc Institute's Patrick Hsu on Building an App Store for Biology with AI</title>
      <description>Patrick Hsu, co-founder of Arc Institute, discusses the opportunities for AI in biology beyond just drug development, and how Evo 2, their new biology foundation model, is enabling a broad ecosystem of applications. Evo 2 was trained on a vast dataset of genomic data to learn evolutionary patterns that would have taken years to find; as a result, the model can be used for applications from identifying mutations that cause disease to designing new molecular and even genome scale biological systems.

        <![CDATA[<p>Patrick Hsu, co-founder of Arc Institute, discusses the opportunities for AI in biology beyond just drug development, and how Evo 2, their new biology foundation model, is enabling a broad ecosystem of applications. Evo 2 was trained on a vast dataset of genomic data to learn evolutionary patterns that would have taken years to find; as a result, the model can be used for applications from identifying mutations that cause disease to designing new molecular and even genome scale biological systems.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by Josephine Chen and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital</p><p><br></p><p>Mentioned in this episode:</p><ul>

      <title>Replit CEO Amjad Masad on 1 Billion Developers: A Better End State than AGI?</title>
      <description>Amjad Masad set out more than a decade ago to pursue the dream of unleashing 1B software creators around the world. With millions of Replit users pre-ChatGPT, that vision was already becoming a reality. Turbocharged by LLMs, the vision of enabling anyone to code—from 12-year-olds in India to knowledge workers in the U.S.—seems less and less radical. In this episode, Amjad explains how an explosion in the developer population could change the economy, society and more. He also discusses his early days programming in Jordan, his unique management approach and what AI will mean for the global economy.

Hosted by David Cahn and Sonya Huang, Sequoia Capital 

Mentioned in this episode:

On the Naturalness of Software: 2012 paper on applying NLP to code 
Attention Is All You Need: Seminal 2017 paper on transformers
I Am a Strange Loop: 2007 follow up to Douglas Hofstadter’s 1979 classic Gödel, Escher, Bach that explores how self-referential systems can describe minds
On Lisp: Paul Graham’s 1993 book on the original programming language of AI</description>

      <title>From Software Engineers to AI Word Artisans: Filip Kozera of Wordware</title>
      <description>Filip Kozera sees parallels between Excel’s democratization of data analytics and Wordware’s mission to put AI development in the hands of knowledge workers. Drawing inspiration from Excel’s 750 million users (compared to 30 million software developers), Wordware is creating tools that balance the rigid structure of programming with the fuzziness of natural language. Filip explains why effective AI development requires working across multiple abstraction layers—from high-level concepts to detailed implementation—while preserving human creative control. He shares his vision for “word artisans” who will use AI to amplify their creative impact.

Hosted by Sonya Huang, Sequoia Capital

Mentioned in this episode:


Lovable: Generative AI app that builds UIs and web apps


Her: 2013 Spike Jonze film that Filip uses as an example of how voice will not be the best modality to express knowledge work.


Descript: AI video editing app that Filip uses a lot. 


Granola: AI notetaking app Filip uses every day.. 


Gemini 2.0 Pro: Google’s newest long context model that can handle 6000 page pdfs.

      <title>How AI Breakout Harvey is Transforming Legal Services, with CEO Winston Weinberg</title>
      <description>Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg explains why success in legal AI requires more than just model capabilities—it demands deep process expertise that doesn’t exist online. He shares how Harvey balances rapid product development with earning trust from law firms through hyper-personalized demos and deep industry expertise. The discussion covers Harvey’s approach to product development—expanding specialized capabilities then collapsing them into unified workflows—and why focusing on complex work like international mergers creates the most defensible position in legal AI.

The discussion covers Harvey’s approach to product development—expanding specialized capabilities then collapsing them into unified workflows—and why focusing on complex work like international mergers creates the most defensible position in legal AI.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital</p>]]>

      <title>The AI Product Going Viral With Doctors: OpenEvidence, with CEO Daniel Nadler</title>
      <description>OpenEvidence is transforming how doctors access medical knowledge at the point of care, from the biggest medical establishments to small practices serving rural communities. Founder Daniel Nadler explains his team’s insight that training smaller, specialized AI models on peer-reviewed literature outperforms large general models for medical applications. He discusses how making the platform freely available to all physicians led to widespread organic adoption and strategic partnerships with publishers like the New England Journal of Medicine. In an industry where organizations move glacially, 10-20% of all U.S. doctors began using OpenEvidence overnight to find information buried deep in the long tail of new medical studies, to validate edge cases and improve diagnoses. Nadler emphasizes the importance of accuracy and transparency in AI healthcare applications.

      <title>Palo Alto Networks’ Nikesh Arora: AI, Security and the New World Order</title>
      <description>Palo Alto Networks’s CEO Nikesh Arora dispels DeepSeek hype by detailing all of the guardrails enterprises need to have in place to give AI agents “arms and legs.” No matter the model, deploying applications for precision-use cases means superimposing better controls. Arora emphasizes that the real challenge isn’t just blocking threats but matching the accelerated pace of AI-powered attacks, requiring a fundamental shift from prevention-focused to real-time detection and response systems. CISOs are risk managers, but legacy companies competing with more risk-tolerant startups need to move quickly and embrace change.

      <title>Databricks Founder Ion Stoica: Turning Academic Open Source into Startup Success</title>
      <description>Berkeley professor Ion Stoica, co-founder of Databricks and Anyscale, transformed the open source projects Spark and Ray into successful AI infrastructure companies. He talks about what mattered most for Databricks' success -- the focus on making Spark win and making Databricks the best place to run Spark. He highlights the importance of striking key partnerships -- the Microsoft partnership in particular that accelerated Databricks' growth and contributed to Spark's dominance among data scientists and AI engineers. He also shares his perspective on finding new problems to work on, which holds lessons for aspiring founders and builders: 1) building systems in new areas that, if widely adopted, put you in the best position to understand the new problem space, and 2) focusing on a problem that is more important tomorrow than today.

Hosted by: Stephanie Zhan and Sonya Huang, Sequoia Capital

Mentioned in this episode: 


Spark: The open source platform for data engineering that Databricks was originally based on.


Ray: Open source framework to manage, executes and optimizes compute needs across AI workloads, now productized through Anyscale


MosaicML: Generative AI startups founded by Naveen Rao that Databricks acquired in 2023.


Unity Catalog: Data and AI governance solution from Databricks.


CIB Berkeley: Multi-strategy hedge fund at UC Berkeley that commercializes research in the UC system.


Hadoop: A long-time leading platform for large scale distributed computing.


VLLM and Chatbot Arena: Two of Ion’s students’ projects that he wanted to highlight.</description>

      <title>Ramp CEO Eric Glyman: Using AI to Build “Self-Driving Money”</title>
      <description>When ChatGPT ushered in a new paradigm of AI in everyday use, many companies attempted to adapt to the new paradigm by rushing to add chat interfaces to their products. Eric has a different take—he doesn’t think chatbots are the right form factor for everything. He thinks “zero-touch” automation that works invisibly in the background can be more valuable in many cases. He cites self-driving cars as an analogy—or in this case, “self-driving money.” Ramp is a new kind of finance management company for businesses, offering AI-powered financial tools to help companies handle spending and expense processes. We’ll hear why Eric thinks AI that you never see is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing time spent on drudgery and unlocking more time for meaningful work.

      <title>Dust’s Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu: Getting the Most From AI With Multiple Custom Agents</title>
      <description>Founded in early 2023 after spending years at Stripe and OpenAI, Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu started Dust with the view that one model will not rule them all, and that multi-model integration will be key to getting the most value out of AI assistants. In this episode we’ll hear why they believe the proprietary data you have in silos will be key to unlocking the full power of AI, get their perspective on the evolving model landscape, and how AI can augment rather than replace human capabilities.

00:00 - Introduction
02:16 - One model will not rule them all 
07:15 - Reasoning breakthroughs
11:15 - Trends in AI models
13:32 - The future of the open source ecosystem
16:16 - Model quality and performance
21:44 - “No GPUs before PMF”
27:24 - Dust in action 
37:40 - How do you find “the makers”
42:36 - The beliefs Dust lives by
50:03 - Keeping the human in the loop

      <title>How Glean CEO Arvind Jain Solved the Enterprise Search Problem – and What It Means for AI at Work</title>
      <description>Years before co-founding Glean, Arvind was an early Google employee who helped design the search algorithm. Today, Glean is building search and work assistants inside the enterprise, which is arguably an even harder problem. One of the reasons enterprise search is so difficult is that each individual at the company has different permissions and access to different documents and information, meaning that every search needs to be fully personalized. Solving this difficult ingestion and ranking problem also unlocks a key problem for AI: feeding the right context into LLMs to make them useful for your enterprise context. Arvind and his team are harnessing generative AI to synthesize, make connections, and turbo-change knowledge work. Hear Arvind’s vision for what kind of work we’ll do when work AI assistants reach their potential.

      <title>OpenAI Researcher Dan Roberts on What Physics Can Teach Us About AI</title>
      <description>In recent years there’s been an influx of theoretical physicists into the leading AI labs. Do they have unique capabilities suited to studying large models or is it just herd behavior? To find out, we talked to our former AI Fellow (and now OpenAI researcher) Dan Roberts.

Roberts, co-author of The Principles of Deep Learning Theory, is at the forefront of research that applies the tools of theoretical physics to another type of large complex system, deep neural networks. Dan believes that DLLs, and eventually LLMs, are interpretable in the same way a large collection of atoms is—at the system level. He also thinks that emphasis on scaling laws will balance with new ideas and architectures over time as scaling asymptotes economically.

      <title>Google NotebookLM’s Raiza Martin and Jason Spielman on Creating Delightful AI Podcast Hosts and the Potential for Source-Grounded AI</title>
      <description>NotebookLM from Google Labs has become the breakout viral AI product of the year. The feature that catapulted it to viral fame is Audio Overview, which generates eerily realistic two-host podcast audio from any input you upload—written doc, audio or video file, or even a PDF. But to describe NotebookLM as a “podcast generator” is to vastly undersell it. The real magic of the product is in offering multi-modal dimensions to explore your own content in new ways—with context that’s surprisingly additive. 200-page training manuals become synthesized into digestible chapters, turned into a 10-minute podcast—or both—and shared with the sales team, just to cite one example. Raiza Martin and Jason Speilman join us to discuss how the magic happens, and what’s next for source-grounded AI.

      <title>Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy on Using Data to Create Simple, Reliable AI for Businesses</title>
      <description>All of us as consumers have felt the magic of ChatGPT—but also the occasional errors and hallucinations that make off-the-shelf language models problematic for business use cases with no tolerance for errors. Case in point: A model deployed to help create a summary for this episode stated that Sridhar Ramaswamy previously led PyTorch at Meta. He did not. He spent years running Google’s ads business and now serves as CEO of Snowflake, which he describes as the data cloud for the AI era.

Ramaswamy discusses how smart systems design helped Snowflake create reliable "talk-to-your-data" applications with over 90% accuracy, compared to around 45% for out-of-the-box solutions using off the shelf LLMs. He describes Snowflake's commitment to making reliable AI simple for their customers, turning complex software engineering projects into straightforward tasks. 

Finally, he stresses that even as frontier models progress, there is significant value to be unlocked from current models by applying them more effectively across various domains.

      <title>OpenAI's Noam Brown, Ilge Akkaya and Hunter Lightman on o1 and Teaching LLMs to Reason Better</title>
      <description>Combining LLMs with AlphaGo-style deep reinforcement learning has been a holy grail for many leading AI labs, and with o1 (aka Strawberry) we are seeing the most general merging of the two modes to date. o1 is admittedly better at math than essay writing, but it has already achieved SOTA on a number of math, coding and reasoning benchmarks.
Deep RL legend and now OpenAI researcher Noam Brown and teammates Ilge Akkaya and Hunter Lightman discuss the ah-ha moments on the way to the release of o1, how it uses chains of thought and backtracking to think through problems, the discovery of strong test-time compute scaling laws and what to expect as the model gets better. 
Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital 
Mentioned in this episode:


Learning to Reason with LLMs: Technical report accompanying the launch of OpenAI o1.


Generator verifier gap: Concept Noam explains in terms of what kinds of problems benefit from more inference-time compute.


Agent57: Outperforming the human Atari benchmark, 2020 paper where DeepMind demonstrated “the first deep reinforcement learning agent to obtain a score that is above the human baseline on all 57 Atari 2600 games.”


Move 37: Pivotal move in AlphaGo’s second game against Lee Sedol where it made a move so surprising that Sedol thought it must be a mistake, and only later discovered he had lost the game to a superhuman move.


IOI competition: OpenAI entered o1 into the International Olympiad in Informatics and received a Silver Medal.


System 1, System 2: The thesis if Danial Khaneman’s pivotal book of behavioral economics, Thinking, Fast and Slow, that positied two distinct modes of thought, with System 1 being fast and instinctive and System 2 being slow and rational.


AlphaZero: The predecessor to AlphaGo which learned a variety of games completely from scratch through self-play. Interestingly, self-play doesn’t seem to have a role in o1.


Solving Rubik’s Cube with a robot hand: Early OpenAI robotics paper that Ilge Akkaya worked on.


The Last Question: Science fiction story by Isaac Asimov with interesting parallels to scaling inference-time compute.


Strawberry: Why?


O1-mini: A smaller, more efficient version of 1 for applications that require reasoning without broad world knowledge.

      <title>Why Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim of Harmonic Think AI Is About to Change Math—and Why It Matters</title>
      <description>Adding code to LLM training data is a known method of improving a model’s reasoning skills. But wouldn’t math, the basis of all reasoning, be even better? Up until recently, there just wasn’t enough usable data that describes mathematics to make this feasible.
A few years ago, Vlad Tenev (also founder of Robinhood) and Tudor Achim noticed the rise of the community around an esoteric programming language called Lean that was gaining traction among mathematicians. The combination of that and the past decade’s rise of autoregressive models capable of fast, flexible learning made them think the time was now and they founded Harmonic. Their mission is both lofty—mathematical superintelligence—and imminently practical, verifying all safety-critical software.
Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital 
Mentioned in this episode:


IMO and the Millennium Prize: Two significant global competitions Harmonic hopes to win (soon)


Riemann hypothesis: One of the most difficult unsolved math conjectures (and a Millenium Prize problem) most recently in the sights of MIT mathematician Larry Guth



Terry Tao: perhaps the greatest living mathematician and Vlad’s professor at UCLA


Lean: an open source functional language for code verification launched by Leonardo de Moura when at Microsoft Research in 2013 that powers the Lean Theorem Prover


mathlib: the largest math textbook in the world, all written in Lean


Metaculus: online prediction platform that tracks and scores thousands of forecasters


Minecraft Beaten in 20 Seconds: The video Vlad references as an analogy to AI math


Navier-Stokes equations: another important Millenium Prize math problem. Vlad considers this more tractable that Riemann


John von Neumann: Hungarian mathematician and polymath that made foundational contributions to computing, the Manhattan Project and game theory


Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: co-inventor of calculus and (remarkably) creator of the “universal characteristic,” a system for reasoning through a language of symbols and calculations—anticipating Lean and Harmonic by 350 years!

      <title>Jim Fan on Nvidia’s Embodied AI Lab and Jensen Huang’s Prediction that All Robots will be Autonomous</title>
      <description>AI researcher Jim Fan has had a charmed career. He was OpenAI’s first intern before he did his PhD at Stanford with “godmother of AI,” Fei-Fei Li. He graduated into a research scientist position at Nvidia and now leads its Embodied AI “GEAR” group. The lab’s current work spans foundation models for humanoid robots to agents for virtual worlds.
Jim describes a three-pronged data strategy for robotics, combining internet-scale data, simulation data and real world robot data. He believes that in the next few years it will be possible to create a “foundation agent” that can generalize across skills, embodiments and realities—both physical and virtual. He also supports Jensen Huang’s idea that “Everything that moves will eventually be autonomous.”

        <![CDATA[<p>AI researcher Jim Fan has had a charmed career. He was OpenAI’s first intern before he did his PhD at Stanford with “godmother of AI,” Fei-Fei Li. He graduated into a research scientist position at Nvidia and now leads its Embodied AI “GEAR” group. The lab’s current work spans foundation models for humanoid robots to agents for virtual worlds.</p><p>Jim describes a three-pronged data strategy for robotics, combining internet-scale data, simulation data and real world robot data. He believes that in the next few years it will be possible to create a “foundation agent” that can generalize across skills, embodiments and realities—both physical and virtual. He also supports Jensen Huang’s idea that “Everything that moves will eventually be autonomous.”</p><p>Hosted by: Stephanie Zhan and Sonya Huang, Sequoia Capital</p><p>Mentioned in this episode:</p><ul>

      <title>Founder Eric Steinberger on Magic’s Counterintuitive Approach to Pursuing AGI </title>
      <description>There’s a new archetype in Silicon Valley, the AI researcher turned founder. Instead of tinkering in a garage they write papers that earn them the right to collaborate with cutting-edge labs until they break out and start their own.

This is the story of wunderkind Eric Steinberger, the founder and CEO of Magic.dev. Eric came to programming through his obsession with AI and caught the attention of DeepMind researchers as a high school student. In 2022 he realized that AGI was closer than he had previously thought and started Magic to automate the software engineering necessary to get there. Among his counterintuitive ideas are the need to train proprietary large models, that value will not accrue in the application layer and that the best agents will manage themselves. Eric also talks about Magic’s recent 100M token context window model and the HashHop eval they’re open sourcing.

Hosted by: Sonya Huang, Sequoia Capital

      <title>Sierra Co-Founder Clay Bavor on Making Customer-Facing AI Agents Delightful</title>
      <description>Customer service is hands down the first killer app of generative AI for businesses. The reasons are simple: the costs of existing solutions are so high, the satisfaction so low and the margin for ROI so wide. But trusting your interactions with customers to hallucination-prone LLMs can be daunting.
Enter Sierra. Co-founder Clay Bavor walks us through the sophisticated engineering challenges his team solved along the way to delivering AI agents for all aspects of the customer experience that are delightful, safe and reliable—and being deployed widely by Sierra’s customers. The Company’s AgentOS enables businesses to create branded AI agents to interact with customers, follow nuanced policies and even handle customer retention and upsell. Clay describes how companies can capture their brand voice, values and internal processes to create AI agents that truly represent the business.

      <title>Phaidra’s Jim Gao on Building the Fourth Industrial Revolution with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <description>After AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, a young mechanical engineer at Google thought of another game reinforcement learning could win: energy optimization at data centers. Jim Gao convinced his bosses at the Google data center team to let him work with the DeepMind team to try. The initial pilot resulted in a 40% energy savings and led he and his co-founders to start Phaidra to turn this technology into a product.

Jim discusses the challenges of AI readiness in industrial settings and how we have to build on top of the control systems of the 70s and 80s to achieve the promise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. He believes this new world of self-learning systems and self-improving infrastructure is a key factor in addressing global climate change.

Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital 

Mentioned in this episode:


Mustafa Suleyman: Co-founder of DeepMind and Inflection AI and currently CEO of Microsoft AI, known to his friends as “Moose”


Joe Kava: Google VP of data centers who Jim sent his initial email to pitching the idea that would eventually become Phaidra


Constrained optimization: the class of problem that reinforcement learning can be applied to in real world systems 


Vedavyas Panneershelvam: co-founder and CTO of Phaidra; one of the original engineers on the AlphaGo project

      <title>Fireworks Founder Lin Qiao on How Fast Inference and Small Models Will Benefit Businesses</title>
      <description>In the first wave of the generative AI revolution, startups and enterprises built on top of the best closed-source models available, mostly from OpenAI. The AI customer journey moves from training to inference, and as these first products find PMF, many are hitting a wall on latency and cost.

Fireworks Founder and CEO Lin Qiao led the PyTorch team at Meta that rebuilt the whole stack to meet the complex needs of the world’s largest B2C company. Meta moved PyTorch to its own non-profit foundation in 2022 and Lin started Fireworks with the mission to compress the timeframe of training and inference and democratize access to GenAI beyond the hyperscalers to let a diversity of AI applications thrive.

Lin predicts when open and closed source models will converge and reveals her goal to build simple API access to the totality of knowledge.

Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital 

Mentioned in this episode:


Pytorch: the leading framework for building deep learning models, originated at Meta and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella


Caffe2 and ONNX: ML frameworks Meta used that PyTorch eventually replaced


Conservation of complexity: the idea that that every computer application has inherent complexity that cannot be reduced but merely moved between the backend and frontend, originated by Xerox PARC researcher Larry Tesler 


Mixture of Experts: a class of transformer models that route requests between different subsets of a model based on use case


Fathom: a product the Fireworks team uses for video conference summarization 


LMSYS Chatbot Arena: crowdsourced open platform for LLM evals hosted on Hugging Face

      <title>GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke on Building Copilot, and the the Future of Software Development</title>
      <description>GithHub invented collaborative coding and in the process changed how open source projects, startups and eventually enterprises write code. GitHub Copilot is the first blockbuster product built on top of OpenAI’s GPT models. It now accounts for more than 40 percent of GitHub revenue growth for an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion. Copilot itself is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018.

We talk to CEO Thomas Dohmke about how a small team at GitHub built on top of GPT-3 and quickly created a product that developers love—and can’t live without. Thomas describes how the product has grown from simple autocomplete to a fully featured workspace for enterprise teams. He also believes that tools like Copilot will bring the power of coding to a billion developers by 2030.

Hosted by: Stephanie Zhan and Sonya Huang, Sequoia Capital 

Mentioned in this episode:


Nat Friedman: Former Microsoft VP (and now investor) who came up with the idea that Microsoft should buy GitHub


Oege de Moor: Github developer (and now founder of XBOW) who came up with the idea of using GPT-3 for code and went on to create Copilot


Alex Graveley: principal engineer and Chief Architect for Copilot (now CEO of Minion.ai) who came up with the name Copilot (because his boss, Nat Firedman, is an amateur pilot)

We spoke with Joe just two days after the model’s release to ask what’s new, what it enables, and how Meta sees the role of open source in the AI ecosystem.

Joe shares that where Llama 3.1 405B really focused is on pushing scale (it was trained on 15 trillion tokens using 16,000 GPUs) and he’s excited about the zero-shot tool use it will enable, as well as its role in distillation and generating synthetic data to teach smaller models. He tells us why he thinks even frontier models will ultimately commoditize—and why that’s a good thing for the startup ecosystem.

      <title>Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski on Getting AI to Do the Work of 700 Customer Service Reps</title>
      <description>In February, Sebastian Siemiatkowski boldly announced that Klarna’s new OpenAI-powered assistant handled two thirds of the Swedish fintech’s customer service chats in its first month. Not only were customer satisfaction metrics better, but by replacing 700 full-time contractors the bottom line impact is projected to be $40M. Since then, every company we talk to wants to know, “How do we get the Klarna customer support thing?”

Co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski tells us how the Klarna team shipped this new product in record time—and how embracing AI internally with an experimental mindset is transforming the company. He discusses how AI development is proliferating inside the company, from customer support to marketing to internal knowledge to customer-facing experiences. 

Sebastian also reflects on the impacts of AI on employment, society, and the arts while encouraging lawmakers to be open minded about the benefits.

Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital 

Mentioned in this episode:
DeepL: Language translation app that Sebastian says makes 10,000 translators in Brussels redundant
The Klarna brand: The offbeat optimism that the company is now augmenting with AI
Neo4j: The graph database management system that Klarna is using to build Kiki, their internal knowledge base

00:00 Introduction
01:57 Klarna’s business
03:00 Pitching OpenAI
08:51 How we built this
10:46 Will Klara ever completely replace its CS team with AI?
14:22 The benefits
17:25 If you had a policy magic wand…
21:12 What jobs will be most affected by AI?
23:58 How about marketing?
27:55 How creative are LLMs?
30:11 Klarna’s knowledge graph, Kiki
33:10 Reducing the number of enterprise systems
35:24 Build vs buy?
39:59 What’s next for Klarna with AI?

      <title>Reflection AI’s Misha Laskin on the AlphaGo Moment for LLMs</title>
      <description>LLMs are democratizing digital intelligence, but we’re all waiting for AI agents to take this to the next level by planning tasks and executing actions to actually transform the way we work and live our lives. 

Yet despite incredible hype around AI agents, we’re still far from that “tipping point” with best in class models today. As one measure: coding agents are now scoring in the high-teens % on the SWE-bench benchmark for resolving GitHub issues, which far exceeds the previous unassisted baseline of 2% and the assisted baseline of 5%, but we’ve still got a long way to go.

Why is that? What do we need to truly unlock agentic capability for LLMs? What can we learn from researchers who have built both the most powerful agents in the world, like AlphaGo, and the most powerful LLMs in the world? 

To find out, we’re talking to Misha Laskin, former research scientist at DeepMind. Misha is embarking on his vision to build the best agent models by bringing the search capabilities of RL together with LLMs at his new company, Reflection AI. He and his cofounder Ioannis Antonoglou, co-creator of AlphaGo and AlphaZero and RLHF lead for Gemini, are leveraging their unique insights to train the most reliable models for developers building agentic workflows.

      <title>Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott on How Far Scaling Laws Will Extend</title>
      <description>The current LLM era is the result of scaling the size of models in successive waves (and the compute to train them). It is also the result of better-than-Moore’s-Law price vs performance ratios in each new generation of Nvidia GPUs. The largest platform companies are continuing to invest in scaling as the prime driver of AI innovation.

Are they right, or will marginal returns level off soon, leaving hyperscalers with too much hardware and too few customer use cases? To find out, we talk to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott who has led their AI strategy for the past seven years. Scott describes himself as a “short-term pessimist, long-term optimist” and he sees the scaling trend as durable for the industry and critical for the establishment of Microsoft’s AI platform.

Scott believes there will be a shift across the compute ecosystem from training to inference as the frontier models continue to improve, serving wider and more reliable use cases. He also discusses the coming business models for training data, and even what ad units might look like for autonomous agents.

Hosted by: Pat Grady and Bill Coughran, Sequoia Capital

Mentioned:
BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, the 2018 Google paper that convinced Kevin that Microsoft wasn’t moving fast enough on AI. 
Dennard scaling: The scaling law that describes the proportional relationship between transistor size and power use; has not held since 2012 and is often confused with Moore’s Law.
Textbooks Are All You Need: Microsoft paper that introduces a new large language model for code, phi-1, that achieves smaller size by using higher quality “textbook” data.
GPQA and MMLU: Benchmarks for reasoning
Copilot: Microsoft product line of GPT consumer assistants from general productivity to design, vacation planning, cooking and fitness.
Devin: Autonomous AI code agent from Cognition Labs that Microsoft recently announced a partnership with.
Ray Solomonoff: Participant in the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence that named the field; Kevin admires his prescience about the importance of probabilistic methods decades before anyone else.

      <itunes:summary>The current LLM era is the result of scaling the size of models in successive waves (and the compute to train them). It is also the result of better-than-Moore’s-Law price vs performance ratios in each new generation of Nvidia GPUs. The largest platform companies are continuing to invest in scaling as the prime driver of AI innovation.

Are they right, or will marginal returns level off soon, leaving hyperscalers with too much hardware and too few customer use cases? To find out, we talk to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott who has led their AI strategy for the past seven years. Scott describes himself as a “short-term pessimist, long-term optimist” and he sees the scaling trend as durable for the industry and critical for the establishment of Microsoft’s AI platform.

Scott believes there will be a shift across the compute ecosystem from training to inference as the frontier models continue to improve, serving wider and more reliable use cases. He also discusses the coming business models for training data, and even what ad units might look like for autonomous agents.

Mentioned:
BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, the 2018 Google paper that convinced Kevin that Microsoft wasn’t moving fast enough on AI. 
Dennard scaling: The scaling law that describes the proportional relationship between transistor size and power use; has not held since 2012 and is often confused with Moore’s Law.
Textbooks Are All You Need: Microsoft paper that introduces a new large language model for code, phi-1, that achieves smaller size by using higher quality “textbook” data.
GPQA and MMLU: Benchmarks for reasoning
Copilot: Microsoft product line of GPT consumer assistants from general productivity to design, vacation planning, cooking and fitness.
Devin: Autonomous AI code agent from Cognition Labs that Microsoft recently announced a partnership with.
Ray Solomonoff: Participant in the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence that named the field; Kevin admires his prescience about the importance of probabilistic methods decades before anyone else.

      <title>Zapier’s Mike Knoop launches ARC Prize to Jumpstart New Ideas for AGI</title>
      <description>As impressive as LLMs are, the growing consensus is that language, scale and compute won’t get us to AGI. Although many AI benchmarks have quickly achieved human-level performance, there is one eval that has barely budged since it was created in 2019.

Google researcher François Chollet wrote a paper that year defining intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency—the ability to learn new skills as humans do, from a small number of examples. To make it testable he proposed a new benchmark, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), designed to be easy for humans, but hard for AI. Notably, it doesn’t rely on language.

Zapier co-founder Mike Knoop read Chollet’s paper as the LLM wave was rising. He worked quickly to integrate generative AI into Zapier’s product, but kept coming back to the lack of progress on the ARC benchmark. In June, Knoop and Chollet launched the ARC Prize, a public competition offering more than $1M to beat and open-source a solution to the ARC-AGI eval.

In this episode Mike talks about the new ideas required to solve ARC, shares updates from the first two weeks of the competition, and shares why he’s excited for AGI systems that can innovate alongside humans.

      <title>Factory’s Matan Grinberg and Eno Reyes Unleash the Droids on Software Development</title>
      <description>Archimedes said that with a large enough lever, you can move the world. For decades, software engineering has been that lever. And now, AI is compounding that lever. How will we use AI to apply 100 or 1000x leverage to the greatest lever to move the world?

Matan Grinberg and Eno Reyes, co-founders of Factory, have chosen to do things differently than many of their peers in this white-hot space. They sell a fleet of “Droids,” purpose-built dev agents which accomplish different tasks in the software development lifecycle (like code review, testing, pull requests or writing code). Rather than training their own foundation model, their approach is to build something useful for engineering orgs today on top of the rapidly improving models, aligning with the developer and evolving with them. 

Matan and Eno are optimistic about the effects of autonomy in software development and on building a company in the application layer. Their advice to founders, “The only way you can win is by executing faster and being more obsessed.”

      <title>LangChain’s Harrison Chase on Building the Orchestration Layer for AI Agents </title>
      <description>Last year, AutoGPT and Baby AGI captured our imaginations—agents quickly became the buzzword of the day…and then things went quiet. AutoGPT and Baby AGI may have marked a peak in the hype cycle, but this year has seen a wave of agentic breakouts on the product side, from Klarna’s customer support AI to Cognition’s Devin, etc.

Harrison Chase of LangChain is focused on enabling the orchestration layer for agents. In this conversation, he explains what’s changed that’s allowing agents to improve performance and find traction. 

Harrison shares what he’s optimistic about, where he sees promise for agents vs. what he thinks will be trained into models themselves, and discusses novel kinds of UX that he imagines might transform how we experience agents in the future.     

Hosted by: Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, Sequoia Capital

Mentioned: 


ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models, the first cognitive architecture for agents


SWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering, small-model open-source software engineering agent from researchers at Princeton


Devin, autonomous software engineering from Cognition


V0: Generative UI agent from Vercel


GPT Researcher, a research agent 


Language Model Cascades: 2022 paper by Google Brain and now OpenAI researcher David Dohan that was influential for Harrison in developing LangChain
