    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/995575/open_sms">Send us a text</a></p><p>In this episode, host Aaron Moncur interviews Bradley Rothenberg about nTopology and its unique approach to computational design and engineering software. Bradley discusses the origins of nTopology and how it differs from traditional CAD tools. He explains how nTopology captures requirements in algorithms rather than geometry definitions. Bradley also covers nTopology’s applications in additive manufacturing and its tight integration with simulation tools.</p><p>Main Topics:</p><ul><li>The founding of Ntopology and Bradley&apos;s background </li><li>Computational design approach vs traditional CAD modeling</li><li>Implicit modeling technology and sign distance fields</li><li>Applications in additive manufacturing and complex geometries</li><li>Integration with simulation tools like ANSYS and LS-DYNA</li><li>Process for exporting/importing models with other CAD systems</li><li>Determining when Ntopology is the right solution</li></ul><p>About the guest: Bradley Rothenberg is the founder and CEO of nTopology, a company pioneering next-generation engineering software for advanced manufacturing. Launched in 2015, nTopology enables engineers to create complex, optimized geometries, primarily for sectors like aerospace, automotive, and medical devices. With a background in architecture from Pratt Institute, Brad brings a unique perspective to computational design, bridging the gap between form and functionality in additive manufacturing.<br/><br/></p><p>Links:<br/><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradleyrothenberg/'>Bradley Rothenberg - LinkedIn<br/></a><a href='https://www.ntop.com/'>nTopology Website</a></p><p>🚀 <b>Join Us at PDX 2025!</b> 🚀</p><p>PDX 2025 is the&nbsp; <b>Product Development Expo</b> designed for engineers who want hands-on training from industry experts.
