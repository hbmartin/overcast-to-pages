                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Creativity is often believed to be a uniquely human trait, but what happens when artificial intelligence starts to blur the line between human imagination and machine innovation? For this month’s episode, we are joined by four extraordinary guests who are shaping the intersection of art, design, and technology. Together, we dive into how AI reshapes creative fields, from personalized design to algorithmic music. Can machines truly cocreate, or are they just mirroring us? And what does this mean for the future of artistic expression? Join us as we explore these thought-provoking questions on the Harvard Data Science Review Podcast.</p>
<p>Our guests:</p>
<ul>
<li>CJ and Zack formed the music hacker duo<a href='https://dadabots.com/'> DADABOTS</a> when attending Berklee College of Music. From playing in metal, punk, and noise bands and studying composition and programming, they realized machine learning was an even more extreme way to make sound and dove completely into eliminating themselves from music. They cofounded <a href='https://www.harmonai.org/'>Harmonai</a>, the music research team within Stability AI focused on creating open-source generative AI audio tools, and created<a href='https://stability.ai/stable-audio'> Stable Audio</a>, which was listed in TIME Magazine's best inventions of 2023</li>
<li>Nini Hu, designer and art director with over 20 years of experience working with global fashion lifestyle brands and author of<a href='https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.2c5ec0ca'> AI and Creativity</a> for HDSR. Nini is also the founder of &amp;HER, building customizable bras using AI, eco-friendly fibers, and automated production technology. &amp;HER uses machine learning models to bring body shape and measurements directly to production.</li>
<li>Portrait XO, independent researcher and award-winning multimodal artist who researches computational creativity, human-machine collaboration, and explores new formats and applications through innovative audio and visual projects.  </li>

For this month’s episode, we are joined by four extraordinary guests who are shaping the intersection of art, design, and technology. Together, we dive into how AI reshapes creative fields, from personalized design to algorithmic music. Can machines truly cocreate, or are they just mirroring us? And what does this mean for the future of artistic expression? Join us as we explore these thought-provoking questions on the <em>Harvard Data Science Review </em>Podcast.</p>
<p>Our guests:</p>
<ul>
<li>CJ and Zack formed the music hacker duo<a href='https://dadabots.com/'> DADABOTS</a> when attending Berklee College of Music. From playing in metal, punk, and noise bands and studying composition and programming, they realized machine learning was an even more extreme way to make sound and dove completely into eliminating themselves from music. They cofounded <a href='https://www.harmonai.org/'>Harmonai</a>, the music research team within Stability AI focused on creating open-source generative AI audio tools, and created<a href='https://stability.ai/stable-audio'> Stable Audio</a>, which was listed in <em>TIME Magazine</em>'s best inventions of 2023</li>
<li>Nini Hu, designer and art director with over 20 years of experience working with global fashion lifestyle brands and author of<a href='https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.2c5ec0ca'> AI and Creativity</a> for <em>HDSR. </em>Nini is also the founder of &amp;HER, building customizable bras using AI, eco-friendly fibers, and automated production technology. &amp;HER uses machine learning models to bring body shape and measurements directly to production.</li>

This update impacted approximately 8.5 million systems, triggering outages across various sectors, including airlines, banks, stock markets, and even government emergency services. Even once activity was restored, threat actors sought to take advantage of the situation through phishing schemes and other cyberattacks.  Though caused by an internal error rather than malicious intent, incidents like CrowdStrike’s outage underscore the growing importance of reliable security measures on technologies that impact daily life. On this month’s podcast, we explore the ins and outs of cybersecurity, how cyberattacks occur, and what steps you can take to protect your data.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, police departments nationwide have increasingly embraced data and AI tools to enhance their crime prevention, investigation, and conviction efforts. These technologies range from image analysis on body cameras to license plate trackers predicting potential involvement in drug trafficking. However, a crucial question arises: Are these technologies both accurate and fair? Is law enforcement adequately trained to utilize them effectively? Is legislation adapting swiftly enough to keep pace with these transformative changes?</p>
<p>On today’s episode we engage in a conversation with a professor of law and a police chief who together provide us insights into the evolving landscape of policing technologies. </p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 2022, the sports analytics sector was valued at 2.98 billion USD and is expected to grow to 22.13 billion USD by 2030, at a CARG of 28.7% (source). In today's episode, we do a deep dive into this rapidly growing field from both industry and academic perspectives. What metrics do companies and researchers use to predict the next big winner? How are statistical tools and modeling applied differently to measure an individual player’s performance versus that of a team? How does an aspiring data scientist break into the sports analytics industry? We explore these questions and more with the help of  two experts. Listen now!
Our guests:
Dr. Mark Glickman, senior lecturer on statistics and head of the Sports Analytics Laboratory at Harvard University

<p>Protecting the data privacy of survey respondents has always been a central consideration for the U.S Census Bureau, and throughout its history, many methods have been developed and implemented. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau adopted a new form of privacy protection—differential privacy which was received with mixed reaction. To further understand why the Census Bureau adopted this new form of privacy protection and to help explore the concerns raised about differential privacy, we invited two experts who represent both sides of the debate and who each contributed to the Harvard Data Science Review <a href='https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/specialissue2'>special issue on the 2020 U.S. Census</a>.</p>

We are constantly being influenced and seduced by these algorithms and the humans who designed them. On this month’s HDSR podcast we examine the pros and cons of recommender systems as well as the art, passion, and creativity that can be lost when we rely too heavily on them. </p>
<p>Our expert guests are Dr. Pearl Pu, the leading data scientist on recommender systems and a senior scientist at the Faculty of Information and Communication Sciences at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and film-maker Brandt Andersen whose most recent film, Refugee about a Syrian doctor’s escape from her war torn country, was short-listed for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short in 2020.</p>

How do they factor in the decisions made every day by state and federal courts concerning bail, sentencing, and parole? Are black box algorithms fair and unbiased? Do they help counteract or support societal prejudices?  Is their use in criminal justice cases serving the public’s best interest? </p>
<p>We discuss these issues and more with two experts on the topic: Cynthia Rudin, Professor of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Statistical Science, Mathematics, and Biostatistics & Bioinformatics and Director of the Interpretable Machine Learning Lab at Duke University and Brandon Garrett, Professor of Law and founder of the Wilson Center for Science and Justice at Duke University.</p>

We discuss the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of this topic including privacy issues, the 2020 U.S. Census, how well-intended methods may adversely affect minority populations, and why it’s important for local communities to collect and report their own data. We also ask how transparent should the federal government be about its data collection and who should the public be most worried about when it comes to data privacy?</p>
<p>Our guests are Tim Persons, Chief Scientist for the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Managing Director of its Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics team and Julia Lane, New York University professor and co-founder of the Coleridge Initiative, a not-for-profit organization that is working with governments to ensure that data are more effectively used for public decision-making.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode we explore all things AI with our guests Kathleen Walch and Ron Schmelzer, hosts of the popular AI Today podcast and principal analysts and managing partners of Cognilytica, an AI research and advisory firm.</p>
<p>With Kathleen and Ron, we discuss the spread of AI in our lives, from autonomous vehicles to Taco Bell’s new automatic drive thru lanes. But has too much been promised and not delivered? Are we on the brink of an AI winter, where development and investment cool down? We look at all the possibilities of how our future will change with AI. </p>
