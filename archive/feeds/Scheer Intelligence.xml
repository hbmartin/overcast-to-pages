                    <p dir="ltr">The wildfires in Los Angeles county have brought a multitude of difficult and prevailing questions to the forefront of the region as well as the system of capitalism. Joining host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast is Jacobin Magazine columnist Ben Burgis to discuss writer Mike Davis and how his book, &ldquo;The Ecology&nbsp;of Fear:&nbsp;Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster,&rdquo; (February 1998) serves as a kind of prognosis for everything going wrong in Los Angeles today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two dissect the multitude of issues at play in the wildfire disasters: the conceit of real estate developers testing the limits of nature, the passive and active exploitation of the working class to make and now handle the disaster, the greed of for-profit insurance companies cancelling policies, and the decisions by a major county like Los Angeles in foregoing budgets to handle these inevitable disasters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Burgis asks, &ldquo;If the public is just frankly going to be on the hook for it, do we, in fact, need to be building this densely in areas this prone to fire?

                    <p dir="ltr">The American saber-rattling against China has been increasing almost as fast as China&rsquo;s own development in the past few years. China&rsquo;s economic prosperity and international influence is undeniable yet American politicians continue to treat their rise as a threat to their global hegemony. Joining host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence is Megan Russell, a writer, academic and CODEPINK's China is Not Our Enemy Campaign Coordinator.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scheer is quick to point out the intergenerational dynamic between his own work on China as a fellow in the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s and Russell&rsquo;s recent experience living in China and studying in Shanghai. Both witnessed and experienced the American perspective of China and how it has continued to undermine it. Scheer and Russell focus on her latest article, which calls out New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman for his portrayal of China and how his deficient op-ed mirrors the broader perception of China in the United States. While many may think that China is an authoritarian country with people living under the heel of Xi Jinping, the actual material conditions of its population are often left out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Something [people] don't talk about enough, in my opinion, is how China managed to eradicate extreme poverty. And that's not just a minimum income level, it also means access to food, to clothes, healthcare, clean housing, free education. It means infrastructure, means functioning systems,&rdquo; Russell says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People also point to working conditions and the outsourcing of American jobs to China as a means of attacking them. To this, Russell explains, &ldquo;All China has done is use the system in place to develop and try to provide opportunities to its incredibly vast population, while still maintaining its proto-socialist policies. It's us that has exported the production of all our goods to make a few more dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, the US stands to lose, not only in a trade war, but also in the climate aspect, since China has also made great strides towards combatting the climate crisis. Russell cites their plan of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 and tells Scheer, &ldquo;China has really undergone this internal green energy revolution, doing far more than any other country to combat climate change.&rdquo;</p>

It means infrastructure, means functioning systems,&rdquo; Russell says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People also point to working conditions and the outsourcing of American jobs to China as a means of attacking them. To this, Russell explains, &ldquo;All China has done is use the system in place to develop and try to provide opportunities to its incredibly vast population, while still maintaining its proto-socialist policies. It's us that has exported the production of all our goods to make a few more dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, the US stands to lose, not only in a trade war, but also in the climate aspect, since China has also made great strides towards combatting the climate crisis. Russell cites their plan of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 and tells Scheer, &ldquo;China has really undergone this internal green energy revolution, doing far more than any other country to combat climate change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the past 33 Christmas holidays, Kevin Cooper has inhabited an 11-by-4 &frac12;-foot cell in California's San Quentin State Prison,&nbsp;the last&nbsp;eight&nbsp;waiting for&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;to grant him a new hearing&nbsp;and&nbsp;advanced DNA testing&nbsp;that would&nbsp;support what&nbsp;federal Appellate&nbsp;Judge&nbsp;William C.&nbsp;Fletcher&nbsp;has&nbsp;said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Kevin Cooper is on Death Row because the San Bernardino sheriff&rsquo;s department framed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cooper explains how he has kept hope alive when he could so easily succumb to desperation and despair.&nbsp; He paints, writes and reads voraciously but is most passionate when speaking out against the death penalty:&nbsp;"When you find yourself in a fight that is bigger than you&mdash;[capital punishment] affects the lives of many people&mdash;and you can do something to help in that fight, you can&rsquo;t give up...You can&rsquo;t stop, you can&rsquo;t quit. You just can&rsquo;t do it...I did not choose this, to speak out against the death penalty; I didn&rsquo;t. This [struggle] chose me."</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Much needed attention has been brought upon the for-profit health insurance industry in the wake of the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Personal stories about people&rsquo;s tragic experiences involving not only UnitedHealthcare but many other insurance companies have spelled out a deeper issue that resonates across the American political spectrum.</p>
<p>Sean Morrow, a journalist and writer for More Perfect Union&mdash;a nonprofit newsroom that focuses on working class issues&mdash;has gained significant attention lately as a result of the shooting. Morrow joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence to further elaborate on the issues millions of Americans are facing and why Brian Thompson&rsquo;s assassination led to such a widespread public reaction.</p>
<p>Morrow dives into some of his reporting, which has dealt with the internal processes behind the health insurance system. Among insurance companies, there is a consolidation process in the form of vertical integration. Companies like UnitedHealthcare can own multiple parts of the healthcare process and thus set up toll booths along each route people can expect to take. &ldquo;They'll have pharmacy benefit manager companies, they'll have data companies, and then they kind of own this entire system, so that they're always routing you through there,&rdquo; Morrow says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a health issue, you could theoretically be giving UnitedHealthcare a little bit of money from every step of the process. And they're their own vendors in all of that,&rdquo; he explains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The system's not broken. The system's working as it's intended,&rdquo; Morrow tells Scheer. The system, Morrow says, is intended &ldquo;to funnel more and more money to a certain handful of people at the cost of all others.&rdquo; Despite the legality of this system, the rigging of it against the interests of the working class is what enables their suffering as well as their anger against it.</p>

                    <div class="content clearfix">
<p dir="ltr">The assassination of Brian Thompson, the former CEO of UnitedHealthcare insurance company, has prompted a national reckoning of how corporate entities commit crimes on a daily basis and are not only not punished but rewarded for their profit-making prowess. Many point to Luigi Mangione, the alleged assassin, as an example of vigilante justice, murdering someone who is responsible for the deaths of thousands who are denied medical care.</p>
<p>Joining host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence is Anthony Grasso, professor of political science at Rutgers University and author of the new book, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dual-Justice-Divergent-Approaches-Corporate/dp/0226835596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Dual-Justice-Divergent-Approaches-Corporate/dp/0226835596&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1734132636375000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YaLktWeBVjskktzLIVkfY">Dual Justice: America&rsquo;s Divergent Approaches to Street and Corporate Crime</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book, published a day before the assassination, dives into how the justice system is really set up in two separate ways which Grasso describes as &ldquo;poor people, people of color, we want to crack down on them.&rdquo; But as Donald Trump puts it, when he doesn&rsquo;t pay his taxes, he&rsquo;s not a criminal, he&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>The criminal justice system fails ordinary people by bypassing the criminal activity occurring in corporate boardrooms. &ldquo;A lot of corporate actions that are legalized or regulated, things like denials of life saving medical care that companies make in pursuit of profit maximization,&rdquo; Grasso says. &ldquo;We don't understand these things as crimes. We say these are byproducts of business decision making.</p>
<p>It comes down to the U.S. being rooted in the principles of capitalism and how those with the wealth and power to be in positions that affect the lives of thousands can harm them as long as they follow the rules. &ldquo;You can prioritize profit maximization over human life. You can deny people coverage because it increases shareholder value maximization,&rdquo; Grasso tells Scheer. &ldquo;Those things are okay, as long as you're doing it within the regulatory confines we give you."</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Though one can debate the reasons, statistics and precedent of nuclear war, what is often left out of the conversation is the reality of it: destruction of the world as a whole. In her new immersive art experience titled, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.lenaherzog.com/awaetr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lenaherzog.com/awaetr&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1733524268773000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kVhPGNQDcNcyb8LfBpwNv">Any War, Any Enemy</a>,&rdquo; immersive artist Lena Herzog throws this reality literally right in the faces of viewers. The film can uniquely be experienced via virtual reality as well as a traditional screen and it plainly shows what nuclear war looks like.</p>
<p>Herzog begins the film with a quote stating nuclear war is not war. She tells host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence that she begins with this because &ldquo;the word &lsquo;war&rsquo; is disorienting, because in war, you can have a battle, you can lose a battle, you can win a war. You cannot win a nuclear exchange. It's omnicide. It's not war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of a trilogy which tries to invoke art in a novel form, the film follows "Last Whispers," another piece of immersive art that focuses on the destruction of language. For &ldquo;Any War, Any Enemy,&rdquo; Herzog wants people to &ldquo;experience [nuclear war] inside the frame, to feel it in the fiber of your being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Scheer, the film&rsquo;s power comes from viscerally showing the reality most people have no idea will happen in the event of a nuclear war. &ldquo;You are forced to be immersed into an environment where your voice means nothing, your brain means nothing, your eyes mean nothing, because this weapon has destroyed any means of sustaining life,&rdquo; Scheer says. &ldquo;So you are these figures floating around in the water dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foreign policy discussions centering around the U.S., Russia, China, Israel and others become moot points as Herzog points out, &ldquo;This is a question of existence versus nonexistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scheer and Herzog agree that the time for nuclear disarmament is now. As opposed to the middle of the 20th century with the Cuban Missile Crisis, where leaders had hours and days to talk about any provocations and would actually speak to one another. Nowadays, leaders avoid each other and the response time to any kind of strike, Herzog says, &ldquo;it's 90 seconds. It's four minutes.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Gaza today symbolizes nothing but death, destruction and oppression. Israel&rsquo;s genocide and scorched earth bombing campaign has not only wiped out its people but the rich history that stretches back thousands of years. Juan Cole, University of Michigan history professor and renowned Middle East historian, joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to clearly lay out the history behind Gaza through his newest book, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKZXR6JP?crid=DWAP8N9I3ILM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qsOHj3TEurbghfm-SVBWVwNdbSwyReWBod3J3GrEqSLGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.sNN2YmuGu19gOzz_5nTGhpklV_YofGSTY2tOuMdN9HA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Juan+cole+gaza&amp;qid=1729912218&amp;sprefix=juan+cole+gaza%2Caps%2C123&amp;sr=8-1#customerReviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKZXR6JP?crid%3DDWAP8N9I3ILM%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qsOHj3TEurbghfm-SVBWVwNdbSwyReWBod3J3GrEqSLGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.sNN2YmuGu19gOzz_5nTGhpklV_YofGSTY2tOuMdN9HA%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3DJuan%2Bcole%2Bgaza%26qid%3D1729912218%26sprefix%3Djuan%2Bcole%2Bgaza%252Caps%252C123%26sr%3D8-1%23customerReviews&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732307120272000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2tXIBW1-MfcsjZ2cnigR8w">Gaza Yet Stands</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaza, Cole says, was a cosmopolitan place, a place people went through for travel, trade and its rich civilization. &ldquo;If you were in Beirut and you wanted to go to Cairo by land, you would go through Gaza. It was a crossroads,&rdquo; Cole tells Scheer. A unique, multinational city with diverse religious significance, Gaza used to represent something grand in the heart of the Middle East. Today, after it was stolen by Israel and Western colonialism, even the history is in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The Palestinians were 1.3 million, and the British envisaged in the White Paper of 1939 that they'd make a state of Palestine in which the Jews would be a substantial minority,&rdquo; Cole explains. &ldquo;It would be a Palestine, just as the British Mandate of Iraq eventuated in the country of Iraq, and the French mandate of Syria eventuated in the country of Syria, there would be a Palestine.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This arrangement, Cole contends, was uncomfortable for all parties involved and made things worse in each affected region. Many of the Jews persecuted in the Holocaust were now destined to repatriate to this foreign land instead of to Poland and Germany, which displaced the Palestinians and welcomed havoc from settlers. In a world emerging from colonial rule following World War II, Cole explains that Israel&rsquo;s creation was just a reversion back to that model. &ldquo;That's what Israel is, it's a Western colonial instrument,&rdquo; Cole says. &ldquo;What's been done to the Palestinians is considered extremely unfair by almost everybody in the world, outside of Western Europe and the United States.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">The election came and went, and despite Democrats&rsquo; heavy emphasis on abortion rights, the election of Donald Trump makes it clear that the rights of women across the country are in grave danger. Joining host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence to spell out this danger and talk about his new book, &ldquo;Abortion in the Age of Unreason: A Doctor's Account of Caring for Women Before and After Roe v. Wade&rdquo; is &ldquo;America's Abortion Doctor&rdquo; Dr. Warren Hern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hern possesses vast experience with abortion and abortion rights, from his days at the first private nonprofit abortion clinic in Colorado in 1973 to his having to shield himself behind bulletproof windows today as a response to the violent right-wing anti-abortion protests in America.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;There's no debate in abortion. It's a civil war. The anti-abortion people have assassinated five of my medical colleagues, including one of my best friends, Dr. George Tiller, and I'm on all the hit lists,&rdquo; Hern tells Scheer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Abortion goes beyond politics, Hern argues. He states plainly that politicians have no right to be involved in the decision-making process behind abortions: &ldquo;This is a medical issue. Politicians should get the hell out of this, and we should have a constitutional right to a safe abortion.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hern likens abortion to a medical condition, and women should always have the fundamental right to choose how to treat themselves. &ldquo;What my point has been since 1970 [is] that the treatment of choice for pregnancy is abortion unless the woman wants to have a baby,&rdquo; Hern says. &ldquo;There is no justification for any law or any restriction on access to safe abortion services as part of medical care. Safe abortion is a fundamental and essential component of medical care for women.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Reporting on the election often involves being glued to computer screens dictating the polling numbers around the country and using statistics revolving around race and gender to make assumptions about how the country is politically swaying. Journalist and online host Michael Tracey actually went out to many prominent swing states throughout the election and spoke to various swaths of voters, engaging in what their vote really means and how ordinary Americans view newly appointed Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Tracey joins Scheer Intelligence host Robert Scheer to discuss the election, why Trump won and what his second term holds for the future of the country and the globe. On the side of foreign policy, Tracey says people ought to be wary of Trump&rsquo;s peace rhetoric and look at his record as president. &ldquo;Although Trump was seen as in conflict with the so-called neocons in 2016, he then undertook a foreign policy in which he escalated virtually every conflict that he inherited,&rdquo; Tracey tells Scheer.</p>
<p>Tracey cites regime change in Venezuela, trouble with Iran and bolstering NATO. When it comes to domestic issues and why the US went for Trump in such a grand way, Tracey points to the failures of the Democrats to appeal to common voters, pay attention to the issues they truly care about and allowed them to succumb to Trump&rsquo;s everyman rhetoric, despite what he might actually do once in office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is deficient about [the Democrats&rsquo;] own messaging, it has alienated such wide swaths of people who, in earlier eras, would have been considered squarely within their coalition,&rdquo; Tracey asserts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, the Democrats parading around people like Liz Cheney and ignoring crucial issues like the genocide in Palestine hurt them, as was proven through the popular vote. Tracey indicts their strategy: &ldquo;Liberalism is so oriented itself around the personage of Trump that it's kind of been given a free pass from defining itself on its own terms.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Amidst the hype, excitement and nervousness of the election, the bigger picture of what the United States is and how it operates often gets lost on people. Many think that choosing one or another candidate will significantly alter their future to better represent their values, but in reality there is only one group of people that matter the most: those who Dr. Peter Phillips, professor emeritus at Sonoma State University, calls the &ldquo;titans of capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In his <a href="https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4674-titans-of-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4674-titans-of-capital&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730504274318000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1j5O0kHV4ZlfuEpl8u6iVf">new book</a>&nbsp;by the same name, Phillips studies the economic trends following the COVID-19 pandemic and how the wealth concentration in the world took a dramatic turn towards the already ultra-wealthy. He joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence to further analyze these trends and how dire inequality is becoming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The main problem is simple to understand: the ultra-wealthy &ldquo;doubled their wealth concentration.&rdquo; That means, according to Phillips, that &ldquo;the upper one half of 1% of the people got richer and basically, the rest of the world got poorer.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Phillips names the top 10 capital investment companies, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Morgan Stanley and others as the main culprits. Over $50 trillion are controlled by 117 people across these 10 companies, according to Phillips.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This immense concentration of wealth inevitably renders any semblance of democracy almost useless, as the main decision makers are those who hold the biggest bag. &ldquo;Whoever we elect as President is not going to make any difference because they're managed by capital,&rdquo; Phillips tells Scheer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;They're there to protect global capital. That's what the American political system is about. That's what the political systems in the West are about. They see capital as a vital interest of the West, and that's why we have military bases all over the world to protect capital and to ensure that debts get repaid and that this capital continues to grow and expand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joining host Robert Scheer on this week&rsquo;s Scheer Intelligence are two people who dedicated their recent film, &ldquo;Food and Country,&rdquo; to understanding this process behind food in the United States and how big business, as usual, has almost complete control of the system. Renowned former food critic for the La Times and New York Times, former editor of Gourmet magazine, author of cookbooks and memoirs and PBS food guru, Ruth Reichl and film director Laura Gabbert discuss some of the key takeaways from the film.</p>
<p>Gabbert asserts that big agriculture&rsquo;s firm grasp on the industry is where the problems begin. Its lobby is amongst the biggest and Gabbert explains that there is no incentive to try and remedy the problems that come from this monopolization of an industry so essential to human survival. &ldquo;I think that is really the crux of the whole problem, is money in politics,&rdquo; Gabbert says.</p>
<p>Reichl takes it back to what happened after World War II and how the U.S. government made an attempt to fight communism by cheapening the food making process, which turned farms into factories. &ldquo;Almost everything that's wrong with America comes from that policy. We've destroyed our health, our environment, our communities,&rdquo; Reichl tells Scheer.</p>
<p>The heart of their story lies with the farmers themselves, and how, despite being in charge of the most important aspect of human survival, they still tend to struggle the most in society. Reichl explains their significance in the film, stating, &ldquo;I just wanted for us to be able to listen to their stories that they tell themselves about what has happened to them and what the American system has done to them.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">In the 365 days following the events of Oct. 7, the situation in the Middle East is as complicated as ever. Israel&rsquo;s genocide in Gaza agonizingly continues, and its invasion of Lebanon and subsequent retaliation at the hands of Hezbollah and Iran has added more fuel to the fire. Tensions are escalating and Middle East expert and writer Juan Cole joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to explain its precedent and what the future may hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The extremism of the Netanyahu cabinet in Israel, Cole explains, is the basis for the sharp increase in violence and tension in the region. While the Israeli government justifies their actions as necessary for the protection of Jews in the region, Cole argues their actions do the opposite. &ldquo;The extreme goals of Netanyahu to completely control the lives of people in Gaza and the West Bank and Lebanon are endangering the lives of ordinary Jews. They're not making them safer,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attempted expansion into Lebanon, which has brought global attention to the country, is something seen before in the recent history of Israel, Cole says. &ldquo;It's 1982 all over again. 1982 was an enormous failure, and it produced more radicalization and more headaches in the long term for Israel,&rdquo; he tells Scheer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite their claims of self-defense against &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; organizations like Hezbollah, Cole explains that much like Hamas, Hezbollah&rsquo;s rise was a direct consequence of Israeli policies. &ldquo;The Israelis occupied 10% of Lebanese soil, southern Lebanon, for 18 years. And the Lebanese wanted them right back out of their country,&rdquo; he explains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The Shiites of southern Lebanon, who nobody ever heard of&hellip; before Israel occupied that area, threw up these resistance movements like Hezbollah. It was Israel that radicalized the Shiites of southern Lebanon,&rdquo; Cole states.</p>

<p>At a time of book bans and the withholding of critically important struggles in our history, our education system has increasingly failed to provide our young with the tools to become engaged citizens in our much celebrated experiment in democracy. This miseducation of the young has been vastly accelerated by the shocking erosion of civic education in the standardized testing that separates winners and losers in the ranking of our meritocracy.</p>
<p>This reality has been made painfully obvious to Lindsey Cormack, a parent of two young children and a professor of political science at the prestigious Stevens Institute of Technology, teaching a generation of young engineering students in the diminished art of civics education. Sadly, Cormack tells host Robert Scheer that many of her students don&rsquo;t understand the basics of our government: &ldquo;They think they're going to do this big adult thing, participate in democracy, but then they're crestfallen and they're a little heartbroken because someone didn't explain the rules to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scheer responds that the failure to educate all students in civics is built into the design of national tests that omit the tools needed for participation in a vibrant democracy, and Cormack agrees: &ldquo;You brought up ACT and SAT scores ... . When we have this obsession&nbsp;with making higher scores for all of our students and higher aggregate scores for our schools, neither one of these tests has a civics component. So in a compressed classroom day, you're going to have things that get squeezed out. And when we were interviewing teachers, we know that the things that get squeezed out are the things that aren't tested. So civics gets to the side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her despair at the failure of our national education system at every level to fulfill the basic condition for an informed public, Professor Cormack turned to providing parents with a comprehensive and yet highly accessible civics primer: &ldquo;How to Raise a Citizen (And Why It's Up to You to Do It).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scheer and Cormack agree that schools often gloss over topics like slavery, women&rsquo;s right to vote, the Vietnam war and Native American genocide, among other topics. Cormack&nbsp;agrees that &ldquo;governments are less accountable when their people do not understand what's happening.&rdquo; She defends her book as encouragement for parents to fill the educational void.</p>
<p>Scheer praises the book as an important effort in civics education but questions it&rsquo;s dependence on those parents who have the time and knowledge to perform this educational task that should be guaranteed to all children by a responsibly functioning public education system: &ldquo;It's admirable that you would write this book and get parents to do the right thing by their children and by their society. But in order for a society to be healthy, its main structures, certainly of education, have to be healthy.</p>
<p>Cormack accepts that better parenting is not the full answer but defends her efforts as the beginning of a needed solution: &ldquo;I think it is an injustice and a disservice to put a child through a K through 12 schooling environment, especially in a public taxpayer funded schooling environment and not let them know with certainty the government that they are graduating into and how they can influence it ... Do parents solve everything? No. But do enough parents ... see that there is a problem ... want schools to get involved ... have the power to lobby for school boards or to be in state legislatures to change this?

                    <p>In the midst of election season, conversations revolving around the levers of power become more frequent, and in the case of a U.S. presidential election, that often includes debates around the so-called &ldquo;deep state&rdquo;.

The official state, according to Magrass, consists of the elected officials people know very well, who are always in the media spotlight and soak in the blame for the issues that arise from their perceived rule. Meanwhile, the deep state operates largely unnoticed, with the official state serving as cover. &nbsp;&ldquo;It gives free reign to corporations, free reign to the very rich, and they can more or less do whatever they want, with the official state carrying almost all the blame for what happens,&rdquo; Magrass says.</p>
<p>The two professors dive into the history of the deep state concept, as Derber describes, &ldquo;when you look carefully at American history, you see a whole evolution of American fascism, which came at the very beginning of the country and went through evolutionary stages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derber and Magrass argue that the deep state has always been embedded in the power dynamics of the U.S., tracing its roots from the Magna Carta&mdash;which they contend was designed to expand the freedoms of the English noble elites. They also invoke the Civil War, which they see as a divorce between &ldquo;northern capitalism, the capitalist Deep State and the southern proto-fascist deep state.&rdquo; Today, each of the U.S. political parties represent a further expansion of this subversive ruling elite and Derber and Magrass argue that only an expanded public awareness of this hidden power structure will bring accountability to those who operate behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Scheer summarizes the importance of understanding how real power works in the U.S.: &ldquo;There's a reason why we don't talk about class and caste in America, because the illusion of this egalitarian society is the main cover up of how the system works.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">The genocide in Gaza has brought the issue of Israel &mdash; and what it represents for Jewish people &mdash; into the forefront of Jewish communities worldwide. The powerful influence of the Israel lobby on Israel&rsquo;s image in the United States makes this issue highly contentious and deeply complex.</p>
<p>In this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast, host Robert Scheer and Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace (FMEP), a nonprofit dedicated to fostering peace between Israel and Palestine, explain &mdash; as two Jewish individuals &mdash; how they navigate these complex issues, both in their professional work and personal lives.</p>
<p>Drawing on her experience working with the U.S. Foreign Service in Jerusalem around the time of the Oslo Accords, Friedman offers a complex view of the politics of the situation. Friedman discusses not only the evolving Jewish relationship to Israel but also the plight of the Palestinians who are often subjected to displacement, violence and death.</p>
<p>Friedman highlights a critical distinction when discussing the Oslo Accords: unlike most treaties, which are based on a balance of interests, the Israel-Palestine agreement is rooted in a balance of power. This dynamic, which heavily favors Israel, was recognized by Friedman: &ldquo;I think that became very clear as the underlying dynamic of Oslo very, very quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it comes to interpreting Israel, Friedman points out the difficulty in engaging with its defenders. &ldquo;The entirety of Israel's existence has been grounded in a series of narratives, and it's almost a pick a long menu for which narrative best suits you at what moment,&rdquo; she tells Scheer.</p>
<p>The narrative turning Hamas&rsquo; recent attack on Israel into a justification of the genocidal attack on Gaza has made it very difficult for anti-Zionist or non-Zionist Jews to express themselves. Friedman conveys her frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm now living in a world where it doesn't matter what your level of faith is, it doesn't matter what your genealogy is, it doesn't matter your self identification. If you're not deeply Zionist in your political outlook, then you're not really a Jew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Friedman highlights a critical distinction when discussing the Oslo Accords: unlike most treaties, which are based on a balance of interests, the Israel-Palestine agreement is rooted in a balance of power. This dynamic, which heavily favors Israel, was recognized by Friedman: &ldquo;I think that became very clear as the underlying dynamic of Oslo very, very quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it comes to interpreting Israel, Friedman points out the difficulty in engaging with its defenders. &ldquo;The entirety of Israel's existence has been grounded in a series of narratives, and it's almost a pick a long menu for which narrative best suits you at what moment,&rdquo; she tells Scheer.</p>
<p>The narrative turning Hamas&rsquo; recent attack on Israel into a justification of the genocidal attack on Gaza has made it very difficult for anti-Zionist or non-Zionist Jews to express themselves. Friedman conveys her frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm now living in a world where it doesn't matter what your level of faith is, it doesn't matter what your genealogy is, it doesn't matter your self identification. If you're not deeply Zionist in your political outlook, then you're not really a Jew.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Israel and its lobby today try to conflate the state with Jews around the world, that it speaks for Jews and encompasses the entire diaspora. Richard Silverstein, author and journalist of the Tikun Olam blog, says that this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. As the genocide in Gaza rages on, along with the killing of Israeli citizens and the mass torture of Palestinians, the support for Israel among Jews, particularly the younger generation, will continue to falter as the state itself plunges deeper into despair.</p>
<p>Silverstein speaks to host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to detail his relationship with Israel and Zionism and how his views have evolved over time, ultimately leading to a complete disconnection from the state, especially in light of the ongoing genocide, and now calling himself an anti-Zionist.</p>
<p>Being raised Jewish and earning degrees from Jewish Theological Seminary and Columbia University, as well as studying Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University in Israel, Silverstein makes clear: &ldquo;[F]or you and for me and for most American Jews, Judaism is not genocide in Gaza, is not $20 billion or $80 billion in arms being sent by the US to Israel to kill Palestinians. That's not the kind of Judaism that I represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only is the genocide a driving force behind the alienation of the Israel state but also the way it treats its own citizens, looking at them as expendable in its objective to kill Hamas operators. Silverstein refers to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726262358195000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3i_8mjcqzMTvLzV97dMUBe">Hannibal Directive</a>, a procedure used by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to prevent the capture of soldiers by killing them and their captors. &ldquo;[Y]ou now have a code that is expanded to also killing your own civilians. And that's, I think, what is even more profoundly upsetting, disturbing about the way in which Hannibal is being used right now,&rdquo; Silverstein tells Scheer.</p>
<p>Torture and rape of Palestinian prisoners is also something that has emerged from Israel&rsquo;s onslaught on Gaza and the West Bank, according to Silverstein. &ldquo;We have Palestinians in Gaza who were swept up in detention raids and brought to concentration camps, really, in Israel, and there they're tortured,&rdquo; he states.</p>
<p>Silverstein insists that what is happening in Gaza does not represent Judaism worldwide like Israel claims, and that &ldquo;American Judaism needs to stand on its own.&rdquo; American Jews, Silverstein says, &ldquo;really have to separate [themselves] from the hostility, the anger, the violence that Israel represents.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The CIA&rsquo;s destructive role in world politics since the end of World War II as a secret rogue spy agency controlled by unelected intelligence officers has become so ubiquitous that it can be joked about. But behind the jokes lies a far darker reality: the agency's imperial ambitions have fueled a legacy of death and destruction in the name of expanding American power. Hugh Wilford, author and professor of history at California State University Long Beach, joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to delve into the specifics of CIA operations and their impact on geopolitics from its inception to the present day.</p>
<p>Wilford&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The CIA: An Imperial History,&rdquo; emphasizes how the CIA is an unprecedented force in the world, advancing the goals of a global empire with a facade of spreading democracy. Although it makes for good Hollywood stories, the subversiveness of the agency alongside its brutal methods made it such an effective power that Scheer describes as capable of &ldquo;destroying the right of people to make their own history.&rdquo; The two mention the coup in Iran in 1953, choreographed by the CIA, and operations in Vietnam in the &lsquo;60s and most odious examples.</p>
<p>The CIA&rsquo;s bloody worldwide campaigns would leave populations dazed and confused, all under the pretense of acting in their best interest, while the rest of the world remained similarly in the dark. Wilford explains, &ldquo;It's not just that America is trying to hide its imperial role from world audiences, from people in the post-colonial world in the Global South, it's also somewhat trying to hide what it's doing from U.S. citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These imperial ambitions, Wilford warns, inevitably have a way of backfiring, and the CIA&rsquo;s history is proof of that. The CIA&rsquo;s consistent meddling in the Middle East in the 20th century resulted, for instance, in the occupation of the Palestinian people, which has translated to the genocide today. &ldquo;The growth of this massive secret state to carry out this globalist foreign policy has had baleful consequences, disastrous consequences, not just for people living overseas, but for people within the United States as well,&rdquo; Wilford explains.</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">The &ldquo;big club&rdquo; that &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t in,&rdquo; as George Carlin famously put it, is increasingly visible as the presidential election rolls on toward November. Politicians and the donor class that controls them have made it known to the public that they are not representatives of the majority but rather the small elite minority. Nomi Prins, financial historian, author and former Goldman Sachs managing director, joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to describe exactly how this process works as well as touch on the evolution of the world economy away from the U.S.</p>
<p>As a result of U.S. mishaps in 2008 with the financial crisis as well as the current geopolitical involvements in Ukraine and growing disruptions between the U.S. and China, Prins explains how the world is recognizing the ability to move past the U.S. as well as the dollar: &ldquo;What's happened is the alliance of nations that needed the U.S. and needed the dollar to trade don't need it anymore.&rdquo; China&rsquo;s rise with the BRICS nations alongside has encouraged this, and the U.S.&rsquo;s policies of supporting the financial system and allowing the banks to run things has led to the rest of the world to say, &ldquo;We will compete, we'll do exactly what you're doing, but we're going to do it on our own terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back at home, when it comes to economic justice, the two party system, in short, is a farce, and the difference between how the internal system of each party works is hardly noticeable. &ldquo;Everything kind of moves upward and gets smaller as it moves upward in terms of who has the power and who wants to retain the power,&rdquo; Prins tells Scheer. That&rsquo;s why, she asserts, &ldquo;even if things get questioned on the surface, the idea of changing them doesn't really get pushed throughout party policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As much as people try to push for or enact change, the questions fall on deaf ears, Prins says.&nbsp;People &ldquo;can blame the other party, they can blame each other, but they don't get to blame the system, because they don't feel that there's any real connection or control that they could have over the system.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">It is around that time in an election year where the typical platitudes and ultimatums exclaiming it is &ldquo;do or die,&rdquo; &ldquo;now or never&rdquo; are being thrown around. The overarching narrative from the past two elections remains the same: the Democrats are not great: they bolster the military industrial complex, make empty promises to working people and maintain sometimes identical policies to their right wing counterparts on issues like immigration &hellip; but we must choose them or face the wrath of Donald Trump and the Republicans.</p>
<p>In this spirited debate on the Scheer Intelligence podcast, host Robert Scheer spars with Jeff Cohen&mdash;author, co-founder of RootsAction.org, founder of FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), and retired journalism professor at Ithaca College. The two butt heads around the issue of lesser evilism, questioning whether this year will bring actual change from the Democrats in their support for Israel&rsquo;s suppression of the Palestineans alongside a range of other pressing issues.</p>
<p>Cohen stresses that while the Biden administration&rsquo;s actions involving Gaza, Ukraine and its saber-rattling of China and Russia are &ldquo;inexcusable,&rdquo; a Trump reelection will prove to be worse on all fronts. &ldquo;Trump's second term will be very, very different than the first. He had no plan, it was chaotic. They [now] have a plan,&rdquo; Cohen tells Scheer. &ldquo;They're going to implement &lsquo;Drill, baby, drill!&rsquo; which threatens the whole planet. And trust me, they have a plan to suppress progressive dissent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scheer fires back, arguing that this is the exact same argument that has been heard not only in recent elections but for most of his long life. &ldquo;What we do is we center most of our political discussion, knowledge in this country around the character of the president and these periodic elections: who are the virtuous, who are the evil?&rdquo; Scheer retorts. &ldquo;Whereas, in fact, we face very profound, systemic problems that the election tends to obscure.&rdquo;</p>

He had no plan, it was chaotic. They [now] have a plan,&rdquo; Cohen tells Scheer. &ldquo;They're going to implement &lsquo;Drill, baby, drill!&rsquo; which threatens the whole planet. And trust me, they have a plan to suppress progressive dissent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scheer fires back, arguing that this is the exact same argument that has been heard not only in recent elections but for most of his long life. &ldquo;What we do is we center most of our political discussion, knowledge in this country around the character of the president and these periodic elections: who are the virtuous, who are the evil?&rdquo; Scheer retorts. &ldquo;Whereas, in fact, we face very profound, systemic problems that the election tends to obscure.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Those seeking systemic change often aim to radically overhaul the existing structure and directly challenge the rot they see within. Although history has shown this to be successful at times, it is usually extinguished by the powers that be and perhaps more pragmatic approaches could have brought about the sought change. This is the story told by Dr. Donna J. Nicol, an author and academic, about Dr. Claudia Hampton and her journey to preserve affirmative action. Nicol joins Scheer Intelligence host Robert Scheer to discuss her new book, &ldquo;Black Woman on Board: Claudia Hampton, the California State University, and the Fight to Save Affirmative Action.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nicol sets the scene for her protagonist, introducing the time period in which Black radicalism is at a particular high following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. According to Nicol, Hampton chooses an approach that relies on the tedious path of making inroads with those in power. &ldquo;[Hampton&rsquo;s] working in the system not as a Black radical, but as someone who chooses a different way of operating, of a different way of leading, which I refer to in the book as &lsquo;sly civility,&rsquo;&rdquo; Nicol tells Scheer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Self-awareness led her down this path, Nicol said. &ldquo;She understands that her race and her gender are things that can be held against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The radicalism is still relevant, however, and Nicol describes how a person like Hampton is able to render that spirit into meaningful legislation. &ldquo;We need that agitation on the outside, but we need somebody on the inside to translate this into policy, to translate this into resources for the community,&rdquo; Nicol said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Without Hampton, affirmative action wouldn&rsquo;t have looked the way it ended up. Nicol tells Scheer about Hampton&rsquo;s time on the California State University board of trustees from 1974 to 1994, including how &ldquo;during her 20 years on the board, you see the highest increase of students of color, of faculty of color, and those numbers have not been replicated since then.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Seventy-nine years ago, the Truman administration dropped atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, instantly killing approximately 100,000 innocent civilians. Host Robert Scheer calls these horrific incidents among the major instances of terror ever committed in human history.</p>
<p>Bill Hartung of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft joins Scheer Intelligence to discuss the history and legacy of nuclear weapons in relation to the military industrial complex, as a $2 trillion effort from the Pentagon to build &ldquo;a new generation of nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and submarines&rdquo; takes place.</p>
<p>The central question underlying the conversation is asked by Scheer; &ldquo;How could they, in good conscience, be talking about modernizing the devil's weapon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hartung claims that the Pentagon and arms manufacturers are doing so under the guise of deterrence, but also because of false stories of controllable nuclear war and even the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; consideration that it may be necessary to use nuclear weapons on certain populations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think some of the folks promoting this stuff would like to believe that they're not putting the future of humanity at risk. So they kind of tell themselves these stories, which they then tell to the public and hope they can persuade them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past, the horror of nuclear war was widely acknowledged to some extent by the public and the political class alike, as even Reagan said a nuclear war could never be won and should never be fought. Hartung claims that the belief that nuclear war could be winnable was previously &ldquo;pushed off the agenda,&rdquo; but it &ldquo;seems to be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite movies like&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>, which to some extent injected the issue of nuclear war into public discussion, citizens and the media remain largely uninterested and unaware of the dangers of nuclear war, especially with regard to the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the opinions of the American political class. Hartung points out that &ldquo;if you go to Washington, there's this sort of atmosphere that, if you're for reducing these things, you know, you're the one who's unrealistic. The logic is flipped on its head ...&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Any threat to the status quo within the American empire has led to the censorship, jailing and escape of the dissidents brave enough to stand against it. One may think of Edward Snowden&rsquo;s asylum in Russia or Julian Assange&rsquo;s refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London as recent examples. However, the history of dissidents fleeing American persecution runs deep. Joining host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to discuss his new book, &ldquo;<a href="https://orbooks.com/catalog/flights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orbooks.com/catalog/flights/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1722638719960000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FunaCXkO3RGg2s-LlsDYD">Flights: Radicals on the Run</a>,&rdquo; is author and journalist Joel Whitney.</p>
<p>The book exemplifies this missing history of dissent in America through accounts of people such as Angela Davis, Paul Robeson, Graham Greene and Malcolm X. Also included are the accounts of Lorraine Hansberry and her mentor, W.E.B. Du Bois. Whitney refers to De Bois&rsquo; time starting an anti-nuclear peace movement and subsequently being persecuted by the U.S. government. &ldquo;[Du Bois&rsquo;] reputation took severe damage, so when Hansberry knew him, he could barely afford to buy groceries,&rdquo; Whitney told Scheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flights&rdquo; examines the stories of historic struggle of progressive thinkers and political activists who faced the onslaught of Cold War propaganda and McCarthyism, becoming refugees as a result of their political work. The book chronicles a counter-narrative of American history, where the bravest and most outspoken figures criticizing the system are crushed by it and their lives ruined.</p>
<p><br>The book title, according to Whitney, refers to &ldquo;flights that are political persecution in some form or another. In a way, you could think of it as 50 or 60 years of counter revolution, massive amounts of funding to chase people &hellip; across borders, out of print and, in some cases, unfortunately, into an early grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the case of people like Graham Greene and his famous novel, &ldquo;The Quiet American,&rdquo; the blacklisting of himself and others for their exposure of American activities during the Vietnam War led to Americans &ldquo;hav[ing] to wait about a decade or a little bit more to actually understand what carnage, what incredible, cynical violence the anti-communist Americans are overseeing in Vietnam as they're taking it over from the French.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Although Julian Assange is free and home in his native Australia, his story and decade-long suffering at the hands of the U.S. government must never be forgotten for the sake of the survival&nbsp;of the First Amendment. In this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast, host Robert Scheer is joined by Kevin Gosztola, who runs&nbsp;<a href="https://thedissenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thedissenter.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721420321413000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DFGW1DGf4dXX0epBJJ3fC">The Dissenter</a>&nbsp;newsletter and has been reporting on the Assange case and whistleblowers in the U.S. for more than a decade. Together, they underscore the significance of the Assange case and delve into the details explored in Gosztola's recent book, "<a href="https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4493-guilty-of-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4493-guilty-of-journalism&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721420321413000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rEFmOmZMTVdr2ctZzSvac">Guilty of Journalism</a>."</p>
<p>Gosztola makes clear one of the main points of the whole ordeal, which is the inconsistency in the U.S.&rsquo;s interpretation of its own laws. &ldquo;The First Amendment and the Espionage Act are in conflict in this country. You can't reconcile the two, at least the way that the Justice Department wants to use the Espionage Act against people who aren't even just U.S. citizens. They're trying to apply U.S. law to international journalists,&rdquo; Gosztola told Scheer.</p>
<p>The U.S. response to the internet age and the powerful journalistic revelations of Assange and WikiLeaks was to criminalize such actions, sending a clear message: anyone attempting to blow the whistle or expose the U.S. government's crimes would face severe punishment, including the use of the Espionage Act, which could imprison someone for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike Daniel Ellsberg, [Chelsea] Manning didn't have to sit there at a Xerox machine making copies. [She] just sent the copies of the documents to WikiLeaks, and then WikiLeaks had all these files that they could share with the world,&rdquo; Gosztola said.</p>
<p>Despite the online journalism revolution, many in the media space still remained quiet throughout the&nbsp; Assange debacle both because of their ties to government officials and their lack of professional rigor. Gosztola posed several questions to them:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Where were you? Why weren't you doing the investigations to uncover these details? Why did this WikiLeaks organization come along and reveal these details about Afghanistan, the Iraq War, the nature of US foreign policy? Why do you accept that all of this information that was classified should be classified?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Unlike Daniel Ellsberg, [Chelsea] Manning didn't have to sit there at a Xerox machine making copies. [She] just sent the copies of the documents to WikiLeaks, and then WikiLeaks had all these files that they could share with the world,&rdquo; Gosztola said.</p>
<p>Despite the online journalism revolution, many in the media space still remained quiet throughout the&nbsp; Assange debacle both because of their ties to government officials and their lack of professional rigor. Gosztola posed several questions to them:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Where were you? Why weren't you doing the investigations to uncover these details? Why did this WikiLeaks organization come along and reveal these details about Afghanistan, the Iraq War, the nature of US foreign policy? Why do you accept that all of this information that was classified should be classified?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The 75th anniversary celebrating the creation of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, creates an opportunity for those in the war machine to double down their commitment to war and for peace advocates to amplify their calls for non-violence.

<p dir="ltr">According to Swanson, NATO's original function as a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union has outlived the fall of the communist state and transformed the organization into a rapidly expanding extension of the U.S. war machine. &ldquo;You don't have to ask informed historians or intelligent peace activists. The Secretary General of NATO says it; they now wage wars, not just in defense or what they call deterrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What was once envisioned as an adjunct to the United Nations addressing war and peace has now evolved, with NATO extending its reach far beyond the Atlantic to forge partnerships with Asian countries in a militarized response to China's rise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Swanson does not make light of what this will mean for the future: &ldquo;It's the end of everything. It's the end of all life on earth. There's no small nuclear war. There's no tactical nuclear war, and yet this is where we're headed.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">The Supreme Court&rsquo;s recent decision to allow cities to ban people from sleeping outdoors presents a major shift in the perception of poverty and homelessness in the U.S. and what the Eighth Amendment represents. Clare Pastore, a law professor at the University of Southern California, joins her faculty colleague Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to break down what the decision means and expand on her&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-rules-cities-can-ban-homeless-people-from-sleeping-outdoors-sotomayor-dissent-summarizes-opinion-as-stay-awake-or-be-arrested-232955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-rules-cities-can-ban-homeless-people-from-sleeping-outdoors-sotomayor-dissent-summarizes-opinion-as-stay-awake-or-be-arrested-232955&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1720133470239000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OgCBeg_d7QHQAniELrDpX">article</a>&nbsp;published in The Conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pastore explains that the legal precedent reversed by the conservative majority was that &ldquo;it's cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to criminalize sleeping outdoors for people who have no other option.&rdquo; Now, Pastore tells Scheer, cities are not barred from enforcing this kind of criminalization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;These are not laws to protect people. Homeless people are at greater danger than they are a danger to others. These are laws trying to get people to just move out of the jurisdiction and go somewhere else,&rdquo; Pastore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scheer argues that the problem has been around long before the recent SCOTUS decision and the elephant in the room for states like California, which Scheer points out is the fifth largest economy in the world, do not use their vast resources to address the problem but rather put the blame on decisions like this and continue their politics that ignore the central issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pastore agrees, telling Scheer, &ldquo;My biggest fear, in terms of a generation of people who are growing up thinking this is normal, is that this idea that this is intractable, is taking hold and it's not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greed in the U.S., where housing is regarded as a private good, strains the ability to attack the roots of the issue. &ldquo;We have very few controls on how much [housing] can cost and we have very few incentives to make it cost less and we just don't put those kinds of legal mechanisms in place to preserve and create more affordable housing,&rdquo; Pastore said.</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Labor has once again emerged as a hot button issue in the United States, so much so that even the likes of Joe Biden and Donald Trump have been spotted lurking around picket lines and union events popping up across the country. To talk about the rise in the American labor movement, Harold Meyerson, editor at large for The American Prospect, joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast. Meyerson has a distinguished career reporting on labor issues for multiple publications, among them the L.A. Times and Washington Post.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meyerson says public support for unions is almost at an all time high and the proof is in the pudding when looking at the various industries organizing in real time across America. From the writer’s strike in Hollywood to the autoworkers in the Midwest to the assistant professors on numerous campuses, people are standing up for their rights as workers and recognizing their strength in numbers. “Gallup and Pew poll on [unions] every year and in the last few years, it's been about 70% approval rating, which is, so far, in excess of the approval rating of virtually any other American institution,” Meyerson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scheer makes sure to remind people of the successes of the labor movement in the past, most notably in one of America’s greatest exports, the entertainment industry, where even Ronald Reagan championed organizing. Along with the autoworkers, Scheer argues the two groups represented the models for unionization and the reason why America had a middle class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The continued recognition of exploitation, greed and misrepresentation at the hands of past administrations, along with corporations reaping the benefits, has culminated in lessons learned from the 2008 financial crisis and previous organizing movements like Occupy. This has resulted in “a greater awareness of the economic inequality between major investors and CEOs on the one hand and regular people on the other hand,” as Meyerson put it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the case of teaching and research assistants on campus, Meyerson has seen an especially huge increase in their enthusiasm for organizing. Mentioning his access to voting data from the National Labor Relations Board, amongst unionized graduate students Meyerson has noted “it was at 89% Yes. That is a statement of generational approval of unions. These are all young people and the polls show that more than 80% of young people are pro-union. And these are workers who can't be fired.”</p>

                    <p>Torture. It stands as one of the pillars of American exceptionalism. While it was a major part of the war on terror—one worth hundreds of millions of dollars—a selective amnesia allows it to slip through the pages of history. John Kiriakou suffered for attempting to solidify the record on a torture program that the U.S. has excused itself from countless times through Hollywood propaganda, innumerable redactions to official documents and silencing of dissidents.<br /><br />Kiriakou joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of the Scheer Intelligence podcast to run back his story as the whistleblower who made one of the most insidious chapters of modern American history widely known. Scheer mentions how the First and Fourth Amendments are treated as indulgences and allowed only if you say the right things in such a setting as the war on terror. If you don’t and “you oppose the torture program, you end up in prison like John Kiriakou. You lose everything, you lose your pension and what have you.”<br /><br />Kiriakou explains that regardless of what treatment was forthcoming, he felt a necessity to expose the horrific crimes his country was committing. He details how a psychologist once explained to him how whistleblowers have a highly defined sense of what is right and wrong and this sense urges them to act. “That's how I felt. I couldn't stop myself. I couldn't sleep at night knowing that this was happening in our name. That the government was carrying out these crimes in our name. So I had to say something,” Kiriakou said.<br /><br />The crimes in question Kiriakou also details: “They threatened to use pages of the Koran as toilet paper. The prisoners, of course, were all Muslim. They made them stand naked in front of female soldiers. Anything they could think of to insult them and to belittle them; they trimmed their beards...”</p>

                    <p>There has been no journalist that has been more effective in penetrating the self-serving secrecy of the NSA and the security state than James Bamford, the Emmy-nominated filmmaker and best-selling author. He joins host Robert Scheer on this episode of Scheer Intelligence to discuss his latest book, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-bamford/spyfail/9781538741153/?lens=twelve" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-bamford/spyfail/9781538741153/?lens%3Dtwelve&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1689461215698000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2po4PEkgrdfJ-Iv1YByqCl" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spyfail: Foreign Spies, Moles, Saboteurs, and the Collapse of America's Counterintelligence</a>. While Bamford has engaged in his share of muckraking on the NSA in his previous works, his new book focuses on an even more pernicious aspect of the intelligence apparatus: their carelessness in allowing foreign governments access to some of our own government’s most treacherous cyberwar creations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the government often likes to claim people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange are the dangerous actors in revealing the inner workings of the U.S. security state, Bamford’s journalism exposes the irony in shifting the blame. Nefarious surveillance and military equipment has been co-opted by foreign governments by way of the NSA yet not much has been done about it. “[T]here's all this effort to silence whistleblowers when there is no effort to really stop foreign countries from accessing the material that NSA has and then… use it against American citizens,” Bamford said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bamford specifically highlights Israel as one of those foreign powers and that might explain the limited mainstream attention given to this latest book. He explores the multi-faceted relationship Israel has to the U.S. with regard to lobbying, Hollywood and espionage. Bamford explained, “Israel has been spying in the United States for a long time and it's been not only not written about, but it hasn't been prosecuted and that's one of the problems.” Names like Arnon Milchan—the Hollywood producer, Israeli spy and Robert De Niro confidant—also came up as an example of someone who has engaged in committing espionage in the U.S. yet has faced no repercussions. Despite his hand in maintaining apartheid in South Africa, being an arms dealer and propagandizing it in the U.S., justice never seems to reach him, Bamford said.</p>

                    <p>Despite the United States accounting for around 5% of the world’s population, it houses nearly a quarter of the world’s prison population. This often discussed metric begins to make sense when examining the major cities like Los Angeles, New York and others, where things like poverty and mental illness are often considered “crimes.” Host Robert Scheer digs into this phenomenon in Los Angeles on this week’s episode of Scheer Intelligence with Melissa Camacho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California.<br /><br />“First of all, it has to do with the criminalization of poverty, the criminalization of mental illness. What are we talking about? These are people who are innocent at this moment and they have not had any day in court,” Scheer expressed. Together, Scheer and Camacho discussed the recent small victories in L.A. county, where subhuman conditions set for detainees have gradually improved, including new limits on how long detainees can be held at inmate reception centers and how long they can be chained to chairs and benches. Camacho explained that the fight for the improvement of these conditions has been ongoing with the ACLU for over 50 years.<br /><br />Before this recent victory, detainees would be subject to environments people often associate with third world countries. “[Detainees] were getting stuck in the [inmate reception center] for days at a time, and those who were the sickest were stuck on the front bench, chained to the front bench for literally 24, 48, 72 [hours]. I talked to somebody who had been on the front bench for 99 hours,” Camacho said.<br /><br />Camacho also mentioned the efforts to control the levels of overpopulation often experienced at these jails. “Our L.A. County jails are authorized to hold around 12,400 people, but they consistently operate above that level, 14,000, 15,000. Before COVID, it was up to 17,000,” Camacho said. As a resident of Los Angeles, Scheer describes how he sees and knows that most of the time, the people who are getting arrested are part of the thousands of houseless people who line the streets of the city.</p>

As a resident of Los Angeles, Scheer describes how he sees and knows that most of the time, the people who are getting arrested are part of the thousands of houseless people who line the streets of the city.</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">The Doomsday Clock continues to tick toward nuclear war, but at its fastest pace ever. Professor Jackson Lears, a former naval officer serving on a U.S cruiser carrying tactical nuclear weapons, considers the current moment more frightening than at any time during the Cold War. Then, there was intense alarm for the fate of the earth and the survival of the human race. Today, rather than diplomacy or negotiation, talk revolves around new weapons shipments, disappointment in Ukraine’s counteroffensive failures, and even drone strikes in Moscow. But far less attention has been paid to the prospect of nuclear war between Russia and the U.S that threatens to end all life on this planet as we know it. That is the alarm sounded by cultural historian and author Jackson Lears who joins host Robert Scheer to discuss Lears’s essay for Harper’s Magazine, “<a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/behind-the-veil-of-indifference-lessons-from-a-nuclear-life/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/behind-the-veil-of-indifference-lessons-from-a-nuclear-life/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1688770252307000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DpD6gNeim2d7ERRcNi2Bk" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behind the Veil of Indifference.</a>”</p>
<p>Lears’s piece warns that despite the public indifference, a “winnable nuclear war” has entered the minds of American strategists and politicians once again, undermining years of work towards nuclear disarmament. Lears tells Scheer that it is similar to the attitudes from the Cold War, yet this time, there is an eerie disinterest from the American side about even talking to someone like Vladimir Putin. “[T]his is, in a sense, a return to the worst kind of confrontations of the early 1960s but there's a big difference because even Kennedy and even Reagan, cold warriors that they were, were eager to create common ground ultimately between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. And that common ground no longer exists between the U.S. and Russia, and there is no interest in diplomacy at all,” Lears said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scheer and Lears also highlight a critical factor in shaping public perception: the Russiagate controversy and the media's role in complying with government demands for secrecy, beginning in the late 1970s, while also promoting narratives that fostered consent for war with Russia. Scheer said, “if you even dare suggest there's some complexity to this issue, or that the other side might have a point of view, or there's something even worth negotiating about, you're now considered unpatriotic.” Lears agreed: “We have former directors of the CIA who have perjured themselves before Congress, now posing as professional wise men and professional truth tellers on MSNBC and CNN.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wrapping up the discussion, Lears gives an insight into his latest book, <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374719944/animalspirits" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374719944/animalspirits&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1688770252307000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qC_OBvIpkxLz8wgMCLI9e" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animal Spirits: The American Pursuit of Vitality from Camp Meeting to Wall Street</a>. In it, Lears explores the history behind thinkers in America who honed in on vitalism rather than the restrictive nature of traditional cultures involving religion, science and commercialization.</p>

                    <p dir="ltr">Peter Singer knows it is difficult to make a lonely stand against the mega corporate food processing machine. To make meaningful changes to diet, to care more about where food comes from and to consider the vast laundry list of problems that comes with the international food industry requires a great deal of attention to detail and resourcefulness. Singer, through his persuasive and forgiving prose, makes it easier for folks to get in the know about what a trip to the supermarket really entails. Singer joins host Robert Scheer for this week’s Scheer Intelligence episode to talk about the renewed version of his classic book, <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/animal-liberation-now-peter-singer?variant=40952213110818" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.harpercollins.com/products/animal-liberation-now-peter-singer?variant%3D40952213110818&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1686330490207000&amp;usg=AOvVaw07b5VIS1Qb_tomDjnjgtlk" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animal Liberation Now</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After nearly 50 years since the original publishing of Animal Liberation, Singer finds that there indeed has been change, although not as much as he would have liked. With a fresh perspective on the research regarding food production's impact on climate change, Singer reintroduces his classic with a modern angle. Scheer and Singer revisit the important points that made the book a hit for all these years. For one, despite improvements in regulations in Europe, the U.S. continues to be one of the worst violators of animal welfare. “There's no federal regulation that says you can't keep a chicken in a cage so small that she can't stretch her wings fully or you can't keep a pig in a crate that she can't even turn around in,” Singer says, adding “that's the influence of the lobbyists… the agri-business that is pouring money into Washington lobbyists and preventing any such legislation at the federal level.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The nightmarish conditions of overcrowded food factories, where 20,000 animals are confined and deprived of natural light, while being force-fed subpar nutrition, depict the current state of affairs. Even if you have no sympathy for the animals, “they're under stress, their immune systems are weakened. It's a perfect recipe for creating new viruses… There will be humans who have to go into the sheds, who will pick up the viruses and spread them back to the community. So there's a serious pandemic risk with factory farming,” Singer adds.</p>
<p>Sympathy for these animals should be the goal, however, as Singer attempts to convey throughout the book. “Animals are other beings who are on this planet. They were not placed on this planet just for our benefit. They are living their own lives. And I don't believe that we—because we have power over them, because of our advanced technology—are justified in giving them miserable lives in order to produce their flesh, milk or eggs more cheaply,” he declares.</p>

                    <p>A major shift in global relations has recently transpired. To some in America, it may look like the second coming of the Evil Empire. To much of the rest of the world, it’s a welcome chance for a renewed multipolar order, where the sovereign desires of nations are respected and new collaborations can be established. The deal brokered between Iran and Saudi Arabia, brought together by China, to restore diplomatic relations, is a clear example of that. The 20-year anniversary of the Iraq War is bringing even more attention to the faltering era of U.S. global hegemony and bullying. To add to that, America’s thirst for war with China spells out its acknowledgement of its waning dominance in the world. The last two decades in the Middle East serve as the quintessential case study of U.S. foreign policy and how it served the interests of America’s biggest corporations and stakeholders.</p>
<p><br />University of Michigan Professor Juan Cole, a leading Middle East expert, joins host Robert Scheer this week on Scheer Intelligence to discuss the diminishing role of the U.S. in the world, the way its wars in the Middle East led to this point, and how China is emerging as a frontrunner in the new multipolar world. “The United States is not the only game in town anymore, and that's not been the case since the end of World War II, when the U.S. was 50% of the world economy. It's just becoming smaller, it has a smaller proportion of world wealth and power,” Cole said.</p>
<p><br />Despite the U.S.’s best efforts to thwart prosperity in Iran, countries like China have been circumventing their dollar dominance and now sit in the driver’s seat. “Most countries have been strong-armed by the United States—South Korea, Japan and the European countries—not to buy Iranian petroleum. China has defied the U.S. in this regard and can do so because it has a big, complex economy,” Cole said.</p>

                    <p><span>Here’s a pop quiz: How long has corporate corruption existed? Answer: As long as corporations as we know them have been in business. Thanks to journalist David Montero’s meticulously sourced survey, <span class="m_-728341195982567013gmail-MsoHyperlink"><i><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/315207/kickback-by-david-montero/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/315207/kickback-by-david-montero/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1545768798524000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZI_THpKB-5wIuiMq3vItIWZ1T0Q" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickback: Exposing the Global Corporate Bribery Network</a></i></span>, the consumer public now has access to a wealth of details about the astonishingly shady antics in which multinationals have been engaging since the retro-imperialist heyday of the British East India Company.</span></p>
<p><span>And this malignant strain of corporatism is only getting worse. As Robert Scheer remarks to Montero in this week’s episode of “Scheer Intelligence,” it amounts to nothing short of a “virulent, corrosive, murderous arrangement that has only accelerated in recent years.” Some potential reasons why this global scourge hasn’t been more aggressively treated include: willful ignorance; greed; the widely supported myth that the phenomenon is ‘just’ about white-collar crime; a false sense that corporate malfeasance ranges outside of various states’ jurisdictions; and powerful companies engaging in a race to the bottom because, well, everyone else is doing it.</span></p>
<p><span>But Montero is ready to serve notice to a host of Fortune 500 companies helpfully name-checked throughout the episode that at least two hard-nosed investigators are onto them. Not only has the extent of the damage done been vastly underestimated and underreported, but so long as it grows in the dark, it’s able to feed into the worst kinds of crises around the world. After taking in Montero’s argument, Scheer sums up the stakes powerfully as he remarks that “white-collar crimes are human rights crimes.”</span></p>
