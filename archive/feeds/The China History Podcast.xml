			<description><![CDATA[<div>In this episode, we look at the life of Anson Burlingame, a well-known name  in California. During Lincoln's term as president, he was appointed Chief Minister to China, arriving in Beijing in the summer of 1862. Already well-known in the US as a fiery abolitionist and a man who believed everyone should be treated fairly and with all due respect, he sympathized with the Chinese government. When he arrived in post-Opium Wars, post-Treaty of Tianjin/Convention of Beijing China, he used his respected position among the diplomatic community of the treaty powers to fight for a fair deal for China. In a controversial move, he was appointed by the Qing government to lead a mission to the US and the great capitals of Europe to advocate on China's behalf.<br /> <br /></div> <div><br /> While in the US, Burlingame championed the signing of a treaty, the first of its kind, that recognized China as an equal sovereign nation. It opened the door to legal Chinese immigration and travel to the US. That ended up becoming the treaty's undoing.</div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a nice little standalone episode on the life and work of Thomas Wade and Herbert Giles. And you can't mention Herbert Giles without mentioning his son, Lionel Giles. And of course, Robert Morrison must be mentioned as well as all the earliest Western scholars of Sinology going back to Michele Ruggieri. And it wouldn't be fair to only talk about Wade and the two Giles's without giving a nod to their contemporaries elsewhere on the continent and in Asia. So this is a slightly meandering survey of some of the great old sinologists from the 19th century (and early 20th).  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is only a 2-parter, so this exciting episode will bring the curtain down on Lin Biao and his famous "Incident." We resume the story following the 1970 Lushan Plenum. Lin, or Lin's ambitious manipulators, pushed Chairman Mao just a bit too much at this meeting, and he decided to take immediate action. This whole 913 Incident, as you will hear, was a huge embarrassment to the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it's not surprising that they circled the wagons and went beyond the call of duty to cover up what could still be covered up. Mao had to be careful. With a history filled with men like Wang Mang, Zhu Wen, Zhao Kuangyin, and Yuan Shikai, he knew he had to watch these generals. So here's all the various fun bits of speculation surrounding the days of September 12-13, 1971. No Beatles references in this episode, though I was tempted to mention that Stella McCartney was born on the exact day of the plane crash that ended Lin Biao's life. Thanks everyone, for listening. This episode was posted to Patreon and CHP Premium back in February. Consider joining. You'd have my everlasting appreciation.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is Part 1 of a 2-Part series looking at the life of Lin Biao and the actual Lin Biao Incident itself. This bit of history is documented to death. I downloaded a dozen scholarly papers, read a few books, went through my entire library, and gathered as much information as possible. But practically every source ends with "cannot be proved." The Lin Biao Incident is China's version of the Kennedy assassination. So much we know. So much we have no idea. In this Part 1 episode, I cover Lin Biao's early life and how he rose up on Mao's coattails, going back to the Jiangxi Soviet era. I'll take this episode up to the Lushan Plenum of 1970. That was the beginning of the end of Lin Biao. Be looking for Part 2 in a bit. Thanks, everyone.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Just in time for Liberation Day, I'm presenting this timely episode. Back in 1890, with the aim of protecting American companies from foreign competition, tariffs were jacked up significantly.  With all the advances in transport, logistics, and new technologies, world trade was shifting into a higher gear. For a few centuries, the Ming and Qing emperors did their damnedest to regulate the invasion of European traders clamoring to do business with Chinese merchants. The foreigners wanted free, open, and unfettered trade with China. By the 1890’s and a few humiliating unequal treaties later, the dream finally came true. That’s when the real problems started. Thanks to Dan Stein for this topic idea we discussed over lunch recently.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was afraid I'd barely be able to scrape together enough material for a short episode. Instead, this one is gonna take almost two hours to tell. I hope no one minds that I opted not to drown anyone with Latin names and to go easy on the scientific aspects behind plants. The focus will be on the European and later, American plant hunters who came to China between the 16th and 20th centuries. This episode will look at some of the exploits of the early Jesuit missionaries up through Robert Fortune's four trips to China. Next time in Part 2, all the famous post-Fortune plant hunters will be featured.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I welcomed Wuhan-based Andrew Shaw onto the CHP to talk about his book. It's all about the plundering of China's cultural treasures and imperial artifacts by not just the British, French, and Americans. It seems everyone got in on the act. Even the local people. It's a miracle there was anything left for Chian's museums. Many of you are familiar with the stories about looting that took place in China between the 1840s and the turn of the century. In Andrew Shaw's book, "Spoil" we'll look at the extent of what happened. And on the next episode, we'll feature Andrew again, this time talking about his new book on the history of jade. That's coming February 16th. Of course, Patreon and CHP Premium subscribers will get to hear it a couple weeks earlier. Here's the link if you're interested. <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/c/TheChinaHistoryPodcast%20">https://www.patreon.com/c/TheChinaHistoryPodcast</a></p> <p><strong>Amazon Link to "Spoil" by Mr. Andrew Shaw:</strong> <a href= "https://a.co/d/12c6kPF"><strong>https://a.co/d/12c6kPF</strong></a></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Not too long ago, I had the pleasure of interviewing Mr. Joel Bigman, author of a new book called "The Second Journey." If you're familiar with the Ming Dynasty novel "Journey to the West," this one by Joel might sound familiar. You might never look at "Journey to the West" the same way again. This was quite an interesting and unique story that combined two ancient cultures. It's been called “The World’s first Chinese-Jewish Historical Fantasy.” Nuff said.

I hope you learned a few things about Singapore.</p> <p>Here it is, the final installment of the series. I worked on this particular episode during my Oct-Nov China-HK-Cambodia trip.

Everything from the 1970s to the present day is also squeezed into Part 10. Many of you might remember some of these blasts from the past.</p> <p>I'll also look at Singapore-PRC relations and how things developed in recent decades. This final episode will be released on January 19, 2025. I recorded it at Digby Wren's studio in early November and it's been available on my Patreon and CHP Premium channels since then. And now finally, here it is. A special thanks to all Singaporeans and expats there who wrote to me over the past few months with your kind words.</p> <p><strong>Special thanks to Dr. Digby James Wren for allowing me the use of his Phnom Penh Studio!</strong></p> <p><strong>Find him at:</strong></p> <p><a href= "https://substack.com/@thechairlive">https://substack.com/@thechairlive</a></p> <p><a href= "https://longmekong.substack.com/">https://longmekong.substack.com/</a></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In its hour of need, quite a few leaders rose to the occasion in Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew didn't transform the nation by himself. Last time we saw how S. Rajaratnam carried the flag around the world and advanced Singapore diplomatically. In this episode, I'll also introduce Dutch economist Dr. Albert Winsemius and his good advice. Winsemius suggested a number of priorities for Singapore to gain some economic traction. The man who had to make these ideas happen in real life was Dr. Goh Keng Swee. We'll look at Dr. Goh's life and contribution to Singapore's first decades as a country. He served in several ministries of the government and made profound changes wherever he served. We'll close out the episode with the retirement of the first generation of Singapore leaders. We'll conclude the series next time in Part 10 where we'll take things up to our day.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We left off last time with Singapore being granted sovereignty by Britain on June 3, 1959, and Tunku Abdul Rahman’s “Grand Design” speech concerning a merger between Malaysia and Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew took this pro-merger message directly to the people of Singapore. We’ll see how Lee deals with the political left by launching Operation Coldstore on February 2, 1963. Once the merger was completed, Singapore and Malaysia gave it their best shot to make it work. Happening concurrently with this sensitive time in Singapore’s history, Indonesia’s President Sukarno, in May of 1964 spoke out against the merger and began the period known as Konfrontasi or confrontation. We’ll see how things weren’t fated to succeed as the two leaders envisioned. Both The Tunku and the PAP, despite promises not to get mixed up in each others’ politics, fielded their own candidates in each other’s election. The heat started to rise and tempers flared, leading to riots in July and September 1964. We’ll also see how the March 1965 bombing of MacDonald House also created a frightening atmosphere in Singapore. We close with the debate over privileges enjoyed by indigenous Malays in Article 153 of the Constitution and how it conflicted with Lee Kuan Yew’s concept of a Malaysian Malaysia. We’ll finish things off with the exit of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia and its independence on August 9, 1965.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Post-WWII Singapore was a time that was loaded with historical events that shaped how matters would unfold throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. The matter of how to handle the future of Malaya and Singapore begins to be seriously discussed and hotly debated. To showcase what the British and political leaders in Malaya and Singapore were up against, we'll first review the events of the 1950 Maria Hertogh case and the disturbances that followed. In this episode we'll begin to explore the early life of the most consequential leader in Singapore's history and in the greater Southeast Asian scene, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. His early life, including his marriage to Mrs. Kwa Geok Choo, will be introduced. In the early 1950s, Mr. and Mrs. Lee returned from the UK and began their law careers. This led directly to Lee Kuan Yew's involvement in local Singaporean politics and the later founding, in 1954, of the PAP (People's Action Party). The elections of 1948, 1955, and 1959 will also be presented and how the results shaped the future of Singapore politics. Events will unfold that will contribute to Lee Kuan Yew's rise as the leading voice in Singapore's politics and independence. Other major figures from this time will also be introduced such as David Marshall, Lim Yew Hock, Lim Chin Siong, Fong, Swee Suan, and Ong Eng Guan. We'll close with Tunku Abdul Rahman's May 1961 "Grand Design" speech and how this became a game changer as far as how to handle the potential merger of Malaya and Singapore. This will all be introduced next time in Part 8.</p> <p>Thanks to all of you who have kindly supported me by signing up for my Patreon. All ten episodes are already available there.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we see how Japan marched and bicycled their way across the Johor Strait and proceeded to quickly defeat the British Commonwealth troops. Then we see how Japan carried out a brutal and repressive occupation. Massacres at Alexandra Hospital and against the local Chinese residents of Singapore (Sook Ching Massacre) will also be introduced. After Japan's defeat, the British will attempt to resume business as usual. We'll see how the independence movement in Malaya had other plans and why the Malayan Union failed. In Singapore too, the politicians and the people had other aspirations than what the British had in mind. A new leader will emerge in Singapore who we we'll look at in the next few episodes. His name was Lee Kuan Yew.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Although all kinds of tension brewed beneath the surface, the mid to late 19th Century saw a continued bonanza for Singapore. A prosperous combination of hard-working men and women, fearless entrepreneurs, and fortunes made in tin, rubber, and oil refining turned Singapore into the best thing to happen for the British Empire since Trafalgar, or maybe even the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

With a spike in labor demand and with slavery recently abolished, the East India Company comes up with a novel solution. Up in Johor, Daing Ibrahim takes over as the new Temenggong and becomes a ruler that the East India Company can work with.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With Singapore formally established, we look at those first months and years. As soon as the document was signed, Raffles left the island and William Farquhar took over as First Resident. It would be hard to find a more capable person to manage what needed to get the new enterprise up and running. Taking advantage of his personal connections in Melaka and the political and technological dynamic of the time, Farquhar got the ball rolling in Singapore. The Dutch were outraged and plenty of fancy footwork and smooth talking needed to be done to avert a war. Singapore became an overnight sensation in the region. Many traders were attracted to Duty-Free trade. This was one reason the British East India Company wasn't willing to give in to the Dutch so fast. William Farquhar kept it all together and rose to the occasion at this most early period of Singapore's second incarnation. We'll look at the eyebrow-raising measures he took to turn on the government revenue taps and how this will all lead to his undoing. We also look at Farquhar's successor as First Resident, John Crawfurd. How he outfoxed The Temenggong Abdul Rahman and the Sultan Hussein Shah is also presented. We close with immigrants coming to Singapore in droves, soon outnumbering the local Malay populace. After peace with the Dutch was achieved in 1824, it was full speed ahead for Singapore. Four local entrepreneurs who also served as early community leaders are also introduced. These are Tan Tock Seng 陈笃生， Seah Eu Chin 佘有进, Naraina Pillai, and Syed Omar Al-Juneid.</p> <p>You can support my work by subscribing to my Patreon at: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TheChinaHistoryPodcast">https://www.patreon.com/TheChinaHistoryPodcast</a></p> <p>Thank you for listening.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With the arrival of the Portuguese and their 1511 victory, the history of this region began to move in s new direction. The Portuguese and the Dutch rather ignored Singapore and focused their trade and colonizing efforts on the Melaka Coast and in Indonesia. The Johor Sultanate begins its early rise to prominence. The conflict between Britain and the Netherlands ends up having a major effect on the Malay Peninsula and led to the founding of Singapore in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles. We'll take a brief look at his bio and how he ended up having such a profound impact on the earliest years of Singapore's colonial history. The life of William Farquhar is also introduced and the brewing conflict he would have with Raffles. The story of how these two men, along with Lord Hastings, worked out an agreement with the two key figures of the time, Sultan Hussein Shah and the Temenggong Abdul Rahman will be introduced at the end of the episode.</p> <p>This episode has been available on Patreon since July.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Requests to present the history of Singapore go back to 2010 or 2011. At long last, here's an easy-to-consume and digest overview of The Lion City. In Part 1 we'll look at the watered world of Southeast Asia and the Monsoon Winds that led to the earliest intra-Asian sea trade. And of course, the legendary 14th century founding of Singapore will be told. Sri Vijaya, Sang Nila Utama, Temasek, and the five kings of Singapura. The visit of Yuan Dynasty explorer Wang Dayuan will also be introduced as well as his early observations. We'll get as far as the fall of Singapura and the founding of the Sultanates of Melaka and later Johor. When the early 16th century dawns, the arrival of the Portuguese will put the trajectory of Singapore and Malaysian history in a new direction. We'll pick up next time and see how the arrival of the Dutch and British East India Companies start shaking things up in Southeast Asia. Although a lot of what's covered in Part 1 is only legend, one can easily see the history of this small island at the tip of the Malaysian Peninsula goes back far beyond the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles.</p> <p>Patreon supporters are already on Part 6 of this series, not scheduled for release until November 24. Subscribe to my Patreon and earn my ever-lasting gratitude.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>First off, let me apologize for the less-than-optimal audio quality. This is a very informative interview. And for those of you who missed my very old episode from 2013 or thereabouts covering this topic, this discussion will be a real eye-opener. The history of the Chinese immigrant experience in Mexico (and Latin America) is not that well known. Hugo's ancestors emigrated to Mexico from Guangdong back in the 19th century. One of them, Wong Fook Chun was a major figure in the history of those times and he had an interesting interaction with the Qing-era reformer Kang Youwei. I hope you'll suffer through the lousy audio and that you'll get a lot out of this episode. Chinese-Mexican history was once filled with tragedy and violence. Again, sorry about the audio quality. Here's a link to his book, <strong>"America's Lost Chinese: The Rise and Fall of a Migrant Family Dream"</strong>: <a href= "https://a.co/d/0Yh5LiZ">https://a.co/d/0Yh5LiZ</a></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is surprisingly not very well-known and certainly wasn't taught in my US history classes. Here's a story for you that many might find hard to believe. Perhaps you're already familiar with the history of America's Chinese Paper Sons. Less known is the story of the 1957 Chinese Confessions Program. In this episode, we'll look back on the early to mid-20th century. First I'll present a general overview of San Francisco's Paper Sons and some of the history and culture that surrounded it. Then we can take another romp through Red Scare America in the 1950s and the 1957 Chinese Confessions Program. This one, I'm sure most of you never read about.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices. Visit <a href= "https://megaphone.fm/adchoices">megaphone.fm/adchoices</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I'm presenting a simple but still informative overview of not only the Grand Canal but also the bigger subject of canals in China. The history of the Grand Canal isn't one clean linear story of a structure built all at one time. Although it measures over a thousand miles long, much of that distance was pre-existing in the form of rivers and old canals that were joined together to form an uninterrupted passage. A lot of the academic papers I used to research this topic, despite water being the main topic, were as dry as the day is long. I tried to make it all nice and simple and easy to digest. This World Heritage Site is well-known to many but its history, perhaps less so.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

On his most recent trip to Yunnan to work on his upcoming book on the 1875 Margary Affair, David had a chance encounter with a taxi driver who was a sixth-generation descendent of Jiang Zonghan, someone closely related to the little-known but rather consequential event that took place in February 1875 along the Yunnan-Myanmar border.

Here's a link to the article. <a href= "https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3272812/who-built-first-bridge-over-yangtze-river-unlikely-tale-chinese-slave-soldier-and-tycoon-jiang"> https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3272812/who-built-first-bridge-over-yangtze-river-unlikely-tale-chinese-slave-soldier-and-tycoon-jiang</a></p> <p>Website: <a href= "https://www.davidleffman.com/">https://www.davidleffman.com/</a></p> <p></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the third time the history and traditions behind a Chinese holiday is being introduced. The history behind the Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival were both presented back in the days when I knew even less than I do now about how to podcast. The Hungry Ghost Festival goes by a number of names, mainly because it's one of those rare festivals that is celebrated by both Daoists and Buddhists. It's called the Zhōngyuán 中元， Qīyuèbàn 七月半, Yúlánpén 盂兰盆, and Ullambana Festival. Daoists and Buddhists have their own spin on the legends behind the Hungry Ghost Festival. But the main idea remains the same. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the gates of hell open up for all Hungry Ghosts to return to the world of the living and for the living to show them the respect and kindness they were denied in their living forms.</p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/lahungryghostfest/">https://www.instagram.com/lahungryghostfest/</a></p> <p><a href= "https://chssc.org/event/la-chinatown-hungry-ghost-festival/">https://chssc.org/event/la-chinatown-hungry-ghost-festival/</a></p> <p><a href= "https://lahungryghostfestival.com/">https://lahungryghostfestival.com/</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.micahhuangmusic.com/">https://www.micahhuangmusic.com/</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/hungryghostnote/">https://www.instagram.com/hungryghostnote/</a></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Firstly, hats off to Emma and her 团队 at the CYZ for all their hard work, all season-long. We close out the season 9 with an amusing story from a source, as yet never featured on this long-running educational program, called the Guòtínglù 过庭录. The author was Song literary figure Fàn Gōngchēng 范公偁 who had the misfortune to be born during the exact time when the Northern Song ended and the Southern Song began. In this tale, our young hero Sūn Shān 孙山 heads off to the capital to take the imperial exam. Another villager tagged along who also registered to take the test. One passed the test and the other was Míng Luò Sūn Shān 名落孙山. It's a nice little story infused with some of the best of Chinese culture and a dollop of human decency. That's it for Season 9. I may post a few director's cuts of previous CSP episodes during the off-season. All these CSP episodes will soon be published in the Summer catalog of Earnshaw Books. There will be vocabulary lists, tone marks, and characters. Just sayin. Thanks, everyone and drink plenty of water this summer. Keep yourself hydrated!</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For our eighth CSP offering this season, we open up the Book of Han once again and hear the story behind Jiāo Bīng Bì Bài 骄兵必败. It doesn't always happen this way but the timeline of history is filled with examples of more powerful military forces being defeated on the field of battle by their weaker opponent. Arrogant soldiers must be defeated. Look what happened in Vietnam between 1954 and 1975. When you look into it, even today in our own time, Jiāo bīng bì bài is still happening. On a geopolitical level, this must be one of the hardest lessons to learn. More pugnacious world leaders should consult the Book of Han and ponder these words.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We've already heard about Confucianism, The Hundred Schools, and the Yi Jing. In this episode, we look at Daoism. The life of Lao Tzu (Laozi) will be introduced along with the book he probably never wrote but which is ascribed to him anyway. This is the Tao Te Ching or Dao De Jing. Laozi was quite a character and by telling his story, it will give you the fundamentals to explore on your own what this philosophic thought is all about. We'll look at the Daoist concept of Wu Wei 无为 and the art of quiescence. We'll close with one of the earliest and greatest interpreters of the Daodejing, Wang Bi.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've already heard about Confucianism, The Hundred Schools, and the Yi Jing. In this episode, we look at Daoism. The life of Lao Tzu (Laozi) will be introduced along with the book he probably never wrote but which is ascribed to him anyway. This is the Tao Te Ching or Dao De Jing. Laozi was quite a character and by telling his story, it will give you the fundamentals to explore on your own what this philosophic thought is all about. We'll look at the Daoist concept of Wu Wei 无为 and the art of quiescence. We'll close with one of the earliest and greatest interpreters of the Daodejing, Wang Bi. In the History of Chinese Philosophy Part 13, we'll start looking at Zhuangzi and his classic book.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

The story behind this Chinese Saying stars none other than (one of China's greatest poets) Li Bai. As a youngster, Li Bai chanced upon an old woman, surnamed Wu, who was intent on accomplishing a seemingly impossible (in Li Bai's eyes) task. Don't let any naysayers deter you.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Once again, as a regular feature to the CHP, I'm including the latest Chinese Sayings Podcast offering. This one may be a bit of a departure from the average CSP episode. The Chinese Saying for this time is Jiǎn Bú Duàn, Lǐ Hái Luàn-剪不断 理还乱. Many Chinese poetry lovers and aficionados may already be familiar with this line from the 10th-century poem 相见欢. Today's CSP offering is more of a history lesson than an introduction to a chengyu but it's worth it to hear it out to the end. The star of this episode is the final ruler of the Southern Tang Dynasty. Like his kindred spirit emperor Huizong of the Northern Song, Li Yu 李煜 of Southern Tang wasn't much of a ruler. But what he lacked in leadership ability he made up for it with his great literary skills, especially where cí 词 poetry was concerned.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Like James Dean, Confucius was much bigger in death than he was in his own lifetime. It wasn't until the Han Dynasty that Confucianism enjoyed a major triumph. This time we'll look at Dong Zhongshu who was so consequential in tying Confucianism and the imperial government into one system. We'll also look at Sima Tan (father of Sima Qian) and the Six Schools, as well as the first explainers of Confucianism: Liu Xin, Wang Chong, and Yang Xiong. I hope you're enjoying this series.

The occasion was the official release date of her new book, "The Earthly Blaze" (links below). We first discussed the life and work of Zha Liangyong, also known as Louis Cha.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week's Chinese Saying is another good and respectable one that comes to us compliments of the Book of Song. It concerns the Northern Song official and literatus Yang Shi. His two main teachers were the famous Cheng Brothers, Cheng Hao 程颢 and Cheng Yi 程颐. Those two were giants in Neo-Confucian philosophy which flourished during the Song. This episode features Chéng Mén Lì Xuě 程门立雪. It's a story of respect and reverence for those teachers who had a profound effect on the direction of our lives. "Standing in the snow in front of the Cheng's gate." This is another in a very long line of stories that would feel right at home in the "Made Me Smile" subreddit. For anyone who has one or more teachers who made a positive difference in their life, this is a good 成语 to describe your feelings.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

This is another in a very long line of stories that would feel right at home in the "Made Me Smile" subreddit. For anyone who has one or more teachers who made a positive difference in their life, this is a good 成语 to describe your feelings.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2017, I produced a nine-part series on the history of Chinese philosophy. These were once episodes CHP-184 to 192. In 2021, I removed this series from the CHP lineup of shows and published it as an online course. Since last year the History of Chinese Philosophy series has only been available on my Patreon and CHP Premium. What you're listening to here is an updated and new recording from what first came out seven years ago.</p> <p>In the first of 18 episodes that will be covered in this series, we look at Chinese Philosophy’s Ancient Beginnings and early Western understanding of Chinese Philosophy. The lives of the ancient Chinese sage kings will also be explored and why some philosophers held them up as role models for society. We will also look at Karl Jaspers's Theory of the Axial Age. For these first ten episodes, the focus will be on pre-Confucian and Confucian philosophers, Legalism, and how Confucianism developed up to the Tang Dynasty.</p> <p>Transcripts to all eighteen episodes are available on Amazon, Barnes Noble, and at Earnshaw Books.

Usually, I release new shows on Sundays at 5 AM L.A. Time. Since I'll be launching the first episode of Season 9 of the Chinese Sayings Podcast this Sunday, I figured I'd release this one Thursday, fresh on the heels of the interview. This is a quick and easy episode that traces the beginnings of timekeeping in China and will survey a few of the most notable horologists from Chinese history from the Han to the Qing Dynasties. The achievements of Zhang Heng, Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Zhan Xiyuan will be examined. Then we'll finish off with the arrival of the Jesuits and the zimingzhong 自鸣钟 clocks they brought with them. Thanks a bunch for listening.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I wouldn't technically call this a Bonus Episode. We're in between seasons right now. And while Laszlo and Emma are busy brainstorming the chengyu lineup for Season 9, here's a re-recording of one of Laszlo's all-time favorite episodes from the seven-year history of the CSP. How can anyone forget Mr. Nanguo, 南郭先生, who posed as a musician for three years without knowing how to play his instrument? He was a Làn Yú Chōng Shù 滥竽充数. He got the gig because the band only needed one more musician. And it didn't matter who it was. Mr. Nanguo was indiscriminately chosen just to make up the required number. A great story and it comes from the Han Feizi. Season 9 should start, hopefully, by the time the Year of the Dragon rolls around on 2/10/2024. Thanks, everyone. I hope you enjoy this Chinese Saying as much as I do.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices. Visit <a href= "https://megaphone.fm/adchoices">megaphone.fm/adchoices</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the 2024 Year-End Closing episode, we continue on with the History of Chinese Medicine during the Sòng. Bi Sheng started a revolution in book printing with his invention of movable type printing. This led to an explosion of new printed titles and wider access to medical texts among the general (urban) populace. During the Song, it became downright respectable to enter the medical profession. Many young people aspiring for a career in officialdom, looked to a career in medicine as either an alternative to working in the government or something to do in addition to serving the emperor. Many advances were made in forensic medicine, pediatrics, and healthy nutrition. And with all the new knowledge and acquisition of new knowledge through interaction with physicians from other cultures, the understanding of human health and how the body operates kept inching forward. In the field of pharmacology, there were also many advances, particularly in the publication of new materia medica texts.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

There are a lot of people in history who all throughout their early years and even into their prime, didn't make much of their life. But come their 50's or 60's they achieve greatness. This time we look at Dà Qì Wǎn Chéng 大器晚成 and the story of Cui Yan and his no-good young relative Cui Lin.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>So much rancor in this world these days. Here's one that describes the feeling of mutual enmity that existed between two giants of their day, Cao Cao and Sun Quan. During the waning years of the Eastern Han Dynasty, three powerful forces jockeyed for position to see who might push the Liu's off the throne and take over to found a new dynasty. There was no reconciliation in the tea leaves. As far as Cao Cao of Wei and Sun Quan of Wu were concerned, that throne was only big enough for one of them. Here's a story from 208 AD that features a useful Chinese Saying born on the eve of the epic Battle of Red Cliffs.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Once again, for all CHP listeners, I'm featuring the latest episode of the Chinese Sayings Podcast. It's said that we human beings have been called social animals by nature. Some of us love other kinds of people more than others do. But no matter how enamored one might be about another culture, nation, or people, we all tend to stick with our own kind. This 4th Century BC Chinese Saying comes from "The Strategies of the Warring States." and concerns the witty and capable minister to King Wei of Qi and his son King Xuan: Chunyu Kun. King Xuan needed to round up several talented souls to help him manage the Kingdom of Qi, where the stunning and beautiful Shandong Peninsula is located. Answering the king's call, Chunyu Kun gathered a whole bunch of worthy and talented men and schooled the king about how easy it was to find them. This is the story behind Wù Yǐ Lèi Jù 物以类聚. I also mentioned another chengyu that goes along with this episode: yīmíng jīngrén 一鸣惊人. You get that one too, at no extra cost, I might add. Only two more episodes to go for this season. Like last time in Season 7, be looking for un episodio extra especial featuring our hardworking and brilliant 领导 of the 成语研究中心 in Beijing: Emma. Looking forward to seeing some of you in Hong Kong during my few days there. My deepest gratitude for listening.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Written into the ancient histories were the big-name Warring States characters Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Sun Bin, and Pang Juan. Sima Qian and others remarked that these four men were all students of Guiguzi 鬼谷子. He's like a lot of figures from Bronze Age China. Guiguzi's name is mentioned in a few important texts. But that's about it. Just his name and the barest of details. Over the centuries, scholars put some flesh on those bones, but the truth remains, there's not much to sink our teeth into as far as Guiguzi the person is concerned. But the stories associated with Guiguzi are good ones and worth a re-telling. Su Qin and Zhang Yi's Vertical and Horizontal Strategies, and the story of Sun Bin, Pang Juan and Sun Bin's Art of War. The Guiguzi is considered China's first work of rhetoric. It's interesting to see how rhetoric developed in Warring States China at the exact same time as Plato and Aristotle in Greece. Somewhere along the way though, The Guiguzi became better known as a military treatise.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Once again, by popular demand, here's another oft-requested topic. With the recent release of the Oppenheimer film, I thought this story was quite timely. Qian Xuesen is called "The Father of China's Missile and Space Program." What's not as well known is the key role he played in the late 1930s and 40s in the United States rocket and jet propulsion programs. He was there, along with Frank Malina, Weld Arnold, Apollo M.O.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, by popular demand, here's another oft-requested topic. With the recent release of the Oppenheimer film, I thought this story was quite timely. Qian Xuesen is called "The Father of China's Missile and Space Program." What's not as well known is the key role he played in the late 1930s and 40s in the United States rocket and jet propulsion programs. He was there, along with Frank Malina, Weld Arnold, Apollo M.O. Smith, Jack Parsons, and Edward S. Forman, when the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was created. Under the leadership of Theodore von Karman, this team led the effort that launched America's missile and rocket programs. But come 1950 Qian's world will be upended. That's all for Part 2.</p> <p>Iris Chang: Thread of the Silkworm: <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Thread-Silkworm-Iris-Chang/dp/0465006787">https://www.amazon.com/Thread-Silkworm-Iris-Chang/dp/0465006787</a></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Once again we thank The Grand Historian for giving up another good one. This one's an eight-character chengyu. The story goes back to 206 BC and the famous story of Liu Bang and Xiang Yu's meeting at The Banquet at Hongmen. Here, the two contenders for the emperorship of China, meet face to face. Only one of them could sit on that throne and beginning right here, the Chu-Han Contention begins. The chengyu for this time, 项庄舞剑, 意在沛公 Xiàng Zhuāng Wǔ Jiàn, Yì Zài Pèi Gōng comes from this slice of history mentioned in the Record of the Grand Historian from the chapter on Xiang Yu. People who have a lot to lose, especially in the world of politics and government should pay attention to this one. It's a good one to use when describing someone who may appear all nice and pleasant but who has a hidden motive to do you harm.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's the final episode in the Yunnan history series. In this episode, we pick up in 1875 in the wake of the Margary Affair and take the story through the end of the Qing and into the Warlord and Republican era. Warlords Cai E, Tang Jiyao, Long Yun, and Lu Han, all make appearances. Part 5 runs almost 49 minutes which is 15-20 minutes longer than I like these CHP episodes to be. The series concludes a bit prematurely, a hundred years later in 1975. Sorry to end on such a downer as the Cultural Revolution and the Shadian Incident of 1975. I really don't have enough material to make a Part 6. So let's just leave it at that. I hope it was informative and helpful.</p> <p><strong>For the pure enjoyment of Pu-Erh Tea Laszlo recommends The Bana Tea Company:</strong> <a href= "https://www.banateacompany.com/"><strong>https://www.banateacompany.com/</strong></a></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

My buddy at 1UP Media, Yeo Guang Jin is running a multi-part series that looks at the humble rise of Alibaba and how Jack Ma built this into one of the great success stories in global corporate history. I'm sharing Part 3 of the series here on the CHP feed which tells the story of how Jack Ma took on mighty eBay and emerged from the competition with Taobao and TMall. Empires features compelling deep dives into some of the most renowned companies in all of Asia: Ten Cent, Sony, and Samsung to name a few.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, Laszlo sat down with good friend Hao Huang and son, Micah, at Scripps College where Hao is the Bessie and Cecil Frankel Chair in Music. In 2021 they co-produced the Blood on Gold Mountain Podcast. In a pilot episode of a new show dropping Wednesday, July 19 called <strong>Iron Horse Road</strong>, Hao and Micah explain what the show is about and the trip they took to California's High Sierras that inspired it. They visited locations where more than a century and a half ago railroad workers from Southern Guangdong built these wonders of engineering. This led to a general discussion about these workers and the challenges they faced living far from home and in a land where every day presented a new set of challenges, often life-threatening. The <strong>Iron Horse Road Podcast</strong> will come out on the Blood on Gold Mountain feed.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this latest installment of the Yunnan History series, we take the narrative up to the Qing Dynasty in the 1800s. The province had been relatively peaceful since the late 13th-century Mongol conquest. Then, not so much come the accession of the Yongzheng Emperor. This episode takes a very quick look at Yunnan literary figure Yang Shen followed by a retelling of the story of Wu Sangui and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. Then, the scourge of the local tribal chieftains of Yunnan, Ortai (È’ěrtài 鄂尔泰) is introduced. And in preparation for Part 4 which will focus on the Panthay Rebellion, I'll also explain some background info on the Hui People of Yunnan, beginning with Sayyid Ajall Shams al-Din Omar al-Bukhari.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, I've had the great pleasure of working with a talented group of game developers at Paradox Tinto, one of the studios where they design and develop history-based grand strategy games. These Grand Strategy Games are enjoyed all over the world. One member of the team at Paradox Tinto who I had the pleasure to work with, was Barcelona-based Álvaro Sanz. Together we worked on a selection of history-based lectures that accompany the Europa Universalis IV Mandate of Heaven DLC (DLC: Downloadable Content). The time period covered in the game coincides with the Ming and early Qing Dynasties. This series of lectures accompanied the time period of the Mandate of Heaven DLC. And as of June 20th, everything's now available to all players of Europa Universalis IV. This experience of collaborating with the team at Paradox to develop all this new content was also a great learning experience for me.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is part 1 of a 2-part series covering the history of the relations between China and Cambodia. In this first half of the series, I present the early history. Some of this material was covered in the China-Vietnam series: Funan, Zhenla, and the Khmer Empire. This is a nice refresher if you forgot about that. Cambodia didn't have the same historical relations with China as their two neighbors and sometimes antagonizers, Thailand and Vietnam. A lot of what happened later on, in Part 2, had its roots in mid-19th century Cambodia. I hope this episode is useful as an intro to Cambodian history. We'll take things up to 1965 here and finish off next time.  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I discovered a whole bunch of new podcasts that are produced out of Singapore, Malaysia, HK, and the Philippines. My listening diet has always been heavy on US-UK-Australian shows. Podcasting is on the rise in Asia too. 1 Up Media, led by Singaporean Yeo Guang Jin has a couple of shows that are quite good. The first (I'm playing for you here) concerns the stories behind great business empires. They've done deep dives on Ten Cent, Sony, and Samsung so far. The show is called Empires: An Asian Business Podcast. <a href= "https://www.tiktok.com/@empirepod">https://www.tiktok.com/@empirepod</a> They also have another show that is sure to satisfy all imbibers of True Crime Podcasts. Over in Southeast Asia, they have their own murders and gruesomeness, some of which are featured in Heinous: An Asian True Crime Podcast. <a href= "https://www.tiktok.com/@heinous_1upmedia%20">https://www.tiktok.com/@heinous_1upmedia</a> Back when I started the CHP in 2010, podcasting was still in its infancy. Now in 2023 there are so many great shows behind produced all over the world by so many talented independent podcasters.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With the Taiwan series now behind us, it's onwards and upwards. This time I wanted to select one of the many great Chinese American heroes of his day, Chin Gee Hee. Chin was another Toisan native who came to the American west coast, not to the usual haunts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, but to Seattle. He arrived in the 1860s and stayed till 1904. Following a career in labor contracting and other entrepreneurial ventures that made him quite wealthy, he returned to his native Toisan where, together with a partner, he built the Sun Ning Railway 新宁铁路. The Sun Ning was one of the very few rail projects funded entirely by Chinese investors. During his decades living in the Washington Territory Chin Gee Hee faced the worst racism and anti-Chinese violence the future state would ever see. And when he returned to China during the final years of the Qing Dynasty to build his railroad, his best intentions encountered a different set of challenges and disappointments.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

The story concerns the two major states of Qí and Yān and the two minor (and mostly forgotten) states of Lìngzhī and Gūzhú. Two major and extremely consequential characters from those times star in this story. These were Duke Huán of Qí and his advisor Guǎn Zhòng.

Since the final years of the Obama presidency, the US-China relationship has been steadily deteriorating. And caught in the middle of this conflict is Taiwan. I hope this series has been helpful and useful to you. It ran a little long but it's a big story to tell. </p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings CHP listeners, whether you want it or not, here's the next episode of the CSP. The story behind our Chinese Saying for this time is quite recent as Chinese history goes. It takes place merely a thousand years ago, during the time of the Northern Song Dynasty. Just like location, location, location is what matters most in real estate, when it comes to getting ahead in your career, the same often holds true. One's location, relative to the boss, can sometimes make it or break it for you. As this story will show, if you're hoping to climb the ladder of success, sometimes a Jìn Shuǐ Lóu Tái 近水楼台 is all you need. A pavilion or a building near the water? How could that help an ambitious and aspiring bureaucrat in the government? Listen to this story that features the great Northern Song poet, politician, philosopher, writer, military strategist, and scholar-official, Fan Zhongyan.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chen Shuibian and Ma Ying-jeou both served two terms as president of the Republic of China. These years from 2000 to 2016 illustrated the glaring examples between the KMT and the DPP. Beginning with Taiwan's first DPP president, more and more things began to be said and actions taken that have provoked China and raised the anxiety levels of everyone familiar with the situation. In this episode, the eight years of Ma Ying-jeou (Mǎ Yīngjiǔ) brought anxiety levels down. But as shown from these past many episodes, attitudes on Taiwan about the mainland are mixed and not everyone was thrilled. Next episode in Part 15 we'll wind things down and conclude the Taiwan series. Thanks, everyone for listening.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You didn't ask for it. But you're getting it anyway. This week's Chinese Sayings Podcast reaches back all the way to those fateful years following the fall of the Qin Dynasty and the contentious period of conflict between Liu Bang of Han and Xiang Yu of Chu. As these two rivals battle it out, Liu Bang sought advice from one of his advisors on a plan of action. But as we'll see, that plan is blown out of the water by the great hero of the early Han, Zhang Liang. In order to persuade Liu Bang of the folly of this plan, Zhang Liang will 借箸代筹 Jiè Zhù Dài Chóu, borrow chopsticks to illustrate his strategy. And using these chopsticks as a prop to illustrate his point, Zhang Liang blows this advisor's good idea out of the water.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Be sure to check out the teacup.media website for a handy downloadable cheat sheet listing all the Chinese names and terms. This one has a fair number of characters and place names. The kind of inter-kingdom rivalries that were one of the hallmarks of the Eastern Zhou are front and center in this 7th-century BC tale.

Following the Sino-Soviet Split, Chiang Kai-shek had a funny feeling his U.S. ally was going to try to make hay of this opportunity. Facing an uncertain future Chiang front-burner'd economic reform.

Chiang knew the knock on the door was coming sooner or later. December 1969 he is told by the US ambassador the US will end things with the ROC in favor of recognizing the PRC. That created a very complicated and sensitive situation. The KMT starts grooming more native Taiwanese and carries out aggressive outreach. And we'll close off with the death of Chiang in April 1975.  </p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

With the three victorious campaigns of 1948-49, the Nationalists are cornered and The Great Retreat steps into high gear. Everything that Chiang will need to keep his regime going is moved to Taiwan. This included soldiers, government officials, and KMT members, gold, and cultural treasures from the past few thousand years of Chinese history. Once everything is settled on Taiwan Chiang carries out a purge and puts Chen Cheng in place to whip Taiwan into shape.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Surfing and China are two words I didn't think you could put together in the same sentence. It turns out not only is there a rather large surfing scene in China, there's also a history that dates back to the Song Dynasty. Italian Nik Zanella first came to China in 1993 and is now based in Surfer's Paradise of Western Hainan. He came out with a book several years ago called "Children of the Tide" (弄潮儿). Though the lion's share of China's surfing history is limited to the tidal bore of the Qiantang River, it's still a rather interesting and amusing story. Thanks to Mr. Nik Zanella for taking the time to appear on the CHP.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Laszlo had the honor and pleasure to welcome Mr. William Lindesay onto the CHP to discuss The Great Wall, a topic he is most eminently qualified to speak about. Sit back and enjoy this very informative and entertaining episode introducing the history and lore behind The Great Wall.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>More Taiwan history for you in Part 5. This time we only get as far as the first decade of the Japanese colonial period. Quite a bit of exciting and little-known stuff went down in Taiwan between the Treaty of Shimonoseki and the moment the Japanese tamped down major resistance, seized control, and got to photograph themselves under a "Mission Accomplished" banner. The first years were characterized by acts of defiance against the Japanese takeover. We'll also examine "Asia's first republic" and those five months from 1895. We also harken back to an old History of Tea episode to look at Li Chunsheng and John Dodd's contribution to launching Taiwan's tea industry. All of this and more for you in Part 5. I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to your emails and comments. </p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The history of Taiwan continues during the difficult decades of the Qing Dynasty. With Shi Lang's defeat of the Dongning Kingdom in 1683, Taiwan finally became part of China. But times were anything but peaceful on the island. The outcome of the Opium Wars had opened up treaty ports on Taiwan. Foreign trade ramped up quickly bringing with it all the positive and negative influences it had on the host country. The Manchu Qing authorities tried like crazy to establish control over the island. But with the indigenous people and the inaccessible mountainous parts of the island, they were never able to assert their authority beyond the west coast cities. A number of bloody incidents go down when foreign ships find themselves shipwrecked off the Taiwan coast. Finally, a hero arises who is able to begin to institute reforms. Liu Mingchuan first fought the French in the Sino-French War and then became the first governor of Taiwan...but not for long. We'll close with the Treaty of Shimonoseki which leads to a sharp turn of events on the Ilha Formosa.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this Part 2 episode, we will look at Dutch and Spanish Formosa and the history of these two would-be colonizers of Taiwan. The Dutch were the first to try and make a serious go at colonizing Taiwan. Zheng Zhilong and his famous son Zheng Chenggong will also be covered in this episode. Zheng Chenggong, better known in the West as Koxinga, is probably the most well-known person in Taiwan's history. He was responsible for removing the Dutch from Taiwan and opening the floodgates to the migration of thousands upon thousands of settlers from the Mainland. He also established the Dongning Kingdom on the island. Taiwan is still not yet part of China. But after Shi Lang is introduced in the next episode, that all changes.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Part 1 will take the story up to the Ming Dynasty.</p> <p>List of Chinese Terms Used: <a href= "https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fe269ae0da18965edaec1f9/t/6339c470295e81329a5dadcc/1664730225179/CHP-310+Terms+-+PDF+%281%29.pdf"> https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fe269ae0da18965edaec1f9/t/6339c470295e81329a5dadcc/1664730225179/CHP-310+Terms+-+PDF+%281%29.pdf</a></p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We're picking up in the Tang Dynasty. Guangzhou continues its leading role as the gateway to Southern China coming from the South China Sea and beyond. Heaven is high and the emperor is far away. Despite its importance to the dynasty even in the 7th century, Guangzhou was still a place of banishment and not yet completely integrated with everything happening in the north. Arab and Persian traders and diplomats were regular visitors to Guangzhou and enjoyed a mini-golden age of cultural and commercial interaction.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're picking up in the Tang Dynasty. Guangzhou continues its leading role as the gateway to Southern China coming from the South China Sea and beyond. Heaven is high and the emperor is far away. Despite its importance to the dynasty even in the 7th century, Guangzhou was still a place of banishment and not yet completely integrated with everything happening in the north. Arab and Persian traders and diplomats were regular visitors to Guangzhou and enjoyed a mini-golden age of cultural and commercial interaction. The Maritime Silk Road was in full bloom and Guangzhou was at the center of it. But all was not business as usual.</p> <p>Two violent disturbances will hit Guangzhou that shatters the peace. And Guangzhou's misfortune will become Quanzhou's opportunity. In this episode, we'll also look at the Southern Han Dynasty from the Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms period that followed the fall of the Tang. Liu Yan based his dynasty in Guangzhou and left behind ruins and relics that are still around today.

Long known as Canton in many places, this city has a history that is both fascinating and unique in China. In this installment of the series, we'll explore the early stories and legends from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Then we'll look at the period when the Guangzhou region first appears on the China map during the Qin. The story picks up the pace during Zhao Tuo's Nanyue Kingdom, a story told before in previous CHP episodes. Finally, we'll look at the Han and Three Kingdoms when there's no doubt about it, this part of southernmost China was here to stay and Guangzhou begins its integration with the rest of the Chinese nation. </p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Leigh for the inspiration to cover this sidebar to all the history happening during the end of the Qing and early Republic. This episode examines the lives of these late-Qing intellectuals who went to Paris, Tokyo, and other places to study alternative political systems that might be a good fit for China. Though anarchism works great only in theory, it was still an ideal these intellectuals aspired to. They sought to create a harmonious society where the people weren't persecuted or exploited by an oppressive government. The CCP ended up cherry-picking a few of these ideas that these anarchists wrote about in their journals and publications. These anarchists were the OG's of socialism and communism.

We ended last season in the Later Han Dynasty and that's where we'll start Season 5. Though this story was written during the Ming dynasty it concerns the 3rd Century character Sima Hui 司马徽.

			<description><![CDATA[For this 301st CHP episode, we cover some more great Overseas Chinese history. Rather than biting off more than I could chew by taking on the bigger story of Chinese emigration to the Caribbean, the focus will be on the island nation of Jamaica. The Chinese Jamaican story is another Hakka story. Contained in this episode is just one sliver of the history of this great and musical nation. I hope this episode piques your interest. If you want to learn more about Jamaica you're in luck. Lots of great resources out there. I hope I can visit there one day and see it for myself. I flipped a coin to decide what pronunciation of "Caribbean" I would use for the episode. Happy Memorial Day Weekend to all fellow Yanks.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm happy to welcome Dr. Brandon Gauthier onto the CHP. His new book, just out, "Before Evil" looks at the early lives of six dictators: Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, and Kim Il-Sung. In this discussion, we'll mainly look at Mao's early life. Despite only focusing on one of the six dictators, this lively chat runs for about an hour. Since I've never presented Mao in a standalone series, this is a nice talk about a topic not covered in any previous CHP episode. Link to purchase "Before Evil":</p> <p> https://www.amazon.com/dp/1948954613/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_X4V152TM2M5EA3N0F1G3</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[This episode is another listener request. In fact, Homer Lea's been requested regularly throughout the years. He's more of a footnote from history than actual history itself. Homer's story is kind of unique because of the stumbling blocks life threw his way. He didn't live long but in his short life he got to witness a lot and be a sort of "fly on the wall" to some of the great moments in Revolutionary Chinese history that we're all so familiar with. So let's go relive those years from 1908 to 1912 and the walk-on roles Homer Lea got to play as history unfolded. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Before we tuck into the chicken ribs that are Sino-Roman Relations, I'll introduce you to the far-out theory that Professor Homer Dubs came up with in the 1950s. A lot of people swear this happened. Then we'll look at the famous Gan Ying mission of 97 AD and take it from there. In Part 2 we'll look at the events that happened mostly during the Byzantine Empire.

			<description><![CDATA[Documentarian and podcaster James Harper of Filter Stories has joined up with history professor Jonathan Morris to produce a nice, short but sweet, six-part series that looks at the history of this aromatic psychoactive seed that, like tea, played no small part in changing the world. If you liked the tea history series, I warmly welcome you to go check this one out from James and Jonathan that examines the impact of the coffee trade on world history.  Behind that goodness that many of us enjoy once or several times daily, there’s a centuries-long history that is both fascinating and at times, quite dark. Like with the history of tea, many people in the first links of the coffee supply chain faced all manners of little-known human suffering. I invite you to listen. Only six episodes. Enjoy it with your morning cuppa. Did you know coffee is also produced in China? Yeah, the PRC is one of the top 20 producers in the world. Almost all the coffee in China is overwhelmingly grown in Yunnan Province, the same place where the original tea gardens existed thousands and thousands of years ago. You can learn all about this too in A History of Coffee. Links to the show can be found in the episode show notes.

			<description><![CDATA[In this 293rd CHP episode, we feature the Sriracha Chili Sauce King, David Tran. His life is a great immigrant success story and an inspiration to many aspiring immigrants and entrepreneurs. It's not often that a living person is featured on the CHP. David Tran's ancestors came from the Chaozhou region of China and emigrated to Vietnam in the 19th century. After a traumatic turn of events that forced him to flee his country, he ended up on the US west coast. There he went on to build his dream and ultimately become another great American immigrant success story. His culinary creation, Sriracha chili sauce, and his company, Huy Fong Foods, became a huge sensation in the US and later, all over the world.  <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

After being dealt a heavy blow in the Yan Baohang and Zhang Shuping spy cases, Dai found himself back on his heels with a legion of haters trying to tear him down. But it's always darkest before the dawn. And after Pearl Harbor and the sudden proliferation of Americans in Chongqing and other parts of China, opportunity knocked on Dai Li's door. SACO is born after Dai Li and Milton Miles meet and begin to discuss cooperating against the Japanese in China. It won't be long after SACO is operational that Dai uses the resources of the organization to also go after his and the KMT's political enemies, the CCP most of all.

The dreaded Blue Shirts are introduced along with Dai Li's rise up the ladder hanging on the coattails of Chiang. He demonstrates his undying loyalty to the Generalissimo during the Xian Incident and sets up the organization that made him famous, the innocuous-sounding Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, a.k.a. The Juntong. We finish off the episode with Dai uncovering a devastating Communist-led spy ring operating inside the sanctum sanctorum of his organization.

			<description><![CDATA[In this Part 1 of a 3 episode series covering the life and times of Dai Li, we look at his early beginnings, living the thug life in Shanghai and falling in with all the right people. We'll trace his quick rise up the ranks of Chiang Kai-shek's formidable spy agencies. He was often called "China's Himmler" due to his slavish devotion to his boss, Chiang Kai-shek, and for his role in setting up Chiang's secret police and spy agencies.

			<description><![CDATA[Though the villainous empresses always seem to generate the most popular interest, this time we'll look at the life of one of the many good ones, an outstanding one if I may add. Empress Zhangsun was the bride of Tang Dynasty heavy Li Shimin. When he became the second Tang emperor following one of the most dramatic events in early Chinese history, he reigned as Emperor Taizong. We remember Empress Zhangsun for her decency and for deporting herself in a manner that Yao and Confucius both would have approved. She became the gold standard for future empresses and was often imitated but seldom replicated. Come relive those early years of Zhenguan Era (貞觀) Tang history.

			<description><![CDATA[On October 24th, 1871 the Los Angeles Chinatown Massacre took place near the present-day location of Union Station, just north of the core downtown L.A. area. Though mostly unknown rather than forgotten, this incident that happened one hundred fifty years ago this month will be remembered through a number of commemorative events. The Chinese American Museum (today located adjacent to where the atrocities occurred) will sponsor one event. My friend, Scripps College professor Hao Huang will be participating in another event that will memorialize this tragic event in local L.A. history. Well-known and respected L.A. Chinatown scholar and activist Eugene Moy will also be among the speakers at this event. The links to both are shown below. In this CHP episode, I tell the story of the massacre and how it all went down on that tragic day. If you have time, I encourage everyone to check out these events that will offer an excellent perspective on what happened and the lessons we can all learn from it.

			<description><![CDATA[We're going to wind things down with this episode. 1863-1864, the bitter and bloody end of the Taiping Rebellion. Charles George Gordon has his walk-on but Zeng Guofan and brother Zeng Guoquan take the limelight in the ultimate showdown with the Taiping holdouts. When it was all over, the Taiping Rebellion ended up having quite a consequential impact on China's trajectory into the 20th century. We'll close things up by looking at the historical blowback from this terrible civil war.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After the Convention of Beijing was signed in 1860, the foreign pers weren't so sure about the Taiping's anymore. For the sake of preserving their hard-won gains in the Second Opium War, they hopped down off that fence and sided with the Qing forces. In this episode, we hear about Frederick Townshend Ward and the Ever Victorious Army. 1862 was the pivotal year for the allies lined up against the Taiping rebels. Victory was still a couple years away but it was well within sight at least.

			<description><![CDATA[The history of the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is rich with all kinds of lesser-known or forgotten tales, like this one. A kongsi 公司 today means a company. But when Chinese immigrants from Eastern Guangdong and Southern Fujian were heading in the direction of West Borneo to engage in gold mining, kongsis were established as associations where its members were organized and led.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is Part 1 of a four-part series focusing on the Chinese history that happened in one of China's oldest provinces. In Part 1 we get the lay of the land in Henan, discuss its mythical beginnings as well as the neolithic cultures of Peiligang, Yangshao, Longshan, and Erlitou. We also take the offramp to look at a couple of the more well-known Henan dishes. We'll get as far as the Xia and Shang dynasties and a little of the Western Zhou. All the Chinese terms from this episode (and there's a LOT of them this time) can be viewed in Pinyin, Chinese characters, and English at the website at: https://teacup.media/chinahistorypodcastepisodes/ep-273-henan-province-part-1</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

This time around we wind things down with eunuchs during the time of the Last Emperor Puyi in the course of his residency in the Forbidden City, Tianjin and Manchukuo. Then we look briefly at the life of the Last Eunuch Sun Yaoting and the Ming Dynasty "good eunuch" Tian Yi.

Subsequent emperors were either too weak or too young to push back against eunuchs who, once given an inch of authority, took a mile more and never let go. They grew in power and venality at the expense of the dynasty's fortunes. Finally they drove it into the ground. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[This is the Du Fu episode. Along with Li Bai, discussed last episode, he's considered the greatest poet in Chinese history. That's of course a matter of opinion. We'll take a brief look at the rough road Du Fu had to walk most of his years. In addition to looking at his life we'll hear a few of his regulated verse poems. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[Li Bai is showcased in this fourth installment of Laszlo's not very deep dive into the history of Tang poetry. We're still in the High Tang period of Chinese poetry. This episode will focus more on Li Bai's story (and legend) rather than an in-depth analysis of his poetry. He, along with several other poets from this time are cultural icons and treasures of the Chinese people. Check the links and resources for other scholarly and biographical info on Li Bai, Du Fu and other great Tang poets. This episode is especially geared towards those CHP listeners who may have never heard these names before. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Please come back for Part 3 where we'll finally get to the early Tang (maybe). <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

In this episode we enter the 20th century and explore the end of French domination in Indochina, Vietnam's fight to unify the country and the most recent Sino-Viet history. Although this six-part series was only a simple 走马看花 overview of the subject, I hope anyone not schooled in the basics of this history is leaving the table satisfied.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Laszlo looks at U.S. Immigration during the bad old days of Chinese Exclusion. The subject will be examined through the telling of the stories of three rather plain and non-extraordinary brothers from Haiyang Village in Toi San (Taishan in Mandarin). These three Moy brothers were featured in Scott Seligman's 2013 book "Three Tough Chinamen" (Earnshaw Books). In addition to the Chinese Exclusion laws, Laszlo briefly introduces the life of another Toisanese, Ng Poon Chew. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The mid 19th Century brought another sea change to the tea industry. Demand continued to grow all over Europe and North America. China's tea industry, which depended mainly on countless artisanal tea growers rather than a few large-scale producers, creates bottlenecks and unreliability in the tea supply chain. The demand had become more than China's exporters could handle.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea in 2021 to resurrect this old episode from mid-2014 that tells the story of Wong Chin Foo (王清福). His spirit is alive and well in many of today's Chinese-Americans who are standing up to anti-Asian sentiment across the country. Like Wing Chin Foo did in the 1870s and 80's, Chinese-American community leaders and citizens are not standing idly by and are fighting back. Wong Chin Foo's story is a good one to listen to. One of my favorite episodes.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices. Visit <a href= "https://megaphone.fm/adchoices">megaphone.fm/adchoices</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[We close out our three-part series on the amazing life of Admiral Zheng He and his seven voyages. This time the CHP looks at retired submarine commander Gavin Menzies and his take on what Zheng He achieved. He makes some wild claims that have been savagely attacked by educated people around the world. If not for the fact that early Ming China was advanced enough to carry out these voyages, as Menzies said they happened, they’d be very hard to believe. The debate is far from closed on this subject. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

			<description><![CDATA[Laszlo is happily back in Cali with a new episode that looks at the early years of Deng Xiaoping. Most of the narrative is based on passages gleaned from Ezra Vogel’s new biography of The Great One.  Inspired by the events of May Fourth, 1919, Deng Xiaoping was a lifelong revolutionary and by the end of his days had personally seen to it that China ended up the nation it was meant to be on the world stage.  In this multi-part series on the life of Deng Xiaoping, we’ll trace his life, all the triumphs as well as the tragedies. We’ll look at why he is lionized as one of the greatest 20th-century world leaders and also why some have vilified Deng for his actions. His life itself is an interesting prism from which to view 20th century China. <p>Learn more about your ad choices.

These are all tales mostly culled from Sima Qian's "Record of the Grand Historian". These were mythical times but many of the figures discussed in today's episode reappear constantly throughout Chinese history. These founding myths of China and the Huaxia People are a good place to start. Next time we'll look at the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC). Thanks for listening.</p> <p>Learn more about your ad choices.
