      <title>314 - Fluke - Brian Klaas (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we sit down with Brian Klaas, author of Fluke, and get into the existential lessons and grander meaning for a life well-lived (once one finally accepts the power and influence of randomness, chaos, and chance). In addition, we learn not to fall prey to proportionality bias - the tendency for human brains to assume big, historical, or massively impactful events must have had big causes and/or complex machinations underlying their grand outcomes. It’s one of the cognitive biases that most contributes to conspiratorial thinking and grand conspiracy theories, one that leads to an assumption that there must be something more going on when big, often unlikely, events make the evening news. Yet, as Brian explains, events big and small are often the result of random inputs in complex systems interacting in ways that are difficult to predict.</p><p><a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/">Previous Episodes</a></p><p><a href="https://brianpklaas.com/">Brian Klaas</a></p><p><a href="https://brianpklaas.com/fluke">Fluke</a></p><p><a href="https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome">How Minds Change</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmcraney">David McRaney’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidmcraney.bsky.social">David McRaney’s BlueSky</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/notsmartblog">YANSS Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/youarenotsosmart/">YANSS Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com/">Newsletter</a></p><p><a href="https://kitted.shop/">Kitted</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon</a></p><p> </p>

The feelings are usually undeniable, but our explanations for why we feel the way we feel can be wildly inaccurate, and because of that, our resulting behavior can be, let’s say, sub-optimal.

Jacobs, a journalist who noticed some striking similarities between Biblical fundamentalism and constitutional originalism, and since he once wrote a NYT bestselling book about titled The Year of Living Biblically in which he tried to live for a year as a fundamentalist, he tried to do something similar by living for a year following the Constitution's original meaning as if he were an originalist and then writing a book about it.

He soon learned that donning a tricorne hat and marching around Manhattan with a 1700s musket, though fully within one's constitutional rights, will quickly lead to some difficult encounters and altogether strange circumstances.</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622521/the-year-of-living-constitutionally-by-aj-jacobs/">The Year of Living Constitutionally</a></p><p><a href="https://ajjacobs.com">AJ Jacobs' Website</a><br /><br /><a href="https://x.com/ajjacobs">AJ Jacobs' Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome">How Minds Change</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmcraney">David McRaney’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/notsmartblog">YANSS Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://kitted.shop/referred-by-davidmcraney66">Kitted Shop</a></p><p><a href="https://kitted.app/article/kitted/the-story-of-kitted/0051">The Story of Kitted</a></p><p><a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/">Show Notes</a></p><p><a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com/">Newsletter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon</a></p>

      <title>290 - The Intention Action Gap - Britt Frank</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with therapist Britt Frank to discuss the intention action gap, the psychological term for the chasm between what you very much intend to do and what you tend to do instead. It turns out, there's a well-researched psychological framework that includes a term for when you have a stated, known goal – a change you'd like to make in your life – something you wake up intending to finally do or get started doing, but then don't do while knowing full well you are actively not doing what you ought and wish you had done by now. After we discuss this phenomenon and how to deal with it, we get into procrastination and how to escape all manner of dead-end behavioral loops. </p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/731229/the-getting-unstuck-workbook-by-britt-frank-lscw/">The Getting Unstuck Workbook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.scienceofstuck.com">The Science of Stuck</a></p><p><a href="https://kitted.shop/referred-by-davidmcraney66">Kitted Shop</a></p><p><a href="https://kitted.app/article/kitted/the-story-of-kitted/0051">The Story of Kitted</a></p><p><a href="https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome">How Minds Change</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmcraney">David McRaney’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/notsmartblog">YANSS Twitter</a></p><p><a href="www.youarenotsosmart.com">Show Notes</a></p><p><a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com">Newsletter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we sit down with Brian Klaas, author of Fluke,  to get into the existential lessons and grander meaning for a life well-lived once one finally accepts the power and influence of randomness, chaos, and chance. In addition, we learn not to fall prey to proportionality bias - the tendency for human brains to assume big, historical, or massively impactful events must have had big causes and/or complex machinations underlying their grand outcomes. It’s one of the cognitive biases that most contributes to conspiratorial thinking and grand conspiracy theories, one that leads to an assumption that there must be something more going on when big, often unlikely, events make the evening news. Yet, as Brian explains, events big and small are often the result of random inputs in complex systems interacting in ways that are difficult to predict.</p><p><a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/">Previous Episodes</a></p><p><a href="https://brianpklaas.com">Brian Klaas</a></p><p><a href="https://brianpklaas.com/fluke">Fluke</a></p><p><a href="https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome" target="_blank">How Minds Change</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmcraney" target="_blank">David McRaney’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/notsmartblog" target="_blank">YANSS Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com/" target="_blank">Newsletter</a></p><p><a href="www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are several ways to define pluralistic ignorance, and that’s because it’s kind of a brain twister when you try to put it into words. On certain issues, most people people believe that most people believe what, in truth, few people believe. Or put another way, it is the erroneous belief that the majority is acting in a way that matches its internal philosophies, and that you are one of a small number of people who feel differently, when in reality the majority agrees with you on the inside but is afraid to admit it outright or imply such through its behavior. Everyone in a group, at the same time, gets stuck following a norm that no one wants to follow, because everyone is carrying a shared, false belief about everyone else’s unshared true beliefs.</p><p><a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/person/deborah-prentice">Deborah Prentice’s Website</a></p><p><a href="https://www.robbwiller.org/">Robb Willer’s Website</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=GhostfaceWiller">Robb Willer’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome">How Minds Change</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmcraney">David McRaney’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/notsmartblog">YANSS Twitter</a></p><p><a href="www.youarenotsosmart.com">Show Notes</a></p><p><a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com">Newsletter</a></p>

Drawing on stories from elite athletes like Mount Everest climbers, founders of leading companies like Stewart Butterfield, the CEO of Slack, and top entertainers like Dave Chappelle, Duke explains why quitting is integral to success, as well as strategies for determining when to hold em, and when to fold em, that will save you time, energy, and money.</p><p><br />• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-aAFz0ala0&t=1s">Connections</a></p><p>• <a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com">Newsletter</a></p><p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnieDuke">Annie Duke's Twitter</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.annieduke.com/books/">Annie Duke’s Website</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.schoolofthought.org">School of Thought</a></p><p>• <a href="https://theconspiracytest.org">The Conspiracy Test</a></p><p>• <a href="https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org">The Alliance for Decision Education</a></p><p>• <a href="https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/podcasts/">The Decision Education Podcast</a></p><p>• <a href="www.youarenotsosmart.com">Show Notes</a></p>

      <title>269 - Deconstructing How Minds Change - Michael Taft</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In celebration of How Minds Change, my new book, turning one-year-old, in this episode Michael Taft interviews David McRaney about how minds do and do not change, the process behind writing a book about that, and what he has learned since writing and promoting it.</p><p>Michael is a meditation teacher, bestselling author, and  a mindfulness coach – and he specializes in secular, science-based mindfulness training. If you are interested in a science-based, secular book about meditation and and mindfulness, I highly recommend his book,The Mindful Geek, snd I recommend guided meditation with him. He offers that at The Alembic in Berkeley. You can join them virtually, over the internet. Links below.</p><p>I also recommend his podcast, Deconstructing Yourself. It is all about entheogens and neurofeedback and brain hacking. If you are a Carl Sagan loving, science endorsing, evidence based sort of person – a nerd, geek, or skeptic or humanist who wants to know more about meditation and deep dive into what we do and do not know about it – that's what his podcast is about. Sam Harris will be a guest on there soon, and I think many of you will love that episode.<br /><br /><a href="https://deconstructingyourself.com">Deconstructing Yourself</a></p><p><a href="http://berkeleyalembic.org">The Alembic</a></p><p><a href="https://deconstructingyourself.com/michael-w-taft">Michael Taft</a></p><p><a href="https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome">How Minds Change</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmcraney">David McRaney’s Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/notsmartblog">YANSS Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com">Show Notes</a></p><p><a href="https://davidmcraney.substack.com/">Newsletter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When we talk about conspiracy theories we tend to focus on what people believe instead of why, and, more importantly, why they believe <em>those</em> things and not other things. In this episode, we sit down with two psychologists working to change that, and in addition, change the term itself from conspiracy theory to conspiracy narrative, which more accurately describes what makes any one conspiracy appealing enough to form a community around it and in rare cases result in collective action.</p>

<p>Deliberation. Debate. Conversation. Though it can feel like that’s what we are doing online as we trade arguments back and forth, most of the places where we currently gather make it much easier to produce arguments in isolation rather than evaluate them together in groups. The latest research suggests we will need much more of the latter if we hope to create a new, modern, functioning marketplace of ideas.

Deliberation. Debate. Conversation. Though it can feel like that’s what we are doing online as we trade arguments back and forth, most of the places where we currently gather make it much easier to produce arguments in isolation rather than evaluate them together in groups. The latest research suggests we will need much more of the latter if we hope to create a new, modern, functioning marketplace of ideas.

If so, what does that say about opinions, our arguments, and in the end, our minds?</p>

      <itunes:summary>This episode, featuring Andy Luttrell of the Opinion Science Podcast, is all about a machine, built by IBM, that can debate human beings on any issue, which leads to the question: is persuasion, with language, using arguments, and the ability to alter another person’s attitudes, beliefs, values, opinions, and behavior a uniquely human phenomenon, or could you be persuaded to change your mind by an artificial intelligence designed to do just that? If so, what does that say about opinions, our arguments, and in the end, our minds?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Not all surprises trigger change, but almost all change is triggered by surprise. In this episode, Micheal Rousell, author of The Power of Surprise, explains the science of surprise at the level of neurons and brain structures, and then talk about how surprises often lead to the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, the different personal narratives that guide our behaviors and motivations and goals, and, perhaps most importantly, our willingness to be surprised again so that we can change and grow.</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <title>217 - Livewired - David Eagleman (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we sit down with neuroscientist David Eagleman to learn how brains turn noise into signal, chaos into order, electrical spikes into meaning, and how new technology can expand subjective reality in ways never before possible. </p>
<p>In his new book, Livewired, Eagleman explores how brains come into the world "half baked" so they can create reality itself out of the inputs and experiences available. And now, thanks to that plug-and-play plasticity, with the latest tools, not only can we return senses to people who've lost them, but we can add to any brain senses we can't imagine. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we sit down with neuroscientist David Eagleman to learn how brains turn noise into signal, chaos into order, electrical spikes into meaning, and how new technology can expand subjective reality in ways never before possible. </p>
<p>In his new book, Livewired, Eagleman explores how brains come into the world "half baked" so they can create reality itself out of the inputs and experiences available. And now, thanks to that plug-and-play plasticity, with the latest tools, not only can we return senses to people who've lost them, but we can add to any brain senses we can't imagine. </p>

      <title>215 - Jerks at Work - Tessa West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this live taping of the podcast at Caveat in NYC, Dr. Tessa West, the author of Jerks at Work, conducts quizzes to see what kind of jerk you are and what kind of jerk most-easily persuades you in the workplace. You will also learn how to counteract the behaviors of people who make work suck more than it should. </p>
<p>West is a leading expert on interpersonal interaction and communication and will explain how to make work suck less as we return to our offices and figure out how to balance working remotely with working in-person after a year of re-imagining what work even means. West’s new book is an exploration of all the psychological research into how and why gaslighters, bulldozers, neglectors, micromanagers and more do their thing in our workplaces and how to use what we know from decades of psychological research to counteract their Machiavellian machinations.</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <title>212 - The Power of Us - Jay Van Bavel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with psychologist Jay Van Bavel to discuss his new book, <a href="https://www.powerofus.online/">The Power of Us</a>, an exploration of "the dynamics of shared, social identities. What causes people to develop social identities? What happens to people when they define themselves in terms of group memberships? Under what conditions does the human proclivity to divide the world into “us” and “them” produce toxic conflict and devastating discrimination? And how can shared identities instead be harnessed to improve performance, increase cooperation, and promote social harmony?"</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest on this episode is Dr. Julia Shaw, the author of <a href="https://www.drjuliashaw.com/thememoryillusion"><em>The Memory Illusion</em></a>.</p>
<p>Julia is famous among psychologists because she was able to implant false memories into a group of subjects and convince 70 percent of them that they were guilty of a crime they did not commit, and she did so by using the sort of sloppy interrogation techniques that some police departments have been truly been guilty of using in the past.</p>
<p>From her book’s website: “In <a href="https://www.drjuliashaw.com/thememoryillusion"><em>The Memory Illusion</em></a>, Dr Julia Shaw uses the latest research to show the astonishing variety of ways in which our memory can indeed be led astray. Fascinating and unnerving in equal measure, the international bestseller <em>The Memory Illusion</em> has been translated into 20 languages and offers a unique insight into the human brain, challenging you to question how much you can ever truly know about yourself.”</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

In other words, our minds are not, as she puts it, brainbound, but they extend to our computers, our notebooks, our friends and neighbors and colleagues and partners. The environments in which we move, natural and otherwise, deeply influence how we think, what we think, and what we CAN think, and in addition, everything the brain does becomes a reference for extended thinking, and these feedback loops extend what the mind can do.</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

So, as podcasters do from time to time, Maya wondered if she could come on this podcast to promote her podcast, and seeing as our interests and obsessions and work and overall mission aligned so strongly, I said, &quot;Absolutely, I would love that,&quot; and this is that episodeShow Notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.comPatreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>206 - Narcissism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we explore what narcissism is and what is most-definitely is not. You will learn is that narcissists are not psychopaths, and vice-versa, but there is a form of narcissism which had been, up until now, confused with psychopathy, and vice-versa. According to the research of the two psychologists in this episode, narcissism may even need to be renamed, because it isn't excessive self-love, it's excessive self-loathing. Narcissists like Don Draper in Mad Men cope with their insecurity by donning a mask, and then spend most of their lives protecting that mask out of a fear of what will happen if people ever see what it hides.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with neurologist Robert Burton, author of On Being Certain, a book that fundamentally changed the way I think about what a belief actually is. That’s because the book posits that conclusions are not conscious choices and certainty is not even a thought process. Certainty and similar states of “knowing” as he puts it, are "sensations that feel like thoughts, but arise out of involuntary brain mechanisms that function independently of reason."</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <title>203 - Transcend - Scott Barry Kaufman</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we sit down with Scott Barry Kaufman, one of the most-influential and prolific psychologists working today, to discuss his new book, Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization.</p>
<p>Business Insider magazine named Kaufman one of the “50 groundbreaking scientists who are changing the way we see the world,” and you would agree after hanging out with him. In my experience, you feel seen, heard, respected, challenged, and above all, when you leave a conversation with Scott, you do so feeling either like you must work on your purpose in life from that point on, or you must work to find it.</p>
<p>In the show, we discuss our shared desire to bring humanistic psychology back to the forefront and walk through Kaufman’s re-imagining of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and trace Kaufman’s journey through Maslow’s unpublished journals about his unfinished theory of transcendence which Kaufman hopes to complete by picking up where Maslow left off just before his untimely death.</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <title>200 - Socks and Crocs (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When facing a novel and uncertain situation, the brain secretly disambiguates the ambiguous without letting you know it was ever uncertain in the first place, leading people who disambiguate differently to seem iNsAnE.</p>
<p>This episode is about why we so often don't understand why we disagree, which leads us to disagree even more, and we explore that through the science behind The Dress. We look into why some people see it as black and blue, others see it as white and gold, and how the scientific investigation of why that is led to the scientific investigation of socks and Crocs, and how the scientific investigation of socks and Crocs may be, as one researcher explains, the nuclear bomb of cognitive neuroscience.</p>

      <title>194 - Because Internet - Gretchen McCulloch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest in this episode is Gretchen McCulloch, who is a linguist, but also, I’d say a MEME-ologist, evidenced by that the fact that in her New York Times Bestselling book, <em>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language</em>, she spends a good portion of the book tracing the history of memes and how we have used them all the way up to right now, which is part of her her overall exploration of how language itself has changed since the advent of text messaging, SnapChat, TikTok, emojis, gifs, memes, and the internet as a whole.</p>
<p>If you still put periods at the ends of your texts and refuse to change your ways, you will definitely enjoy this interview, and if you fancy yourself some kind of memelord, this is certainly the episode for you.  </p>

      <title>192 - The Dunning-Kruger Effect (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we explore why we are unaware that we lack the skill to tell how unskilled and unaware we are. <br /><br />The evidence gathered so far by psychologists and neuroscientists seems to suggest that each one of us has a relationship with our own ignorance, a dishonest, complicated relationship, and that dishonesty keeps us sane, happy, and willing to get out of bed in the morning. Part of that ignorance is a blind spot we each possess that obscures both our competence and incompetence called the Dunning-Kruger Effect. <br /><br />It's a psychological phenomenon that arises sometimes in your life because you are generally very bad at self-assessment. If you have ever been confronted with the fact that you were in over your head, or that you had no idea what you were doing, or that you thought you were more skilled at something than you actually were – then you may have experienced this effect. It is very easy to be both unskilled and unaware of it, and in this episode we explore why that is with professor David Dunning, one of the researchers who coined the term and a scientist who continues to add to our understanding of the phenomenon.<br /><br />• Show Notes: youarenotsosmart.com<br /><br />• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />• Donate Directly through PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney<br /><br /></p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <title>191 - Livewired - David Eagleman</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we sit down with neuroscientist David Eagleman to learn how brains turn noise into signal, chaos into order, electrical spikes into meaning, and how new technology can expand subjective reality in ways never before possible. <br /><br />In his new book, Livewired, Eagleman explores how brains come into the world "half baked" so they can create reality itself out of the inputs and experiences available. And now, thanks to that plug-and-play plasticity, with the latest tools, not only can we return senses to people who've lost them, but we can add to any brain senses we can't imagine. <br /><br />- Show notes at: <a href="https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youarenotsosmart.com&token=120ae6-1-1603036794081">www.youarenotsosmart.com</a><br />- Become a patron at: <a href="https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fyouarenotsosmart&token=1604cd-1-1603036794081">www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a><br /><br /></p>

      <title>186 - Maybe You Should Talk to Someone - Lori Gottlieb (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In Lori Gottlieb's new book, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, she opens with a quote from James Baldwin that reads, "Nothing is more desirable than to be released from an affliction, but nothing is more frightening than to be divested of a crutch."</p>
<p>In this episode, we talk about therapy, how it works, the misconceptions around it, and how people go from resisting change to embracing the behaviors required to alter their own thoughts and feelings when stuck in destructive, unhealthy loops. You'll also learn the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion.</p>

      <title>181 - Pluralistic Ignorance (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are several ways to define pluralistic ignorance, and that’s because it’s kind of a brain twister when you try to put it into words. On certain issues, the majority of the people believe that the majority of the people in a group believe what, in truth, the minority of the members believe. Or put another way, it is the erroneous belief that the majority is acting in a way that matches its internal philosophies, and that you are one of a small number of people who feel differently, when in reality the majority agrees with you on the inside but is afraid to admit it outright or imply such through its behavior. Everyone in a group, at the same time, gets stuck following a norm that no one wants to follow, because everyone is carrying a shared, false belief about everyone else’s unshared true beliefs.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Flatten the curve.<br /><br />That idea has spread through the population faster than COVID-19 ever could.<br /><br />That’s the power of culture, of human psychology, of brains interacting with brains. Of course, culture and human psychology and brains interacting with brains are also how the virus spread to begin to with, and that is what this show is about — the psychology behind the spread, and the prevention of the spread, of COVID-19.<br /><br />When I asked followers on Twitter what kind of show they would want if I did a show about the psychology of this moment, the answer I received the most was, “Why aren’t people staying at home?” so, that’s the first thing we talk about (even though we may soon be asking, &quot;Why DIDN'T people stay at home?&quot;)<br /><br />The second most-asked question was “how do we persuade people, in times like this, to take precautions and follow guidelines?&quot; so that is segment two. And the other topic most requested was how do to deal with anxiety and loneliness and relationships right now. So, that is segment three.<br /><br />This is a show with six experts, answering all of this, across three segments: Why we respond to situations like this in the way that we do, how to encourage people to respond differently both now and in the future, and how to take care of yourself during a long period of isolation?<br /><br />- SEGMENT ONE: 5:00<br />- SEGMENT TWO: 50:00<br />- SEGMENT THREE: 1:18:00<br /><br />Oh, and #GoVictorian<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses Plus -- www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/SMART<br /><br />• BetterHelp -- Offer code: YANSS -- www.betterhelp.com/YANSS<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Priors are what neuroscientists and philosophers call the years of experience and regularity leading up to the present. All the ways a ball has bounced, all the ways a pancake has tasted, the way the dogs in your life have barks, or bitten, or hugged you when you were sad -- these all shape the brain, literally. They form and prune our neural networks, so in situations that are uncertain, unfamiliar or ambiguous, we depend on those priors to help us disambiguate the new information coming into the brain via our senses.<br /><br />But what happens when we don't share those priors?<br /><br />This episode is about the science behind The Dress, why some people see it as black and blue, and others see it as white and gold. But it’s also about how the scientific investigation of The Dress lead to the scientific investigation of socks and Crocs, and how the scientific investigation of socks and Crocs may be, as one researcher told me, the nuclear bomb of cognitive neuroscience.<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• Brooklinen: www.brooklinen.com -- Offer code: YANSS<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

It isn’t norms themselves that predict how cultures will react, evolve, innovate, and clash -- but how different cultures value those and sanction people who violate them.

      <title>172 - Team Human - Douglas Rushkoff (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast we sit down with one of the original cyberpunks, the famed journalist, documentarian, media theorist, all-around technology superstar and weirdo, Douglas Rushkoff.<br /><br />MIT considers Rushkoff one of the &quot;world's ten most influential thinkers,&quot; and in the episode we talk about his latest (and 20th) book, Team Human.<br /><br />The book is a bit of a manifesto in which he imagines a new counterculture that would revolt against the algorithms that are slowly altering our collective behavior for the benefit of shareholders. Instead, he implores us, we should curate a digital, psychedelic substrate that embraces the messiness of human beings: our unpredictability, our pursuit of novelty and innovation, and our primate/animal/social connectedness.<br /><br />The book is presented in a series of aphorisms that add up to a rallying cry for building communities outside of what the machines that tend our walled gardens might suggest we build. As the title suggests, he would prefer that we turned our technological attention to encouraging and facilitating teamwork.<br /><br />In the book, he says that any technology whose initial purpose is to connect people will eventually become colonized and repurposed to repress and isolate them. But, the good news is that we’ve seen this pattern so often that we can now stop it in its tracks and choose to build something else. In the interview, you’ll hear what his thoughts are on all this -- and much more.<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>157 - Pluralistic Ignorance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are several ways to define pluralistic ignorance, and that’s because it’s kind of a brain twister when you try to put it into words. On certain issues, the majority of the people believe that the majority of the people in a group believe what, in truth, the minority of the members believe. Or put another way, it is the erroneous belief that the majority is acting in a way that matches its internal philosophies, and that you are one of a small number of people who feel differently, when in reality the majority agrees with you on the inside but is afraid to admit it outright or imply such through its behavior. Everyone in a group, at the same time, gets stuck following a norm that no one wants to follow, because everyone is carrying a shared, false belief about everyone else’s unshared true beliefs. <br /><br />-- Show Notes at: youarenotsosmart.com --<br /><br />-- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart --<br /><br /></p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with author Will Storr to talk about his new book -- Selfie: How We Became so Self-Obsessed, and What it is Doing to Us.<br /><br />The book explores what he calls “the age of perfectionism” -- our modern struggle to meet newly emerging ideals and standards that tell us we are falling short of the person we ought to be. As he says in the book, &quot;Perfectionism is the idea that kills,&quot; and you’ll hear him explain what he means by that in the interview.<br /><br />-- Show Notes at: youarenotsosmart.com --<br /><br />-- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart --<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses Plus: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with author Will Storr to talk about his new book -- Selfie: How We Became so Self-Obsessed, and What it is Doing to Us.<br /><br />The book explores what he calls “the age of perfectionism” -- our modern struggle to meet newly emerging ideals and standards that tell us we are falling short of the person we ought to be. As he says in the book, &quot;Perfectionism is the idea that kills,&quot; and you’ll hear him explain what he means by that in the interview.<br /><br />-- Show Notes at: youarenotsosmart.com --<br /><br />-- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart --<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses Plus: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>150 - Belief Change Blindness (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you changed your mind? Are you sure?<br /><br />In this episode we explore new research that suggests for the majority of the mind change we experience, after we update our priors, we delete what we used to believe and then simply forget that we ever thought otherwise.<br /><br />In the show, psychologists Michael Wolfe and Todd Williams, take us though their new research which suggests that because brains so value consistency, and are so determined to avoid the threat of decoherence, we hide the evidence of our belief change. That way, the story we tell ourselves about who we are can remain more or less heroic, with a stable, steadfast protagonist whose convictions rarely waver -- or, at least, they don’t waver as much as those of shifty, flip-flopping politicians.<br /><br />This can lead to a skewed perception of the world, one that leads to the assumption that mind change is rare and difficult-to-come-by. And that can lead to our avoiding information that might expand our understanding of the world, because we assume it will have no impact.<br /><br />The truth, say Wolfe and Williams, is that mind change is so prevalent and constant, that the more you expose yourself to counterevidence, the more your worldview will erode, replaced by a better, more accurate one -- it's just that you probably won't realize it until you look back at old posts on social media and cringe.<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<br />• Squarespace: www.squarespace.com/sosmart -- Offer code: SOSMART<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>145 - Team Human</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast we sit down with one of the original cyberpunks, the famed journalist, documentarian, media theorist, all-around technology superstar and weirdo, Douglas Rushkoff.<br /><br />MIT considers Rushkoff one of the &quot;world's ten most influential thinkers,&quot; and in the episode we talk about his latest (and 20th) book, Team Human. <br /><br />The book is a bit of a manifesto in which he imagines a new counterculture that would revolt against the algorithms that are slowly altering our collective behavior for the benefit of shareholders. Instead, he implores us, we should curate a digital, psychedelic substrate that embraces the messiness of human beings: our unpredictability, our pursuit of novelty and innovation, and our primate/animal/social connectedness.<br /><br />The book is presented in a series of aphorisms that add up to a rallying cry for building communities outside of what the machines that tend our walled gardens might suggest we build. As the title suggests, he would prefer that we turned our technological attention to encouraging and facilitating teamwork.<br /><br />In the book, he says that any technology whose initial purpose is to connect people will eventually become colonized and repurposed to repress and isolate them. But, the good news is that we’ve seen this pattern so often that we can now stop it in its tracks and choose to build something else. In the interview, you’ll hear what his thoughts are on all this -- and much more.<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: Free month at www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<br />• Squarespace: Use the offer code SOSMART at www.squarespace.com for 10 percent off your first purchase.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>144 - The Backfire Effect - Part Four (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, YANSS did three episodes about the backfire effect, and by far, those episodes were the most popular that year. Then, in 2018, part four was the most popular.<br /><br />The backfire effect has his special allure to it, because, on the surface, it seems to explain something we’ve all experienced -- when we argue with people who believe differently than us, who see the world through a different ideological lens -- they often resist our views, refuse to accept our way of seeing things, and it often seems like we do more harm than good, because they walk away seemingly more entrenched in their beliefs than before the argument began.<br /><br />But…since those first three shows, researchers have produced a series new studies into the backfire effect that complicate things. Yes, we are observing something here, and yes we are calling it the backfire effect, but everything is not exactly as it seems, and so I thought we should invite these new researchers on the show and add a fourth episode to the backfire effect series based on what they’ve found. And this is that episode (again).<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: Free month at www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<br />• Squarespace: Use the offer code SOSMART at www.squarespace.com for 10 percent off your first purchase.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>138 - Evil</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with psychologist Julia Shaw, an expert in memory and criminal psychology, to discuss her new book - Evil. In the book, she makes a case for something she calls &quot;evil empathy,&quot; seeing people who do heinous things as fellow human beings instead of as monsters. According to Shaw, othering criminals by categorizing them as a separate kind of human allows us to put them out of our minds and disappear them to institutions or prisons. The result is we become less-able to prevent the sort of behavior the harms others from happening again and again. In fact, she says &quot;there's no such thing as evil,&quot; and sees the term as an antiquated, magical label that dehumanizes others, preventing us from accumulating the sort of scientific evidence that could lead to a better society.<br /><br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />Sponsors:<br /><br />-- • The Great Courses: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart <br />-- • Squarespace: www.squarespace.com CODE: SOSMART<br />-- • One Fix: www.getonefix.com CODE: YANSS<br /><br />||| Show Notes at YouAreNotSoSmart.com |||<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>135 - Optimism Bias (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Tali Sharot, a cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist at University College London, explains our' innate optimism bias.<br /><br />When the brain estimates the outcome of future events, it tends to reduce the probability of negative outcomes for itself, but not so much for other people. In other words, if you are a smoker, everyone else is going to get cancer. The odds of success for a new restaurant change depending on who starts that venture, you or someone else. Sharot explains why and details how we can use our knowledge of this mental quirk to our advantage both personally and institutionally.<br /><br />More about Tali Sharot and her book The Optimism Bias here: theoptimismbias.blogspot.com/<br /><br />Sponsors:<br /><br />-- • The Great Courses: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart --<br />-- • Squarespace: www.squarespace.com CODE: SOSMART<br />-- • ZipRecruiter: www.ziprecruiter.com/notsosmart<br /><br />||| Show Notes at YouAreNotSoSmart.com |||<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we welcome Lilliana Mason on the program to discuss her new book, Uncivil Agreement, which focuses on the idea: “Our conflicts are over who we think we are, rather than reasoned differences of opinion.”<br /><br />Personally, I feel like this is just about the most important thing the social sciences are studying right now, and I think Mason is one of the its most brilliant scientists - I promise, the insights you are about to hear will change the way you think about politics, tweeting, elections, and arguing with people on the other side of just about everything.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>129 - Desirability Bias (rebroadcast)</title>

      <title>128 - Happy Brain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>What makes you happy? As in, what generates happiness inside the squishy bits that reside inside your skull? That's what author and neuroscientist Dean Burnett set out to answer in his new book, Happy Brain, which explores both the environmental and situational factors that lead to and away from happiness, and the neurological underpinnings of joy, bliss, comfort, love, and connection. In the episode you'll hear all that and more as we talk about what we know so far about the biological nature of happiness itself.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>124 - Belief Change Blindness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you changed your mind? Are you sure?<br /><br />In this episode we explore new research that suggests for the majority of the mind change we experience, after we update our priors, we delete what we used to believe and then simply forget that we ever thought otherwise.<br /><br />In the show, psychologists Michael Wolfe and Todd Williams, take us though their new research which suggests that because brains so value consistency, and are so determined to avoid the threat of decoherence, we hide the evidence of our belief change. That way, the story we tell ourselves about who we are can remain more or less heroic, with a stable, steadfast protagonist whose convictions rarely waver -- or, at least, they don’t waver as much as those of shifty, flip-flopping politicians.<br /><br />This can lead to a skewed perception of the world, one that leads to the assumption that mind change is rare and difficult-to-come-by. And that can lead to our avoiding information that might expand our understanding of the world, because we assume it will have no impact.<br /><br />The truth, say Wolfe and Williams, is that mind change is so prevalent and constant, that the more you expose yourself to counterevidence, the more your worldview will erode, replaced by a better, more accurate one -- it's just that you probably won't realize it until you look back at old posts on social media and cringe.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>123 - Active Information Avoidance (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Little did the champions of the Enlightenment know that once we had access to all the facts…well, reason and rationality wouldn’t just immediately wash across the land in a giant wave of enlightenment thinking. While that may be happening in some ways, the new media ecosystem has also unshackled some of our deepest psychological tendencies, things that enlightenment thinkers didn’t know about, weren’t worried about, or couldn’t have predicted. Many of which we’ve discussed in previous episodes like confirmation bias, selective skepticism, filter bubbles and so on. These things have always been with us, but modern technology has provided them with the perfect environment to flourish.<br /><br />In this episode, we explore another such invasive psychological species called active information avoidance, the act of keeping our senses away from information that might be useful, that we know is out there, that would cost us nothing to obtain, but that we’d still rather not learn. From choosing not to open open bills, visit the doctor, check your bank account, or read the nutrition information on the back of that box of Girl Scout Cookies, we each choose to remain ignorant when we’d rather not feel the anguish of illumination, but that same tendency can also cause great harm both to individuals and whole cultures when it spreads through politics, science, markets, and medicine. In this show, you’ll learn how.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>120 - The Backfire Effect - Part Four</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Last year on this show, we did three episodes about the backfire effect, and by far, those episodes were the most popular we’ve ever done.<br /><br />In fact, the famous web comic The Oatmeal turned them into a sort of special feature, and that comic of those episodes was shared on Facebook a gazillion times, which lead to a stories about the comic in popular media, and then more people listened to the shows, on and on it went. You can go see it at The Oatmeal right now at the top of their page. It’s titled, you are not going to believe what I am about to tell you.<br /><br />The popularity of the backfire effect extends into academia. The original paper has been cited hundreds of times, and there have been more than 300 articles written about it since it first came out.<br /><br />The backfire effect has his special allure to it, because, on the surface, it seems to explain something we’ve all experienced -- when we argue with people who believe differently than us, who see the world through a different ideological lens -- they often resist our views, refuse to accept our way of seeing things, and it often seems like we do more harm than good, because they walk away seemingly more entrenched in their beliefs than before the argument began.<br /><br />But…since those shows last year, researchers have produced a series new studies into the backfire effect that complicate things. Yes, we are observing something here, and yes we are calling it the backfire effect, but everything is not exactly as it seems, and so I thought we should invite these new researchers on the show and add a fourth episode to the backfire effect series based on what they’ve found. And this is that episode.<br /><br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: Free month at www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<br />• Squarespace: Use the offer code SOSMART at www.squarespace.com for 10 percent off your first purchase.<br />• BeachBody on Demand: Get a free trial membership, access to the entire platform, when you text SMART to 303030.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>119 - The Unpersuadables</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest for this episode, Will Storr, wrote a book called The Unpersuadables: Adventures with the Enemies of Science. <br /><br />In that book, Storr spends time with Holocaust deniers, young Earth creationists, people who believe they’ve lived past lives as famous figures, people who believe they’ve been abducted by aliens, people who stake their lives on the power of homeopathy, and many more – people who believe things that most of us do not. <br /><br />Storr explains in the book that after spending so much time with these people it started to become clear to him that it all goes back to that model of reality we all are forced to generate and then interact with. We are all forced to believe what that model tells us, and it is no different for people who are convinced that dinosaurs and human beings used to live together, or that you can be cured of an illness by an incantation delivered over the telephone. For some people, that lines up with their models of reality in a way that’s good enough. It’s a best guess.<br /><br />Storr proposes you try this thought experiment. First, answer this question: Are you right about everything you believe? Now, if you are like most people, the answer is no. Of course not. As he says, that would mean you are a godlike and perfect human being. You’ve been wrong enough times to know it can’t be true. You are wrong about some things, maybe many things. That leads to a second question – what are you are wrong about? Storr says when he asked himself this second question, he started listing all the things he believed and checked them off one at a time as being true, he couldn’t think of anything about which he was wrong.<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</p><p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p>

      <title>118 - Connections (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the YANSS Podcast, we sit down with legendary science historian James Burke.<br /><br />For much of his career, Burke has been creating documentaries and writing books aimed at helping us to make better sense of the enormous amount of information that he predicted would one day be at our fingertips.<br /><br />In Connections, he offered an “alternate view of history” in which great insights took place because of anomalies and mistakes, because people were pursuing one thing, but it lead somewhere surprising or was combined with some other object or idea they could never have imagined by themselves. Innovation took place in the spaces between disciplines, when people outside of intellectual and professional silos, unrestrained by categorical and linear views, synthesized the work of people still trapped in those institutions, who, because of those institutions, had no idea what each other was up to and therefore couldn’t predict the trajectory of even their own disciplines, much less history itself.<br /><br />In The Day the Universe Changed, Burke explored the sequential impact of discovery, innovation, and invention on how people defined reality itself. “You are what we know,” he wrote “and when the body of knowledge changes, so do we.” In this view of change, knowledge is invented as much as it is discovered, and new ideas “nibble at the edges” of common knowledge until values considered permanent and fixed fade into antiquity just like any other obsolete tool. Burke said that our system of knowledge and discovery has never been able, until recently, to handle more than one or two ways of seeing things at a time. In response we have long demanded conformity with the dominant worldview or with similarly homogenous ideological binaries.<br /><br />My favorite line from the book has to do with imagining a group of scientists who live in a society that believes the universe is made of omelettes and goes about designing instruments to detect traces of interstellar egg residue. When they observe evidence of galaxies and black holes, to them it all just seems like noise. Their model of nature cannot yet accommodate what they are seeing, so they don’t see it. “All that can accurately be said about a man who thinks he is a poached egg,” joked Burke, “is that he is in the minority.”<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: Free month at www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<br />• Squarespace: Use the offer code SOSMART at www.squarespace.com for 10 percent off your first purchase.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>105 - Optimism Bias</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Tali Sharot, a cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist at University College London, explains our' innate optimism bias. <br /><br />When the brain estimates the outcome of future events, it tends to reduce the probability of negative outcomes for itself, but not so much for other people. In other words, if you are a smoker, everyone else is going to get cancer. The odds of success for a new restaurant change depending on who starts that venture, you or someone else. Sharot explains why and details how we can use our knowledge of this mental quirk to our advantage both personally and institutionally.<br /><br />More about Tali Sharot and her book The Optimism Bias here: http://theoptimismbias.blogspot.com/<br /><br />Sponsors:<br /><br />-- • The Great Courses: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart --<br />-- • Dignity Health: www.dignityhealth.org/taketwomins --<br />-- • Blue Apron: www.blueapron.com/yanss --<br /><br />||| Show Notes at YouAreNotSoSmart.com |||<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is psychology too WEIRD? That's what this episode's guest, psychologist Steven J. Heine suggested when he and his colleagues published a paper suggesting that psychology wasn't the study of the human mind, but the study of one kind of human mind, the sort generated by the kinds of brains that happen to be conveniently located near the places where research is usually conducted - North American college undergraduates. They called them the WEIRDest people in the world, short for Western, Education, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic - the kind of people who make up less than 15 percent of the world's population. In this episode, you'll learn why it took so long to figure out it was studying outliers, and what it means for the future of psychology.<br /><br />- Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br />- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />SPONSORS<br /><br />• The Great Courses: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<br />• Squarespace: www.squarespace.com | Offer Code = sosmart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>082 - Crowds (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode’s guest, Michael Bond, is the author of The Power of Others, and reading his book I was surprised to learn that despite several decades of research into crowd psychology, the answers to most questions concerning crowds can still be traced back to a book printed in 1895.<br /><br />Gustave’s Le Bon’s book, “The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind,” explains that humans in large groups are dangerous, that people spontaneously de-evolve into subhuman beasts who are easily swayed and prone to violence. That viewpoint has informed the policies and tactics of governments and police forces for more than a century, and like many prescientific musings, much of it is wrong.<br /><br />Listen in this episode as Bond explains that the more research the social sciences conduct, the less the idea of a mindless, animalistic mob seems to be true. He also explains what police forces and governments should be doing instead of launching tear gas canisters from behind riot shields which actually creates the situation they are trying to prevent. Also, we touch on the psychology of suicide bombers, which is just as surprising as what he learned researching crowds.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Oddly enough, we don’t actually know very much about how to change people’s minds, not scientifically, that's why the work of the a group of LGBT activists in Los Angeles is offering something valuable to psychology and political science - uncharted scientific territory.<br /><br />The Leadership Lab has been developing a technique for the last eight years that can change a person’s mind about a contentious social issue after a 20-minute conversation.<br /><br />This episode is about that group's redemption after their reputation was threatened by a researcher who, in studying their persuasion technique, committed scientific fraud and forced the retraction of his paper.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Common sense used to dictate that men and women should only come together for breakfast and dinner. <br /><br />According to Victorian historian Kaythrn Hughes, people in the early 19th Century thought the outside world was dangerous and unclean and morally dubious and thus no place for a virtuous, fragile woman. The home was a paradise, while men went out into the world and got their hands dirty. <br /><br />By the mid 1800s, women were leaving home to work in factories and much more, and if you believed in preserving the separate spheres, the concept that men and women should only cross paths at breakfast and dinner, then as we approached the 20th century, this created a lot of anxiety for you.<br /><br />In this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast, we explore how the separate spheres ideology is still affecting us today, and how some people are using it to scare people into voting down anti-discrimination legislation.<br /><br />Show notes at: www.youarenotsosmart.com<br /><br />• Patreon: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />• Donate Directly through PayPal: www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney<br /><br />SPONSORS<br />• Blue Apron: www.blueapron.com/YANSS<br />• The Great Courses Plus: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>076 - The Genetic Fallacy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We often overestimate and overstate just how much we can learn about a claim based on where that claim originated, and that's the crux of the genetic fallacy, according to the experts in this episode.<br /><br />The genetic fallacy appears when people trace things back to their sources, and if you traced back to their shared source the ad hominem attack (insulting the source instead of attacking its argument) and the argument from authority (praising the source instead of supporting its argument), you would find the genetic fallacy is the mother of both kinds of faulty reasoning.<br /><br />You might be in danger of serially committing the genetic fallacy if your first instinct is to ask where attitude-inconsistent comes from once you feel the twinge of fear that appears after a belief is threatened.<br /><br />In this episode, listen as three experts in logic and rationality when we should and when we should not take the source of a statement into account when deciding if something is true or false.<br /><br />• Show Notes: http://bit.ly/1XCvCdr<br /><br />• Patreon: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart <br /><br />• Donate Directly through PayPal: www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney <br /><br />SPONSORS<br />• Bombas: Bombas.com/SOSMART<br />• Exo Protein: exoprotein.com/sosmart<br />• The Great Courses Plus: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We often overestimate and overstate just how much we can learn about a claim based on where that claim originated, and that's the crux of the genetic fallacy, according to the experts in this episode.<br /><br />The genetic fallacy appears when people trace things back to their sources, and if you traced back to their shared source the ad hominem attack (insulting the source instead of attacking its argument) and the argument from authority (praising the source instead of supporting its argument), you would find the genetic fallacy is the mother of both kinds of faulty reasoning.<br /><br />You might be in danger of serially committing the genetic fallacy if your first instinct is to ask where attitude-inconsistent comes from once you feel the twinge of fear that appears after a belief is threatened.<br /><br />In this episode, listen as three experts in logic and rationality when we should and when we should not take the source of a statement into account when deciding if something is true or false.<br /><br />• Show Notes: http://bit.ly/1XCvCdr<br /><br />• Patreon: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart <br /><br />• Donate Directly through PayPal: www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney <br /><br />SPONSORS<br />• Bombas: Bombas.com/SOSMART<br />• Exo Protein: exoprotein.com/sosmart<br />• The Great Courses Plus: www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we explore why we are unaware that we lack the skill to tell how unskilled and unaware we are. <br /><br />The evidence gathered so far by psychologists and neuroscientists seems to suggest that each one of us has a relationship with our own ignorance, a dishonest, complicated relationship, and that dishonesty keeps us sane, happy, and willing to get out of bed in the morning. Part of that ignorance is a blind spot we each possess that obscures both our competence and incompetence called the Dunning-Kruger Effect. <br /><br />It's a psychological phenomenon that arises sometimes in your life because you are generally very bad at self-assessment. If you have ever been confronted with the fact that you were in over your head, or that you had no idea what you were doing, or that you thought you were more skilled at something than you actually were – then you may have experienced this effect. It is very easy to be both unskilled and unaware of it, and in this episode we explore why that is with professor David Dunning, one of the researchers who coined the term and a scientist who continues to add to our understanding of the phenomenon.<br /><br />• Show Notes: http://bit.ly/1NfbAhf<br /><br />• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />• Donate Directly through PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney<br /><br />SPONSORS<br />• The Great Courses Plus: https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

Since you are born looking for those spots where chance events have built up like sand into dunes, picking out clusters of coincidence is a predicable malfunction of a normal human mind, and it can easily lead to the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.<br /><br />Listen as three experts in reasoning and logic explain why it is so easy to find what you are looking for when you go anomaly hunting in a large set of data.<br /><br />This episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast is the fifth in a full season of episodes exploring logical fallacies.

      <title>068 - The Strawman Fallacy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When confronted with dogma-threatening, worldview-menacing ideas, your knee-jerk response is usually to lash out and try to bat them away, but thanks to a nearly unavoidable mistake in reasoning, you often end up doing battle with arguments of your own creation.<br /><br />Your lazy brain is always trying to make sense of the world on ever-simpler terms. Just as you wouldn’t use a topographical map to navigate your way to Wendy’s, you tend to navigate reality using a sort of Google Maps interpretation of events and ideas. It’s less accurate, sure, but much easier to understand when details aren’t a priority. But thanks to this heuristical habit, you sometimes create mental men of straw that stand in for the propositions put forth by people who see the world a bit differently than you. In addition to being easy to grasp, they are easy to knock down and hack apart, which wouldn’t be a problem if only you noticed the switcheroo.<br /><br />This is the essence of the straw man fallacy, probably the most common of all logical fallacies. Setting up and knocking down straw men is so easy to do while arguing that you might not even notice that you are doing it.<br /><br />In this episode, you’ll learn from three experts in logic and arguing why human brains tend not to realize they are constructing artificial versions of the arguments they wish to defeat. Once you’ve wrapped your mind around that idea, you’ll then learn how to spot the straw man fallacy, how to avoid committing it, and how to defend against it.<br /><br />• Show Notes: http://bit.ly/1VN5PPP<br /><br />• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart<br /><br />• Donate Directly through PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney<br /><br />SPONSORS<br />• Trunk Club: http://bit.ly/1Sp2wZj<br />• The Great Courses Plus: http://bit.ly/26kDXpU<br />• SquareSpace: http://www.squarespace.com - Offer Code SoSmart<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The problem with sorting out failures and successes is that failures are often muted, destroyed, or somehow removed from sight while successes are left behind, weighting your decisions and perceptions, tilting your view of the world. <br /><br />That means to be successful you must learn how to seek out what is missing.

      <title>064 - Monkey Marketplace - Laurie Santos (rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest in this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast is psychologist Laurie Santos who heads the Comparative Cognition Laboratory at Yale University. In that lab, she and her colleagues are exploring the fact that when two species share a relative on the evolutionary family tree, not only do they share similar physical features, but they also share similar behaviors. Psychologists and other scientists have used animals to study humans for a very long time, but Santos and her colleagues have taken it a step further by choosing to focus on a closer relation, the capuchin monkey; that way they could investigate subtler, more complex aspects of human decision making – like cognitive biases.<br /><br />One of her most fascinating lines of research has come from training monkeys how to use money. That by itself is worthy of a jaw drop or two. Yes, monkeys can be taught how to trade tokens for food, and for years, Santos has observed capuchin monkeys attempting to solve the same sort of financial problems humans have attempted in prior experiments, and what Santos and others have discovered is pretty amazing. Monkeys and humans seem to be prone to the same biases, and when it comes to money, they make the same kinds of mistakes.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>063 - The Search Effect - Matthew Fisher</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>What effect does Google have on your brain? Here's an even weirder question: what effect does knowing that you have access to Google have on your brain?<br /><br />In this episode we explore what happens when a human mind becomes aware that it can instantly, on-command, at any time, search for the answer to any question, and then, most of time, find it.<br /><br />According to researcher Matthew Fisher, one of the strange side effects is an inflated sense of internal knowledge. In other words, as we use search engines, over time we grow to mistakenly believe we know more than we actually do even when we no longer have access to the internet.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What effect does Google have on your brain? Here's an even weirder question: what effect does knowing that you have access to Google have on your brain?<br /><br />In this episode we explore what happens when a human mind becomes aware that it can instantly, on-command, at any time, search for the answer to any question, and then, most of time, find it.<br /><br />According to researcher Matthew Fisher, one of the strange side effects is an inflated sense of internal knowledge. In other words, as we use search engines, over time we grow to mistakenly believe we know more than we actually do even when we no longer have access to the internet.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>062 - Naive Realism - Lee Ross</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In psychology, they call it naive realism, the tendency to believe that the other side is wrong simply because they are misinformed.<br /><br />According to Lee Ross, co-author of the new book, The Wisest One in the Room, naive realism has three tenets. One, you tend to believe that you arrived at your political opinions after careful, rational analysis through unmediated thoughts and perceptions. Two, since you are extremely careful and devoted to sticking to the facts and thus free from bias and impervious to persuasion, anyone else who has read the things you have read or seen the things you have seen will naturally see things your way, given that they’ve pondered the matter as thoughtfully as you have. And three, if anyone does disagree with your political opinions it must be because they simply don’t have all the facts yet.<br /><br />Since this is the default position most humans take when processing a political opinion, when confronted with people who disagree, you tend to assume there must be a rational explanation. Usually, that explanation is that the other side is either lazy or stupid or corrupted by some nefarious information-scrambling entity like cable news, a blowhard pundit, a charming pastor or a lack thereof.<br /><br /><br />Ross and Ward concluded that naive realism leads people to approach political arguments with the confidence that “rational open-minded discourse” will naturally lead to a rapid narrowing of disagreement, but that confidence usually short lived. Instead, they say our “repeated attempts at dialogue with those on the ‘other side’ of a contentious issue make us aware that they rarely yield to our attempts at enlightenment; nor do they yield to the efforts of articulate, fair-minded spokespersons who share our views.” In other words, it’s naive to think evidence presented from the sources you trust will sway your opponents because when they do the same, it never sways you.<br /><br />Listen in this episode as legendary psychologist Lee Ross explains how to identify, avoid, and combat this most pernicious of cognitive mistakes.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>061 - Mindfulness - Michael Taft</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You have the power to wield neuroplasticity to your advantage.<br /><br />Just as you can change your body at the atomic level by lifting weights, you can willfully alter your brain by...thinking in a certain way. In this episode we explore using your brain to change your brain at the level of neurons and synapses beyond what is possible through other methods like learning a new language or earning a degree in chemistry. With mindfulness meditation, the evidence seems to suggest that one can achieve a level of change that would be impossible otherwise. The more you attempt to focus, the better you get at focusing on command, and so a real change begins taking place - you slowly become able to think differently, to hold thoughts differently and to dismiss thoughts that before led to attention difficulties or what feels like unwanted thoughts or clutter - and that’s not magical or the result of shaking hands with a deity, it’s biological. Listen as author and meditation teacher Michael Taft explains the benefits of secular, scientific practice of modern mindfulness meditation<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>060 - Reframing - Robert R. Morris</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Reframing is one of those psychological tools that just plain works. It’s practical, simple, and with practice and repetition it often leads to real change in people with a variety of thinking problems.<br /><br />It works because we rarely question our own interpretations, the meanings we construct when examining a set of facts, or our own introspections of internal emotional states. So much of the things the anxiety and fear we feel when anticipating the future is just the result of plucking from a grab bag of best guesses and assumptions, shaky models of reality that may or may not be accurate and will likely pan out much differently than we predict. <br /><br />In this episode, we meet Tom Bunn, a former commercial pilot who uses reframing to cure people of their fears of flying and Robert Morris, a startup CEO who is developing a social network to crowdsource mental health in which users reframe others people's fears and anxious thoughts and in the process learn to reframe their own fruitless cognitive loops in their daily lives. <br /><br />After the interview, I discuss a news story about how humanizing slot machines can encourage people to empty their pockets at casinos.<br /><br />In every episode, after I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader. That listener/reader wins a signed copy of my new book, “You Are Now Less Dumb,” and I post the recipe on the YANSS Pinterest page. This episode’s winner is Marion Low who submitted a recipe for Hertzoggies.

      <title>059 - The Illusion Of Control - Michael And Sarah Bennett</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the show, you'll hear Michael elaborate on why that is. In this episode, our guests are Harvard-trained psychiatrist Michael I. Bennett and his comedy writer daughter Sarah Bennett whose new book, Fuck Feelings, makes the case for accepting the illusion of control as a guiding principle for living a better life.<br /><br />Time and again, study after study, psychologists have found that in situations in which the outcomes are clearly, undoubtable random or otherwise outside the realm of control, people tend to latch onto any shred of evidence that could be interpreted otherwise. It's a habit that can lead to self-loathing, ineffectual strategies for change, and lives filled with missed opportunities and squandered productivity.<br /><br />As the Bennetts explain in the book, most people seek a therapist in an effort to actively deny that they don't have any control over their emotions. Stuck in a neurotic, fruitless loop, people begin to wonder why they can't achieve perpetual happiness or erase their proclivity to procrastinate. If they could just fix the things they see as broken, they could then become the people they've always wanted to be and finally begin their lives.<br /><br />But just how much control do you really have over your feelings or your essential nature? According to the Bennetts, much less than you would like to believe. Your efforts are better spent elsewhere.<br /><br />In this episode, listen as Michael and Sarah explain what you should be doing instead, and why they say - &quot;Fuck feelings.&quot;<br /><br />After the interview, I discuss a news story about how people can be fooled into believing a meal is delicious when told a master chef cooked the meal.<br /><br />In every episode, after I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader. That listener/reader wins a signed copy of my new book, “You Are Now Less Dumb,” and I post the recipe on the YANSS Pinterest page.

      <title>055 - WEIRD People - Steven J. Heine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is psychology too WEIRD? That's what this episode's guest, psychologist Steven J. Heine suggested when he and his colleagues published a paper suggesting that psychology wasn't the study of the human mind, but the study of one kind of human mind, the sort generated by the kinds of brains that happen to be conveniently located near the places where research is usually conducted - North American college undergraduates. They called them the WEIRDest people in the world, short for Western, Education, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic - the kind of people who make up less than 15 percent of the world's population. In this episode, you'll learn why it took so long to figure out it was studying outliers, and what it means for the future of psychology.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is the person you believe to be the protagonist of your life story real or a fictional character? In other words, is your very self real or is it an illusion? According to psychologist Bruce Hood, the person at the center of your life isn't really there; it's all neurological smoke and mirrors. Sure, you have the sensation that you have a self, and that sensation is real, but the beliefs and ideas that spring from it are not.

In this episode we interview Lazlo Bock, head of People Operations at Google, who helped his company make work suck less, way less, by introducing new policies and procedures based on knowledge gained by psychology and neuroscience concerning biases, fallacies, and other weird human behavior quirks. In addition, Google has advanced our knowledge of such phenomena by conducting its own internal experiments and collecting mountains of data. The result has been a workplace where people are happier, more productive, and better able to pursue that which fulfills their ambitions.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Can you change a person's mind on a divisive social issue? The latest science says...yes. But it will require two things: contact and disclosure. In this episode you'll travel to Mississippi to see how professional mind changers are working to shift attitudes on LGBT rights, and you'll learn how a man in Los Angeles conducted 12,000 conversations until he was able to perfect the most powerful version of contact possible. In one 22-minute chat, Dave Fleischer can change people's minds on issues they've felt strongly about for decades, and change them forever.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>047 - Public Shaming - Jon Ronson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Public shaming is back. Once done in town squares, the subjects of our ridicule locked in pillories and unable to avoid the rotten fruit and insults we hurled at them, now the shaming takes place on the internet. No longer our neighbors, the new targets are strangers and celebrities, and instead of courts meting out justice, it is the aggregate outrage of well-meaning people on Twitter just like you. Listen as author Jon Ronson describes his new book, “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed,” in which he spends time with people who have had their lives ruined by modern, web-based public shamings in an attempt to reveal to each of us what can happen when, alone but together, we obliterate people for unpopular opinions, off-color jokes, offensive language, and professional faux pas.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>040 - Monkey Marketplace - Laurie Santos</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How far back can we trace our irrational behaviors and cognitive biases? Evolutionarily speaking, why do we even do these things? Can we blame our faulty logic on our cultures and institutions, or should we blame it on our biology and our genetic inheritance? Our guest on this episode is psychologist Laurie Santos who has created a novel approach to solving these questions - a marketplace where monkeys learn how to use money just like humans, and where they tend to make the same kind of mistakes as well.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>033 - Belief - Will Storr</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you think that everything you believe is true? If not, then what are you wrong about? It is a difficult question to answer, and it leads to many others. Where do our beliefs come from, and how do we know where we should place our doubt? Why don't facts seem to work on people? In this episode we explore the psychology of belief through interviews with Margaret Maitland, an Egyptologist, Jim Alcock, a psychologist who studies belief, and Will Storr, a journalist who wrote about his adventures with people who believe in things most people don't in his book, The Unpersuadables.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

In this episode we explore the psychology of belief through interviews with Margaret Maitland, an Egyptologist, Jim Alcock, a psychologist who studies belief, and Will Storr, a journalist who wrote about his adventures with people who believe in things most people don't in his book, The Unpersuadables.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>031 - Extinction Burst</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Why do you so often fail at removing bad habits from your life?<br /><br />You try to diet, to exercise, to stop smoking, to stop staying up until 2 a.m. stuck in a hamster wheel of internet diversions, and right when you seem to be doing well, right when it seems like your bad habit is dead, you lose control. It seems all too easy for one transgression, one tiny cheating bite of pizza or puff of smoke, and then it's all over. You binge, calm down, and the habit returns, reanimated and stronger than ever. <br /><br />You ask yourself, how is it possible I can be so good at so many things, so clever in so many ways, and still fail at outsmarting my own vice-ridden brain? The answer has to do with conditioning, classical like Pavlov and operant like Skinner, and a psychological phenomenon that's waiting in the future for every person who tries to twist shut the spigot of reward and pleasure - the extinction burst, and in this episode we explore how it works, why it happens, and how you can overcome it.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I did something this week that I’m sure many people secretly do every day. I stopped, talked to myself for a moment, and checked to see how much slack was in the leash I keep on my tongue.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />I was reminded that I need to do that from time to time, or at least I believe that I do, by a bit of news that was passed around for a few days this week. The reports said that one of the government’s most prestigious energy laboratories was working to eradicate the Southern accent – not from the planet, mind you, just from employees who had requested the service.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />The Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a place where Nobel laureates hang out. It’s a place where thousands of scientists work daily trying to solve some of the world’s most serious problems. It has, according to the website, a $1.46 billion annual budget. This week, NPR reported that the Tennessee laboratory swiftly canceled its plans to hold a six-week course aimed at reducing the Southern drawl among employees. They explained to reporters that the course was created at the request of employees, not the lab, and that it was also shot down by other employees who found the idea offensive.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />I learned through this reporting that there are professional twang assassins who go around to businesses and large organizations like this one helping people neutralize and flatten their native lilts and inflections. Not just the Southern accent either, if your organization is chugging along thanks to regional dialects weighted down with negative associations, professionals can help rid you of that baggage.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />I have to admit, it bothers me that brilliant scientists would be self-conscious about droppin’ the letter g, and leaving behind a trail of y’alls during lectures about spallation neutron sources and high flux isotope reactors. But, I get it. I feel for them. If I hadn’t spent so much time over the years working to flatten out my own Southern accent, and if I knew what a high flux isotope reactor was, I might consider taking that course.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />I don’t hate the Southern accent. I’m not ashamed of it. I share my motivations with Stephen Colbert who explained why he flattened out his tongue back in 2006 in an interview with 60 Minutes. When Morley Safer asked him why he didn’t sound like other people from South Carolina, Colbert said, “At a very young age, I decided I was not going have a southern accent. When I was a kid watching TV, if you wanted to use a shorthand that someone was stupid, you gave the character a Southern accent. Now that’s not true. Southern people aren’t stupid, but I didn’t want to seem stupid. I wanted to seem smart.”<br />
<br /><br />
<br />I want to seem smart too, or, at least, not dumb. That’s why I hide my accent and occasionally reel it back in when I notice it’s getting too frisky. The Southern accent tells people you are from the South, and being from the South labels you with an assortment of negative associations, and the associative architecture of memory causes people to involuntarily, unconsciously, invisibly change they way they think, feel, and behave once such a label worms its way into the brain.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Consider these two phenomena – the Baker/baker paradox and the halo effect. The Baker/baker paradox describes how subjects in studies tend find it very difficult to remember last names like Farmer or Baker but find it very easy to remember that each person was a baker or a farmer. The last names are part of weak networks with few nodes while the professions are part of vast networks with constellations of nodes connected to ideas all over the mind. How many Farmers can you name? How many items can you name that you might find on a farm? The stronger the network, the easier it is to think about something, to remember it, and to feel whatever your culture and upbringing has primed you to feel about it. That’s why the halo effect is so powerful.

      <title>028 - Crowds - Michael Bond</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It is a human tendency that’s impossible not to notice during wars and revolutions – and a dangerous one to forget when resting between them.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In psychology they call it deindividuation, losing yourself to the will of a crowd. In a mob, protest, riot, or even an audience, the presence of others redraws the borders of your normal persona. Simply put, you will think, feel and do things in a crowd that alone you would not.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Psychology didn’t discover this, of course. The fact that being in a group recasts the character you usually play has been the subject of much reflection ever since people have had the time to reflect. No, today psychology is trying to chip away at the prevailing wisdom on what crowds do to your mind and why.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />This episode’s guest, Michael Bond, is the author of The Power of Others, and reading his book I was surprised to learn that despite several decades of research into crowd psychology, the answers to most questions concerning crowds can still be traced back to a book printed in 1895.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Gustave’s Le Bon’s book, “The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind,” explains that humans in large groups are dangerous, that people spontaneously de-evolve into subhuman beasts who are easily swayed and prone to violence. That viewpoint has informed the policies and tactics of governments and police forces for more than a century, and like many prescientific musings, much of it is wrong.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Listen in this episode as Bond explains that the more research the social sciences conduct, the less the idea of a mindless, animalistic mob seems to be true. He also explains what police forces and governments should be doing instead of launching tear gas canisters from behind riot shields, which as he explains, actually creates the situation they are trying to prevent. Also, we touch on the psychology of suicide bombers, which is just as surprising as what he learned researching crowds.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview, I discuss new research into how hiring quotas work and don’t work in loose societies vs. tight societies.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In every episode, before I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader. That listener/reader wins a signed copy of my book, and I post the recipe on the YANSS Pinterest page. This episode’s winner is Laura Lee Gooding who submitted a recipe for stained-glass window cookies.

      <title>027 - Science Communication - Joe Hanson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently collaborated with Joe Hanson of the YouTube channel It’s Okay to be Smart and helped him write an episode about pattern recognition. I thought it would be great to bring him on the show and interview him in an episode all about the new science communicators.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />We learn what it is like to be part of the new wave of science communication, talk about science literacy, and discuss the ramifications of rubbing a beard with an infected chicken before conducting lab work.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview, I discuss a study about the difference between dogma and belief superiority, and how it helps explain why some politicians will never compromise.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>026 - Maslow&apos;s Hammer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” You’ve heard the expression before. You’ve may have, like myself, smugly used it a few times to feel like you made an intelligent point in an office conversation. It’s one of those great comebacks that we’ve decided is ok to use in professional settings like congressional debates and televised political arguments about everything from gun control to foreign policy. But, it might surprise you to learn who wrote it, how young the above quote is, and why it was written in the first place.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Why do we sleep and why do we dream? Despite the fact that every human being spends roughly 1/3 of his or her life asleep, science has yet to crack the mystery of the phenomenon. Why do we sleep and dream? The answer for now is...we don't know. To learn more, we interview psychologist Richard Wiseman who has written a new book on sleep and dreaming that promises to help you get the most out of both based on what science has learned so far.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>023 - Inbetweenisode 4 - The Illusion of Asymmetric Insight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the 1950s, in an effort to better understand group conflict, a team of psychologists nearly turned a summer camp into Lord of The Flies.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />The story of how and why it was so easy to turn normal boys into bloodthirsty, warring tribes (and how those tribes eventually reconciled and became peaceful) can teach you a lot about a common mental phenomenon known as the illusion of asymmetric insight - something that helps keep you loyal to certain groups and alters the way you see outsiders.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Later experiments revealed that if you imagine people's inner lives as icebergs  with some things showing above the surface and some things hidden from view, that you have a tendency to believe most of your iceberg is hidden, while everyone else's is mostly visible. Scaled up, you also believe this about the groups to which you belong - yours are nuanced and complicated, theirs are simple and transparent (and dumb).<br />
<br /><br />
<br />This asymmetry of insight colors your interactions and decisions big and small. That's what we explore in this inbetweenisode of the YANSS Podcast.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>022 - Survivorship Bias - Megan Price</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The problem with sorting out failures and successes is that failures are often muted, destroyed, or somehow removed from view while successes are left behind, weighting your decisions and perceptions, tilting your view of the world. That means to be successful you must learn how to seek out what is missing. You must learn what not to do. Unfortunately, survivorship bias stands between you and the epiphanies you seek.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />To learn how to combat this pernicious bias, we explore the story of Abraham Wald and the Department of War Math founded during World War II, and then we interview Wald's modern-day counterpart, Megan Price, statistician and director of research at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group who explains how she uses math and statistics to save lives and improve conditions in areas of the world suffering from the effects of war.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>020 - The Future - James Burke and Matt Novak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you love educational entertainment – programs about science, nature, history, technology and everything in between – it is a safe bet that the creators of those shows were heavily influenced by the founding fathers of science communication: Carl Sagan, David Attenborough, and James Burke.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast we sit down with James Burke and discuss the past, the present, and where he sees us heading in the future. Burke says we must soon learn how to deal with a world in which scarcity is scarce, abundance is abundant, and home manufacturing can produce just about anything you desire.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />James Burke is a legendary science historian who created the landmark BBC series Connections which provided an alternative view of history and change by replacing the traditional “Great Man” timeline with an interconnected web in which all people influence one another to blindly direct the flow of progress. Burke is currently writing a new book about the coming age of abundance, and he continues to work on his Knowledge Web project.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />We also sit down with Matt Novak, creator and curator of Paleofuture, a blog that explores retro futurism, sifting through the many ways people in the past predicted how the future would turn out, sometimes correctly, mostly not.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Together, Burke and Novak help us understand why we are to terrible at predicting the future and what we can learn about how history truly unfolds so we can better imagine who we will be in the decades to come.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview, I discuss a news story about how cigarettes affect the way your brain interprets cigarette advertising.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>019 - The Placebo Effect - Kristi Erdal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How powerful is the placebo effect? After a good night’s sleep could a scientist convince you that you had tossed and turned, and if so, how would that affect your perceptions and behavior? What if a doctor told you that you had slept like a baby when in reality you had barely slept at all? Would hearing those words improve your performance on a difficult test?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In this episode we learn the answers to these questions and more as we explore how research continues to unravel the mysteries behind the placebo effect and how it can drastically alter our bodies and minds.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Our guest is Kristi Erdal, a psychologist at Colorado College who discovered placebo sleep along with one of her students, Christina Draganich. Draganich wondered if such a thing might exist after reading all the literature on placebos, and Erdal helped her create the research methods she used to test her hypothesis.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>014 - Narratives - Melanie C. Green</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we discuss the power of narratives to affect our beliefs and behaviors with Melanie C. Green, a psychologist who studies the persuasive power of fiction.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />According to Nielsen, the TV ratings company, the average person in the United States watches about 34 hours of television a week. That’s 73 days a year. Over the course of a lifetime, the average American can expect to spend a full decade lost in the trance spell that only powerful narratives can cast over the human mind.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />What is the power of all the stories we consume through television? What about movies and books and comics and video games and everything else? How does it affect our beliefs and behaviors?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />We discuss all of that and more with Melanie C. Green who is a social psychologist who developed the transportation into a narrative worlds theory that helps explain total story immersion and how it translates into influence over our real-world behaviors. Green is an assistant professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. You can find her on Twitter using the handle @NarrProf or her website.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview I eat some chocolate orange cherry cookies sent in by Elliot Jones and then discuss how photographs can either enhance or dampen your memory depending on how you use them.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>

      <title>013 - Technology - Clive Thompson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The very fact that you are reading this sentence, contemplating whether you want to listen to this podcast, means that you are living out a fantasy from a previous generation's cyberpunk novel.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />However you made it here, however you got these words into your brain, you did so by diving through data streams first cooked up by delirious engineers downing late-night coffees, wandering deep within rows of data tape unspooling from jerky, spinning platters.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />We've been dreaming of this life for a long time, since before the vacuum tubes and punchcards of the '40s, and now that we are here, some people are worried that the tech will, at best, make us lazy, and at worst make us stupid.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Is all this new technology improving our thinking or dampening it? Are all these new communication tools turning us into navel-gazing human/brand hybrids, or are we developing a new set of senses that allow us to benefit from never severing contact with the people most important to us?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />That's the topic of this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast, and to answer these questions we welcome this episode's guest, Clive Thompson, who is the author of Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better. As the title suggests, he disagrees with the naysayers, and his book is an impressive investigation into why they are probably (thankfully) wrong. Thompson is a journalist whose work can be found published in Wired, The Washington Post, and the New York Times Magazine. You can learn more about him at his website, CollisionDetection.Net.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview, I discuss a news story about research into how the way you walk can encourage or discourage criminals to attack you.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In every episode, before I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader. That listener/reader wins a signed copy of my new book, “You Are Now Less Dumb,” and I post the recipe on the YANSS Pinterest page. This episode’s winner is Joye Swan who submitted a recipe for chewy rosemary sugar cookies.

<br />We've been dreaming of this life for a long time, since before the vacuum tubes and punchcards of the '40s, and now that we are here, some people are worried that the tech will, at best, make us lazy, and at worst make us stupid.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Is all this new technology improving our thinking or dampening it? Are all these new communication tools turning us into navel-gazing human/brand hybrids, or are we developing a new set of senses that allow us to benefit from never severing contact with the people most important to us?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />That's the topic of this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast, and to answer these questions we welcome this episode's guest, Clive Thompson, who is the author of Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better. As the title suggests, he disagrees with the naysayers, and his book is an impressive investigation into why they are probably (thankfully) wrong. Thompson is a journalist whose work can be found published in Wired, The Washington Post, and the New York Times Magazine. You can learn more about him at his website, CollisionDetection.Net.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview, I discuss a news story about research into how the way you walk can encourage or discourage criminals to attack you.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In every episode, before I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader. That listener/reader wins a signed copy of my new book, “You Are Now Less Dumb,” and I post the recipe on the YANSS Pinterest page. This episode’s winner is Joye Swan who submitted a recipe for chewy rosemary sugar cookies.

      <title>012 - Jealousy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Why do human beings experience jealousy, what is its function, and what are the warning signs that signal this powerful emotion may lead to violence?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Once reserved for the contemplation of poets and playwrights, jealousy is now the subject of intense scientific scrutiny. &quot;Mate poachers abound,&quot; explains this week's guest, psychologist David Buss, who says that his research supports his hypothesis that human jealousy is an adaptation forged by evolutionary forces to deal with the problems of infidelity. Moderate jealousy, he says, is healthy and signals commitment, but there is a dark and corrosive side as well that follows a clear, predictable pattern before it destroys lives.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />David Buss is a professor of psychology who studies human mating at The University of Texas at Austin. He his the author of The Evolution Of Desire: Strategies Of Human Mating, Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is As Necessary As Love and Sex, The Murderer Next Door: Why the Mind Is Designed to Kill, and Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge. You can learn more about him and his work at DavidBuss.com.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview I discuss a news story about research into societies in which women are more competitive than men.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />In every episode, before I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader. That listener/reader wins a signed copy of my new book, “You Are Now Less Dumb,” and I post the recipe on the YANSS Pinterest page.

      <title>011 - Culture</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is your state of mind from one situation to the next drastically altered by the state in which you live? According to cultural psychologists, yes it is.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Studies show that your thoughts, perceptions, emotions, and behaviors in response to a particular setting will reliably differ from those of others in that same setting depending on where you spent your childhood or even where you spent six years or more of your adult life.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />On this episode of the You Are Not So Smart podcast, we explore cultural cognition and the psychological effects of the region you call home on the brain you call yours.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />My guest this week:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Hazel Rose Markus is a social psychologist at Stanford University who studies the effects of culture, class, ethnicity, region, society, and gender on the concept of self and human psychology in general. She is the author of Clash! Eight Cultural Conflicts that Make Us Who We Are (Link: http://www.amazon.com/Clash-Cultural-Conflicts-That-Make/dp/1594630984). You can learn more about her at her website here (Link: http://www.stanford.edu/~hazelm/cgi-bin/wordpress/).<br />
<br /><br />
<br />After the interview I try out a cinnamon chocolate cookie and read a bit of psychology news about how reading good books can make you more adept at reading faces.<p><a href="http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart">Patreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart</a></p></p>
