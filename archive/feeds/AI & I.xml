    <description>Learn how the smartest people in the world are using AI to think, create, and relate. Each week I interview founders, filmmakers, writers, investors, and others about how they use AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney in their work and in their lives. We screen-share through their historical chats and then experiment with AI live on the show. Join us to discover how AI is changing how we think about our world—and ourselves.

        <![CDATA[<p>I interviewed Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott about the future of agents and software engineering for another special edition of <em>AI &amp; I</em>. </p><p><br></p><p>With 41 years of programming behind him, Kevin has lived through nearly every big shift in modern software development. Here’s his clear-eyed take on what’s changing with AI, and how we can navigate what’s next:</p><ul><li><strong>The real breakthrough for the agentic web is better plumbing. </strong>Kevin thinks agents won’t be useful until they can take action on your behalf by using tools and fetching data. To do this, agents need access across your systems—and Microsoft’s answer is adopting Model Context Protocol, or “MCP,” that allows an agent to access tools and fresh data beyond its knowledge base, as their standard protocol for agents to move through contexts and get things done.</li><li><strong>How the agentic web echoes the early internet. </strong>Just as protocols like HTTP and HTML gave the web a shared language, Kevin believes the  agentic web needs its own infrastructure—the first glimpses of this include MCP (the HTTP of agents) and NLWeb, Microsoft’s push to make websites legible to agents (similar to what HTML did for browsers).</li><li><strong>Open ecosystems can coexist with strong security systems. </strong>Kevin argues that the “tradeoff” between ecosystems that allow “permissionless” innovation and robust security is a false dichotomy. With AI agents that understand your personal risk preferences—and know your communication habits across email, text, and other channels—they could detect when something suspicious is happening and act on your behalf. </li><li><strong>The craftsman’s dilemma in the age of agents. </strong>Kevin is a lifelong maker—of software, ceramics, even handmade bags—and he cares deeply about how things are made. Because this can feel at odds with coding with AI agents, Kevin’s approach is to notice where the process matters most to him, and where it's okay to optimize for outcomes. After four decades of seeing breakthrough technologies, his advice is simple: be curious, try stuff, and use it if it works for you.</li><li><strong>The future of software engineering agents is plural. </strong>Kevin believes the future of software engineering agents will be diverse because developers who enjoy the freedom of playing with different tools is one of the most consistent patterns he’s seen in his decades in tech. What will drive this diversity, he says, is builders who deeply understand specific problems and tailor agents to solve them exceptionally well.</li><li><strong>How agentic workflows will evolve. </strong>Kevin sees a shift from short back-and-forth interactions with agents to longer, async feedback loops.

        <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI just launched Codex, a brand-new coding agent that can build features and fix bugs autonomously. We’ve been testing it at Every for a few days, and I’m impressed.</p><p>I invited Alexander Embiricos, a member of the OpenAI product staff responsible for Codex, to demo the agent live on a special edition of AI &amp; I. We talk through:</p><p>- What Codex is and how it works. Codex’s UI allows developers to see the list of tasks the agent is working on, how many lines were changed for each, and the status of the PR. It’s built for the senior software engineer who wants to delegate and review tasks efficiently.<br>- How OpenAI is thinking about agents. Codex is one piece of a unified super-assistant OpenAI wants to eventually build—an agent that helps users easily get things done by selecting the right tools for them behind the scenes. <br>- Why an “abundance mindset” is best for interacting with agents. Codex is designed to allow users to delegate many tasks at once without getting caught up in the details. This lets you point an abundance of agents at a specific task, like a difficult bug—it’s worth it even if only one of them succeeds.<br>- OpenAI’s vision for the future of programming. In the future developers will probably spend less time writing routine code and more time guiding agents, reviewing their work, and making strategy decisions. Programming will become more social, letting teams easily delegate multiple tasks at once, allowing people to focus on ideas and collaboration instead of routine coding.</p><p>Timestamps:</p><ol><li>Introduction: 00:00:52</li><li>The product decisions behind Codex’s interface: 00:01:40</li><li>How Codex works under the hood: 00:06:20</li><li>Why you need an abundance mindset to work well with agents: 00:14:06</li><li>Setting Codex to work on a real task in “Ask” mode: 00:16:28</li><li>How OpenAI is thinking about designing agents: 00:18:54</li><li>The future of programming is social: 00:31:16</li><li>Reviewing Codex’s work live: 00:37:21</li><li>How the landscape of agents will evolve: 00:39:41</li></ol>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Will England just pivoted his $10B AUM hedge fund to go all in on AI with a firm-wide email: “I wrote this email using ChatGPT—you should too. As a hedge fund, we should be ashamed to leave money on the table by ignoring AI.”</p><p>It’s working: 75% of his 400-person team are using ChatGPT daily—and Walleye is well on its way to transforming into an AI-first juggernaut. They record every meeting, use LLMs to ingest and analyze earnings reports, and are building “The Borg”—a firmwide intelligence layer.</p><p>What’s surprising? Will isn’t some AI hype man: He’s the CEO, CIO, and managing partner of Walleye Capital, a multi-strategy hedge fund competing with firms like Citadel, Millenium, and Point72. He’s Princeton and Oxford educated, but he’s based in Minnesota, doesn’t have an X account, and rarely gives interviews.</p><p>In my experience, teams go as their CEO goes—and Will is the best example of a CEO going all in on AI that I’ve seen. "It would be irresponsible not to go after AI with maximum discipline and intensity," Will told me—and in this episode he lays out his exact playbook for doing it.</p><p>We get into:</p><ul><li><strong>Why AI is essential operating leverage. </strong>At Walleye, using AI is treated like using email or Excel. Ignoring it means getting left behind—in an industry where information = money, every edge counts. England makes this not optional for anyone, backed by internal leaderboards and cash incentives.</li><li><strong>How Will uses AI for journaling and decision-making</strong>. Will journals every day using ChatGPT, which helps him with everything from decision-making at work to reflecting on his family life to tracking his workouts. </li><li><strong>How Will pivoted his billion dollar firm. </strong>Will’s commitment to AI isn’t theoretical—he announced AI as the new standard for work at Walleye, and made avoiding it unacceptable. </li><li><strong>How to lead during times of technological change.</strong> Will leads with an ethic of personal responsibility: "If we get disrupted by AI, that's on me.”</li><li><strong>Why students of history do better at handling the future. </strong>Will sees today like the 1860s–1910s era—when the Industrial Revolution introduced factories and railroads and the skills and roles needed inside of companies transformed quickly.</li><li><strong>How Will uses AI to write faster. </strong>Will uses ChatGPT to help him draft emails or memos that would have taken hours in 15 minutes. He bullets out of his thoughts and then uses LLMs to turn that into polished prose. Having AI handle the linguistic syntax gives him more time for conceptual thinking.</li></ul><p>This is a must-watch for anyone who wants to lead a team through change with clarity and conviction.  </p><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p><p>Attio: Go to<a href="http://attio.com/lenny">⁠⁠⁠⁠ https://www.⁠⁠⁠⁠attio.com/every⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</a> and get 15% off your first year on your AI-powered CRM.</p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">⁠https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt⁠</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p>After two Jhana meditation retreats Nadia Asparouhova could silence her mind, change her emotional state at will, and even intentionally slip out of consciousness.

She published Working in Public, a book about the evolution of open-source development, with Stripe Press.

We get into:</p><ul><li><strong>Jhana as a means to nurture profound joy and calm. </strong>Unlike many meditation practices that emphasize passive observation, Jhana is goal-oriented—practitioners proactively cultivate states of concentrated bliss.

She draws on psychologist Julian Jaynes’s theory that our inner dialogue—what we often equate with consciousness—only emerged in humans a few thousand years ago; a provocation to reconsider the benchmarks we use to assess the intelligence or sentience of LLMs.</li><li><strong>What it is like to experience a “cessation.”</strong> On her last meditation retreat, Nadia experiences a cessation where your consciousness abruptly winks out—like suddenly flipping a switch. Nadia described it as slipping into nothingness, then returning with the jarring realization that even your sense of self can vanish and reappear.</li><li><strong>Why she likes the unknowability of AI. </strong>The mechanics of exactly how LLMs predict their next token remain a mystery.

        <![CDATA[<p>Sarah Tavel thinks it's criminal that ChatGPT isn’t inherently social.</p><p><br></p><p>There’s no easy way to discover great prompts or share the ones that worked. As a venture partner at Benchmark, Sarah believes that the next wave of consumer AI will be built on this missing social layer—by product-driven founders who understand people, not just models. </p><p><br></p><p>Sarah has seen this shift before. As one of Pinterest’s first product managers, she saw the company grow from a niche consumer tool to a beloved global community. On this episode of Every's podcast <em>AI &amp; I</em>, we talk about how she’s applying the lessons she learned to AI—and what it takes to build a breakout consumer AI app today. </p><p>We get into:</p><ul><li><strong>Why product geniuses win as new tech matures. </strong>In the early days of a new technology, companies win by wrangling raw innovation into something usable. But as the infrastructure matures, Sarah says the edge shifts to product thinkers—founders who turn new capabilities into delightful user experiences.</li><li><strong>The future of prompting is social. </strong>When Sarah had to dig through Reddit to find a prompt to help her interpret her blood test results, she saw a gap: The best prompt creators are invisible. Sarah bets that a social AI product that makes them discoverable and followable would gain traction.</li><li><strong>Sarah’s method to spot exceptional founders. </strong>Sarah backs founders for whom building a company feels like a calling—or even an affliction. These are people who have fallen in love with the process and are obsessed with learning how to grow alongside their companies.</li><li><strong>How to tell if your startup really has network effects. </strong>Founders raising money love to say that their business has “network effects.” Sarah has learned to look for early signs they’re real—like traction in a small, white-hot segment of the market. If there’s no evidence the flywheel is already starting to spin, it’s probably not a network effect.</li><li><strong>How LLMs change the way the best VCs invest.</strong> Sarah thinks the future of venture will be shaped by how well VCs can turn the decisions they make into training data.

Kevin realized that the stories no one else at Wired wanted to write were often the ones he was suited for, and trusting that instinct led to some of his best work.</li></ul><p>This is a must-watch for anyone who wants to make sense of AI through the lens of history, learn how to spot the future before it arrives, or grew up reading Wired.</p><p><br>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p>I interviewed the Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy on AI &amp; I. </p><p><br></p><p>We spent an hour talking about his vision for AI in government, economic development, and the regulatory challenges ahead. His approach is refreshingly pragmatic: </p><ul><li>Spark real innovation at scale. Governor Murphy is laying the groundwork through an AI hub that pools the strengths of the government, academia (Princeton University), legacy tech (Microsoft), and next-gen players (CoreWeave). </li><li>Creating a place for the brightest minds to live and work. He’s making the Garden State irresistible for the best talent through walkable communities, legal recreational cannabis, and an angel investment tax credit.</li><li><strong>AI that augments teams, instead of replacing them. </strong>The Governor sees AI as an “accelerant” that enables teams to do more with the same number of employees. He’s walking the talk by training 61,000 NJ state employees in AI to automate busy work and free them to focus on strategic tasks.</li><li>An integrated regulatory framework for AI. He believes that a technology as pervasive as AI should be regulated at a national level because the state-by-state approach could stifle innovation. </li></ul><p>Governor Phil Murphy is the first governor I’ve ever had on the show and I was honored he took the time to come on. I was also especially excited to do this because I grew up in New Jersey! This is a must watch for anyone interested in the intersection of AI and policy.</p><p><br></p><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt</a>.

A new breed of companies is emerging, and I invited Mike on the show to talk about how they can best strategize. Last year, Mike co-authored a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Breakers-Start-Ups-Change-Future/dp/1541704355"><em>Pattern Breakers</em></a>, which is essentially a guidebook to why there’s no guidebook to building companies. I really liked it, and my colleague <strong>Evan Armstrong</strong> <a href="https://every.to/napkin-math/a-new-book-of-the-startup-bible">reviewed it</a> for Every, so I was glad to have him on. We talk about how shifts in technology create space for smaller players to compete—even with AI giants like OpenAI—and how to capitalize on them.</p><p><br></p><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://x.com/nateliason"><strong>Nat Eliason</strong></a>’s career arc is borderline absurd—but it works. </p><p><br></p><p>In the last five years, he ran an SEO agency, got into crypto, made $600,000 from a course on the note-taking tool <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, flipped real estate in Austin for a 6x return, and published a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593714040">book</a> with Random House. He’s now writing a book of science fiction and running a viral <a href="https://www.buildyourownapps.com/">course</a> about building apps with AI.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ve known Nat for a long time, and I think he knows where the puck is headed better than anyone. He’ll see a new tool or trend, master it, build a business around it, and move on. Nat’s pulled it off with crypto, Roam, real estate—and now AI. His app-building course has over 800 students and racked up $200,000 in pre-sales in one week.</p><p><br></p><p>Nat was <a href="https://every.to/podcast/chatgpt-for-writing-and-recommending-books">one of the first guests</a> I had on the podcast and I was delighted to have him on again. We spent an hour talking about how coding with AI is creating new behaviors in programming, Nat’s best practices for using the coding tool Cursor, and his take on the future of writing with AI. </p><p><br></p><p>This episode is a must-watch for writers, creators, and anyone interested in the future of product building.</p><p><br></p><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt</a>.

Few people straddle the worlds of science and AI like she does: She holds a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience from Yale and is a machine learning researcher with almost a decade of experience. In 2021, she founded re:collect, an app that aimed to augment human intelligence with AI. It was <a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/2024/09/26/from-recollect-founder-to-smartnews-reflections-on-why-what-we-consume-shapes-our-thinking/">acqui-hired</a> by news curation app <a href="https://www.smartnews.com/en">SmartNews</a> in September of this year, and she is now the senior director of AI product. </p><p><br></p><p>We discuss the contours of this new paradigm of science: the growing importance of data in scientific discovery, how AI makes N-of-1 studies imperative—when they’re normally seen as unscientific, the case for big tech to open-source their data for research, and the power of unbundling data from interpretations, in both science and media. Here is a link to the episode transcript. </p><p><br></p><p>In January of this year, we published Alice’s <a href="https://every.to/p/the-case-for-cyborgs">thesis</a> about how augmenting human intelligence with AI is more effective than attempting to achieve super intelligence through standalone AI systems, and in a happy coincidence, she’s our last podcast guest of 2024. Thank you for listening, and we’ll see you in the new year.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, this is a must-watch for anyone interested in how AI is changing the future of scientific research.</p><p><br></p><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p>Prompt engineering isn’t just about telling AI to solve your problems—it’s about knowing which ones to solve. </p><p><br></p><p>Yet there’s a mismatch between the people who can identify the right problems—experts with deep domain knowledge—and the technical infrastructure required for developing and refining prompts. <a href="https://x.com/imjaredz">Jared Zoneraich</a>, the cofounder and CEO of prompt engineering platform <a href="https://www.promptlayer.com/">PromptLayer</a>, is bridging the gap with a platform on which non-technical experts can manage, deploy, and evaluate prompts quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>The role of human prompt engineers, however, has been the topic of controversy, with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead">some</a> arguing that AI can optimize prompts better than us, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230108000408/https://greylock.com/greymatter/sam-altman-ai-for-the-next-era/">others</a> suggest that more capable LLMs eliminate the need for meticulously crafted prompts altogether. I spent an hour talking to Jared about why he believes prompt engineering isn’t becoming obsolete. He also tells me everything he’s learned about writing a good prompt and what the future of AI tools looks like. Here is a link to the <a href="https://every.to/podcast/transcript-how-to-win-with-prompt-engineering">episode transcript</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a must-watch for prompt engineers, people interested in building with AI systems, or anyone who wants to generate predictably good responses from LLMs.</p><p><br></p><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want even more?</strong></p><p>Sign up for Every to unlock our <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT</a>.

Before conducting each of these interviews, Dwarkesh learns as much as he can about his guest and their area of expertise—AI hardware, tense geopolitical crises, and the genetics of human origins, to name a few. </p><p>The most important tool in his learning arsenal? AI—specifically Claude, Claude Projects, and a few custom tools he’s built to accelerate his workflow.</p><p>He does this by researching extensively, and as his knowledge grows, each piece of new information builds upon the last, making it easier and easier to grasp meaningful insights. </p><p>In this interview, I turn the tables on him to understand how the prolific podcaster uses AI to become a smarter version of himself. We get into:</p><p>- How he uses LLMs to remember everything<br>- His podcast prep workflow with Claude to understand complex topics<br>- Why it’s important to be an early adopter of technology<br>- His taste in books and how he uses LLMs to learn from them<br>- How he thinks about building a worldview <br>- His quick takes on the AI’s existential questions—AGI and P(doom)</p><p>We also use Claude live on the show to help Dwarkesh research for an upcoming podcast recording.</p><p>This is a must-watch for curious people who want to use AI to become smarter.</p><p>If you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share! </p><p>Want even more?<br>Sign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt.

        <![CDATA[<p>Claire Vo built ChatPRD—an on-demand chief product officer powered by AI.

        <![CDATA[<p>An interview with best-selling sci-fi novelist Robin Sloan</p><p>One of my favorite fiction writers, <em>New York Times </em>best-selling author <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/">Robin Sloan</a>, just wrote the first novel I’ve seen that’s inspired by LLMs.</p><p><br></p><p>The book is called <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound/"><em>Moonbound</em></a>, and Robin originally wanted to write it with language models. He tried doing this in 2016 with a rudimentary model he built himself, and more recently with commercially available LLMs. Both times Robin found himself unsatisfied with the creative output generated by the models. AI couldn’t quite generate the fiction he was looking for—the kind that pushes the boundaries of literature.</p><p><br></p><p>He did, however, find himself fascinated by the inner workings of LLMs</p><p><br></p><p>Robin was particularly interested in how LLMs map language into math—the notion that each letter is represented by a unique series of numbers, allowing the model to understand human language in a computational way. He thinks LLMs are language personified, given its first heady dose of autonomy. </p><p><br></p><p>Robin’s body of work reflects his deep understanding of technology, language, and storytelling.

        <![CDATA[<p>Learn how to use philosophy to run your business more effectively</p><p>Reid Hoffman thinks a masters in philosophy will help you run your business better than an MBA.</p><p><br></p><p>Reid is the cofounder of LinkedIn, a partner at venture capital firm <a href="https://greylock.com/">Greylock Partners</a>, the host of the <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/about-us/"><em>Masters of Scale</em></a><em> </em>podcast, and a prolific <a href="https://www.reidhoffman.org/books/">author</a>. But before he did any of these things, Reid studied philosophy—and by helping him understand how to think, it made him a better entrepreneur.</p><p> </p><p>A good student of philosophy rigorously engages with questions about truth, human nature, and the meaning of life, and, over time, learns how to think clearly about the big picture.

        <![CDATA[<p>You can build and run a one-person internet business that earns half a million in annual revenue—with AI. </p><p>Ben Tossell showed me exactly how in this episode.

Ben is also an experienced founder whose no-code platform Makerpad was acquired by Zapier. </p><p>I think Ben is really good at starting profitable internet businesses that are sneakily big, but don’t require too many resources. Over the last couple of years, he’s assembled a war chest of AI tools including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Lex, and Supernormal to help him do this. In this episode, we get into the weeds of how Ben has integrated AI into his workflow to find new business opportunities, run them well, and evaluate their performance.  </p><p>We get into: <br>- How to use ChatGPT as a business strategist<br>- Building your MVP with ChatGPT<br>- Turning interview transcripts into compelling articles <br>- Analyzing business data using AI tools<br>- How to generate persuasive landing page copy with ChatGPT<br>- Offload time-consuming tasks to AI</p><p>This episode is a must-watch for anyone who is curious about using AI to bootstrap a profitable internet business. </p><p>Want even more?<br>Sign up for Every to unlock our <a href="https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt">ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes ChatGPT is a copilot, sitting beside you, taking directions, and guiding you as you fly through your work. At other times, it’s a subordinate. It’s not just an assistant or a companion, but a trusted deputy, someone—or something—that’ll heed instructions and complete tasks.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how our guest, Nathan Labenz, thinks about ChatGPT. In this episode, Labenz—the founder of the AI video company Waymark and the host of his own podcast called <em>The Cognitive Revolution</em>—uses ChatGPT to write complex code in languages he’s unfamiliar with, saving days worth of time in the process.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like machines replaced muscles during the Industrial Revolution, AI will one day replace brainpower. Maybe with ChatGPT, we can offload some of the drudgery of everyday work and focus on work that’s actually important.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>How Nat Eliason uses ChatGPT to write books:

<a href="https://twitter.com/nateliason" rel="noopener noreferer">Nat Eliason</a> is a shape-shifter.

He’s a writer with a book deal from Random House, a crypto trader, a Roam Research aficionado, a marketer, a book podcaster, a parent, and a seed oil iconoclast. He's amassed thousands of newsletter subscribers, 70,000 followers on X, and 110,000 on TikTok. 

His secret weapon for all of his exploring? ChatGPT.

Nat took me through why he uses it every day for his work and his life. In this interview we talk about using ChatGPT for:

Identifying his taste in writing. He uses ChatGPT to help him identify the kind of writing he likes, so that he can produce more of it.

Finding new books to read for inspiration. ChatGPT helps him find writers and books that he never would've encountered through Googling or in his daily life.

Generating story outlines and character descriptions. He uses ChatGPT to help him outline the sci-fi novel he's writing and learn how to create vivid descriptions.

Settling bar bets. Air in the atmosphere contains carbon—which can technically be converted into diamond. So, how much air would be required to make a diamond? It's the kind of thing you might argue about over drinks with a friend—and exactly the kind of question ChatGPT is built to answer. 

Reading the news. Nat doesn't read the news. But every once in a while he wants to know what's going on about a particular topic. ChatGPT is the perfect news summarizer.

Generating recipes. Nat is a frequent chef. ChatGPT is his recipe companion: surfacing ideas, and easily modifying them based on what he has at hand and his family's dietary preferences.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>About the show</strong></p>
<p>I believe that ChatGPT is the most important creative tool of the decade. I think it can help us <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/writing-essays-with-ai-a-guide?sid=28008">write better</a>, create art, efficiently <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/you-re-a-developer-now">ship products</a>, build great businesses, make <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/ai-assisted-decision-making">smart decisions</a>, and even <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-is-the-best-journal-i-ve-ever-used?sid=28011">learn something about ourselves</a>,.</p>
<p>But it’s still so early. Most of us don’t even really know how to use ChatGPT. We have a feeling that it’s powerful, interesting, and important—but we haven’t figured out how to incorporate it into our lives.</p>
<p>There are a few people, though, who are living in the future. They have the time and curiousity to use ChatGPT in their everyday lives, taking the opportunity to make the technology work for them. In this way, they light the way for everyone else. </p>
<p>That’s what this interview series, <em>How I Use ChatGPT</em>, is all about. We go in-depth with the most interesting people in the world to learn concrete ways they are already using ChatGPT. It won’t be theoretical—or limited to audio: we’ll screen-share and see their actual prompts and responses, so you can see how ChatGPT helps them perform better at work and improve their lives—one conversation at a time. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>About this episode</strong></p>
<p>My first guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/shl" rel="noopener noreferer">Sahil Lavingia</a>, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://gumroad.com" rel="noopener noreferer">Gumroad</a>, one of the largest platforms for creators to sell their work online. He shared how he uses ChatGPT for:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Buying a building.</strong> He wants to buy a New York City hangout for Gumroad employees and customers, so he asked ChatGPT to research the history of real estate in NYC, suggest which neighborhoods might be best to target, generate questions for brokers, and even detail what the design of a particular property might look like.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Writing tweets.</strong> Sahil is a prolific Twitter/X user. He often uses ChatGPT to help him flesh out an idea. He says, “I [start] with a tweet, which is like a thesis, and then I just say, ‘Add three to four paragraphs to make the point compelling—also suggest more examples.’” We explore his precise process for using ChatGPT to help him brainstorm short tweets and longer essays in this episode.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Pressure-testing ideas.</strong> For Sahil, ChatGPT is like upgrading his peripheral vision. It lets him see around the corners, ask better questions of himself and other people, and avoid poor decisions. He told me, “I think a lot of people sort of delude themselves into thinking they have [good ideas]… I think that one of the most useful things about [ChatGPT] is it focuses your research on what actually matters.” It’s the ultimate tool to help him think better.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also in this episode: how ChatGPT could have helped Sahil save $70 million, how he thinks it will improve the most-talented creatives, and why he thinks—in the age of AI—people have no excuse for not knowing the answer to something anymore.</p>

 <li>Intro 0:33</li>
 <li>There’s no more excuse for not knowing anymore 2:00</li>
 <li>He doesn’t spend as much time on bad ideas 2:50</li>
 <li>How ChatGPT will make the top 1% of creative output better 6:15</li>
  <li>How it turbocharges research 8:20</li>
  <li>How he’s using ChatGPT to buy a building 11:00</li>
  <li>How he uses ChatGPT to pressure-test ideas 17:43</li>

      <itunes:summary>About the show
I believe that ChatGPT is the most important creative tool of the decade. I think it can help us write better, create art, efficiently ship products, build great businesses, make smart decisions, and even learn something about ourselves,.
But it’s still so early. Most of us don’t even really know how to use ChatGPT. We have a feeling that it’s powerful, interesting, and important—but we haven’t figured out how to incorporate it into our lives.
There are a few people, though, who are living in the future. They have the time and curiousity to use ChatGPT in their everyday lives, taking the opportunity to make the technology work for them. In this way, they light the way for everyone else. 
That’s what this interview series, How I Use ChatGPT, is all about. We go in-depth with the most interesting people in the world to learn concrete ways they are already using ChatGPT. It won’t be theoretical—or limited to audio: we’ll screen-share and see their actual prompts and responses, so you can see how ChatGPT helps them perform better at work and improve their lives—one conversation at a time. 

About this episode
My first guest is Sahil Lavingia, the co-founder and CEO of Gumroad, one of the largest platforms for creators to sell their work online. He shared how he uses ChatGPT for:

Buying a building. He wants to buy a New York City hangout for Gumroad employees and customers, so he asked ChatGPT to research the history of real estate in NYC, suggest which neighborhoods might be best to target, generate questions for brokers, and even detail what the design of a particular property might look like.

Writing tweets. Sahil is a prolific Twitter/X user. He often uses ChatGPT to help him flesh out an idea. He says, “I [start] with a tweet, which is like a thesis, and then I just say, ‘Add three to four paragraphs to make the point compelling—also suggest more examples.’” We explore his precise process for using ChatGPT to help him brainstorm short tweets and longer essays in this episode.

Pressure-testing ideas. For Sahil, ChatGPT is like upgrading his peripheral vision. It lets him see around the corners, ask better questions of himself and other people, and avoid poor decisions. He told me, “I think a lot of people sort of delude themselves into thinking they have [good ideas]… I think that one of the most useful things about [ChatGPT] is it focuses your research on what actually matters.” It’s the ultimate tool to help him think better.

Also in this episode: how ChatGPT could have helped Sahil save $70 million, how he thinks it will improve the most-talented creatives, and why he thinks—in the age of AI—people have no excuse for not knowing the answer to something anymore.
