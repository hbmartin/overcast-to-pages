                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I welcomed back Sara Reusche (she/her)! Sara is a CBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, CVT, and owns Paws Abilities Dog Training, LLC in Southeast Minnesota and the Twin Cities metro. Sara and I talked about what we mean by the term sports lite versus sport bred, what the sports lite dogs she's bred look like - and how everyone deserves an easy dog, even those who want to do sports. To learn more about Sara's training program go to https://pawsabilitiesmn.com/ (they have online offerings so you don't have to be local!) and to learn more about her breeding program check out https://www.facebook.com/puzdog.</p>
<p>In this episode we talk a bit about where people might go to find a sports lite dog and what kinds of questions to ask a breeder. If you're looking for a puppy or adult dog, I highly recommend checking out the Puppy Seekers Project. They have a group on Facebook which is incredibly helpful in the puppy search, and when you get there, ask them about how to get recommendations for specific breeders. If you're interested in learning more about breeders who prioritize the goals of the Functional Dog Collaborative, that is the place to go!</p>

In this episode, Carm and I talk about conflict in the dog breeding world - and in dog training, human politics, and other parts of life. Why are we as humans so likely to fall into conflict with others? Why is it so hard to convince others of your viewpoint when you're in conflict with them? How can we do things differently so we can start having meaningful conversations with others in which we and they are able to think deeply about why we believe what we believe?</p>
<p>To learn more about Carm, check out <a href='https://www.northstartraining.info/'>https://www.northstartraining.info/</a> - note that in addition to dog training services, she does consults to help with conflict resolution.</p>
<p>In this episode, Carm and I talk about a lot of books that she recommends. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection, by Charles Duhigg</li>
<li>How Minds Change: The Surprising Science of Belief, Opinion, and Persuasion, by David McRaney</li>

She also studies how health affects canine behavior and welfare, and - the reason I asked her on for this episode - how companion animal owners make decisions about their dogs, and how to improve those decisions in line with animal welfare. Rowena and I talked about why people love brachycephalic dogs so much and why so many people seem to have trouble recognizing when their dog has breathing issues. We also talked about hope for the future and the way forward to maintaining the characteristic look of shorter muzzled dogs without such a high risk of welfare compromise.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is just me (Jessica Perry Hekman, DVM, PhD) - talking about a new genetic test for the risk of mitral valve disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Cavs are at incredibly high risk of this disease and get it at much younger ages than other breeds. What does this new test mean in terms of predicting if your Cav is at risk, and whether a particular Cav should be bred?</p>
<p>I talk about several papers in this episode. If you want to check them out yourself, they are:</p>

Her book, The Dog Merchants, is a fascinating read for anyone who wants a look at places few of us are able to go, such as a dog auction or a high volume kennel-based breeding operation. Kim and I talked about the ins and outs of the complex industry that has grown up around puppy production, including large scale breeding and rescue operations.</p>
<p>In this interview, the two of us are describing a system that is absolutely sub-optimal with regard to canine welfare. While we did discuss how some parts of the system may not be as abhorrent as they've been described elsewhere, I want to be clear that one of the goals of the Functional Dog Collaborative is to make change in exactly this area. So please do not confuse our descriptions of what is existing for our approval of it.</p>

Jane is a veterinary surgeon who is widely known as an expert on BOAS, or brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome. BOAS is the umbrella disorder that covers a variety of different airflow obstructions in different flat-faced breeds such as the pug, French bulldog, and English bulldog. Jane developed the Respiratory Function Grading Scheme, a straightforward clinical exam which allows grading of a BOAS-effected dog. Jane works with the Kennel Club in the UK to promote this scheme, which is also being rolled out in other countries including the US. I was really pleased to get to talk to Jane about BOAS, her grading scheme, and what this means for breeding healthy brachycephalic dogs.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I'm talking with the researchers who recently published a paper that's been getting a lot of social media buzz. The paper's title is "The doodle dilemma: How the physical health of ‘Designer-crossbreed’ Cockapoo, Labradoodle and Cavapoo dogs’ compares to their purebred progenitor breeds." This interview was a big party featuring Gina Bryson, the first author on the paper, as well as two researchers from Royal Veterinary College, Dr Rowena Packer, and Dr Dan O'Neill, who has been a guest on the podcast before. Gina, Rowena, and Dan walked me through what the paper does and does not tell us about the health of some specific common crosses compared to the parent breeds, and also let me know about additional data that they collected that we'll be seeing in some future papers from the group.</p>
<p>A quick side note that they refer a few times to the RVC, which is the Royal Veterinary College, the institution where they work.</p>
<p>And another side note - I've started going by my middle name, Perry, because I like it better. My pronouns are still she/her. You'll hear Dan call me Perry a few times during this episode and I didn't want anyone to be confused by that. Jessica is still my legal and professional name - if it helps to contextualize, you can think of Perry as a nickname.</p>
<p>On with the episode!</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This week you get just me (Jessica Perry Hekman) talking at you! I'm talking about the coefficient of inbreeding (COI), a measurement of genetic diversity that's commonly mentioned in discussions of individual and breed health. I talk about what it is, how to interpret it, how to get the measurement done for your own dog(s), why we care about it, and give the take-home messages from some papers with evidence for its importance in dog specifically. COI is not the only thing you should be breeding for, and it's rarely even the most important thing - but it's something we should keep in mind when we are working in closed gene pools.</p>
<p>NOTE: Oops, I said in the episode that the MDR1 mutation is recessive. It's not - it's incompletely dominant, meaning that dogs can be affected even with only one copy of the mutant allele. I apologize - please note the mistake as the correct information is important here.</p>
<ul><li>I mention some previous podcast episodes with related material - you can find them here:

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode I welcome back Mary Peaslee, MD, MPH, to talk about a breeder's perspective on all the advice Dr Dan O'Neill gave us in his recent episode on how to approach disorder testing. Mary works in population health and brings that perspective to her breeding practice. So what does all this stuff look like in the real world? How can breeders focus on the future health of the dog population they work with? What are some challenges they'll encounter? Mary has some great advice and perspective that I hope will help people think through their breeding goals and approaches.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>We have a flipped episode this week with Sarah Stremming of Cog Dog Radio interviewing me. We're talking about the new paper out of the Dog Aging Project, "Lifetime Prevalence of Owner-Reported Medical Conditions in the 25 Most Common Dog Breeds in the Dog Aging Project Pack." There's been a lot of buzz on social media about this paper and we wanted to dig in to its findings. For those who saw our live Q&amp;A about the paper, this interview covers very similar ground, although we go into some more detail. I'll include links to this study and others below, and if you want to ask questions about the paper, the Functional Breeding Facebook group is a great place to do it!</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Last episode I talked with Dr. Dan O'Neill, a veterinary epidemiologist who studies canine disorders that have an inherited component - what the rest of us might call "genetic diseases." During that interview he mentioned that he didn't think disorder testing - what most of us call health testing - has been workinig to improve canine health. I cut that section because I felt we needed to go into a lot more detail on it to understand what he meant by that, since I knew he didn't mean we should entirely stop health testing - I mean disorder testing. So here is the followup interview. I want to emphasize that he isn't saying disorder testing shouldn't be done as an aid to choosing how to breed dogs. He IS saying that the way we approach choosing and interpreting tests could use a revamp. I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did!</p>

Danika's laboratory found the genetic mutation that was targeted in this outcross, and she had a front row seat to the project's path to acceptance by the AKC and the Dalmatian Club of America. She is also herself a past breeder of Dalmatians. Danika walks us through the genetic, social, and practical implications of high uric acid in Dalmatians, why the outcross was necessary, how it worked, and which populations with different mutations could be helped today by a similar approach (spoiler - one of them is the population of dogs in breeds with high frequency of the chondrodystrophy mutation that we discussed in the previous episode).</p>

She also happens to run a genetics lab, also at UC Davis, where she studies the genetics of inherited diseases in dogs and other animals. She is known for her work associating genetic variants with a variety of traits including coat color and skull shape. On this episode we're talking about a genetic mutation that she discovered - known to genetic testing companies as CDDY - for a trait she feels passionately about, chondrodystrophy. Most of the dog world knows this mutation as "that risk gene that makes your dog more likely to get IVDD," but in this episode, Danika talks us through the difference between disc herniation and IVDD (intervertebral disc disease), noting that all dogs with CDDY have IVDD, and therefore disc degeneration, whether or not they actually herniate. I hope you learn as much from this discussion as I did.</p>

Lisa’s research explores the behavior and welfare of companion animals, specifically our interactions with them, as it relates to animal sheltering, behavioral issues, and training. Lisa combines a love of research with hands-on dog training skills. I wanted to have someone from the shelter world on the podcast because, depending on what you mean by "source," shelters are a source of dogs. Lisa and I talked about how shelters can best help dogs cope with the shelter experience and what the future of sheltering might look like.</p>

Dr Sophie Liu  is a veterinarian specializing in behavior and the founder of the Doberman Diversity Project, about which she's spoken previously on this podcast. Both of them are passionate about dogs not just as part of their careers but as part of their lives. They joined me to talk through the findings in their paper, which sheds some light on the complicated story of health and genetic diversity in Dobermans.
Wade, Claire M., Robin Nuttall, and Sophie Liu. "Comprehensive analysis of geographic and breed-purpose influences on genetic diversity and inherited disease risk in the Doberman dog breed." Canine Medicine and Genetics 10.1 (2023): 1-17.https://cgejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40575-023-00130-3]]></itunes:summary>

I keep hearing about the great work she is doing to address health issues in her French bulldogs, and I was so enthusiastic to get a chance to ask her for more details. Lisa is a CKC registered breeder. Her breeding program is called Of Autumn, and you can most easily reach her on Facebook.</p>

She consults at The Cognitive Canine, teaches online courses on dog behavior, and hosts the Cog Dog Radio Podcast. I sat down with Sarah to talk about the recent news that SPCA Tampa Bay has partnered with a pet store and a puppy broker - and what we think this means we all should REALLY be talking about. Although the shelter's pilot program was paused due to community feedback before we released the episode, we feel the issues we discuss in here are still critical ones to ensuring the welfare of the dogs we share our lives with.</p>

I'm a veterinarian turned behavioral geneticist turned teacher and founder of the Functional Dog Collaborative, or FDC. I graduated from Tufts Veterinary School in 2012 with a dual veterinary and master's degree, which was on stress in hospitalized dogs. I completed a veterinary shelter medicine specialty internship at Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida. I completed a PhD in Genetics, Genomics, and Biomedical Sciences in Kukekova Lab at the University of Illinois, studying genetic differences in the stress system in lines of foxes bred to be less afraid of humans compared to foxes bred to be aggressive. I did post-doctoral work at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and now teach online for Virginia Tech and run the FDC. Ji asked me to talk about the FDC - how it's coming, what we're doing, what we need help with. So here it is!</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second part of my epic interview with Mary Peaslee about hip testing. As I said in part one, I highly value Mary's insights about hip testing for a whole bunch of reasons. She's a medical doctor with an additional master's in public health, specializing in preventive medicine, so she has extensive training in understanding screening tests just like the kinds of tests we do for hip health. As for her dog cred, she has been breeding English Shepherds for over 20 years, with a focus on growing and sustaining a healthy breed population. She's been very involved in the breed, earning herding trial championships, and serving on the the board of directors for the English Shepherd Breed Conservancy, English Shepherd Club, and the American Herding Breed Association. Mary has volunteered for FDC for several years and we've had many discussions about health testing and breeding. We've talked a lot recently about hip testing and I asked her to come onto the podcast to tell us her thoughts. If you haven't listened to part one yet, I recommend you check that one out first!</p>

Sarah Stremming (internationally known behavior consultant and podcaster, and member of the FDC Advisory Board) and I dig in to what the "functional" in "Functional Dog Collaborative" means. What are the FDC's guidelines in terms of health and behavior for dogs in a truly "functional" breeding program? How can you assess whether a program is "functional"? This episode is also being released through Sarah's podcast, Cog Dog Radio. I hope it answers some questions that have been out there in internet land!</p>

They talked about the expectations we have of dogs and whether they are reasonable; the limits of training to manage dogs in the wrong environments; and the ethical dilemma of "dog keeping" in an increasingly urban world. We also touched on how our relationships and expectations of dogs as pets are influenced by larger social issues. My guests are: Jacqueline George, MA, who works with people seeking puppies to help match them to the right breeder, shelter, or rescue; Sammy Hyde, KPA-CTP, CPDT-KA, UW-AAB, a dog trainer in the Boston area; and Laura Sharkey, PhD, KPA-CTP and Carolyn Kelly, MSN, RN, the founders of the Copilot Pet Dog Breeding Cooperative, both of whom have experience breeding dogs for pet homes. These four women have a lot of fascinating experience and insights and I hope you enjoy their conversation as much as I did.</p>

She's an extremely knowledgeable and science-minded breeder. I know that there are a lot of questions about there about how outcross projects work and what we can expect from them, and I hope this episode helps answer some of your questions.</p>
<p>(Note: I'm really glad to be back recording my first episode in more than a year. As many of you know, I have post concussive syndrome after a fall on ice a year ago, somewhat hilariously followed by a shattered ankle in June of last year which also delayed my recovery. It's been a long road but I'm starting to be able to record episodes again. I don't know what the episode schedule will look like as I start to get my feet back under me. For now, I'm doing what I can when I can.)</p>

Her area of interest is canine cognition, and she specifically studies the effects of different styles of maternal care on the adult personalities of dogs - in other words, does how your mom treats you affect who you will grow up to be? In this episode, Emily and I talk about what's known about maternal care generally in animals and people before diving into her studies in dogs and what she learned from them.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Elinor Karlsson, Ph.D., is the director of the Vetebrate Genomics Group at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and (incidentally) my boss. She has a deep knowledge about both population genetics and what we call "complex trait genomics," or the genetics of hard to pin down things like risk of developing cancer or a behavior problem. Elinor talked with me about a recent paper that looked for genetic variants associated with diseases in a large number of dogs from many breeds and mixes. She discusses what this paper found and some ways to intepret those findings. The paper is Donner, Jonas, et al. "Frequency and distribution of 152 genetic disease variants in over 100,000 mixed breed and purebred dogs." PLoS genetics 14.4 (2018): e1007361. <a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007361'>https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007361</a>.</p>

If you didn't listen to last week's episode where Eldin talked about his career before the IWDR, definitely check that out first. In this episode, he tells us all about the IWDR, how it helps gather large populations of dogs together to provide more data - and analyze that data! - to help breeders improve their breeding decisions, and whether it's useful for more than just working dogs.

In this episode, Eldin talks to us about how he got where he is now and gets super nerdy about the ins and outs of selecting breeding animals for the traits you want, from cattle to seeing eye dogs. (We love nerdy.) Eldin had so much good information that this ended up being two episodes, so stay tuned for part two next week.</p>
<p>The papers Eldin mentions in this episode are:</p>
<ul><li>Leighton, Eldin A., et al. "Genetic improvement of hip-extended scores in 3 breeds of guide dogs using estimated breeding values: Notable progress but more improvement is needed." PloS one 14.2 (2019): e0212544. <a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212544'>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212544</a></li>
<li>Kealy, Richard D., et al. "Evaluation of the effect of limited food consumption on radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis in dogs." Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 217.11 (2000): 1678-1680. <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.204.1848&rep=rep1&type=pdf'>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.204.1848&rep=rep1&type=pdf</a></li>

A breeding cooperative is a group of breeders with similar goals who exchange animals to form a larger breeding population than they could on their own. In this episode, Marina gets down and dirty with the details of how to put together and run a breeding cooperative, and wraps up with some insights on how she makes guardian homes (placing dogs in pet homes but keeping breeding rights) work for her. If you're a breeder who has ever struggled with how to keep enough potential breeding dogs in a house with limited space, this episode may be for you.</p>
