  <description><![CDATA[<div>Welcome to Data Brew by Databricks with Denny and Brooke! In this series, we explore various topics in the data and AI community and interview subject matter experts in data engineering/data science. So join us with your morning brew in hand and get ready to dive deep into data + AI! For this first season, we will be focusing on lakehouses – combining the key features of data warehouses, such as ACID transactions, with the scalability of data lakes, directly against low-cost object stores.</div>]]></description>
