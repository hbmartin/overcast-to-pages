    <description>Casual conversations with founders, technologists, investors, and artists about building a brighter future, together. Welcome to our digital living room. 
With science, technology and entrepreneurship we can *continue* to create unfathomable leaps in quality of life. We show you how to find, apply, build, and invest in technologies to change your life and the world. 
When we have smart friends, we do smart things. When we do smart things, we save the world. 
No matter who, where, or when you are – now you have smart friends, too. 
Outside this podcast, I’m the author of The Almanack of Naval Ravikant and The Anthology of Balaji. Connect at ejorgenson.com 
Laugh and learn with people like Balaji Srinivasan, Naval Ravikant, Andrew Wilkinson, Austen Allred, David Senra, Josh Storrs Hall, Ashley Rindsberg, Zach Pettet, Bret Kugelmass, Omar ElNaggar, Grace Guo, Brett Kopf, Max Olson, Chris Williamson, Shane Mac, Tim Hwang, David Perell, Jason Hitchcock, Natalia Karayaneva, Sebastian Marshall, Taylor Pearson, Mitchell Baldridge and more.
Join conversations with my partners in early-stage tech investing, Bo Fishback and Al Doan. Our Rolling Fun Episodes cover our investments and escapades as angel investors and startup helpers. We invest in startups creating the *next* industrial revolution. Learn more at rolling.fun

We discuss:


  
Why tying your identity to your company can be both a strength and a liability



  
The critical decision to shut down a beautiful but unused blockchain product—and return investor money



  
How trusted digital IDs could change how we prove who we are—from checking out online to entering a secure facility



  
Why simply having a trusted device could be a stronger way to log in and why invisible two-factor might be the future



  
What it’s like to run a global fintech startup from Kansas City and the cultural learnings that come with it








Quotes from Toby:


  
“When the company is dying, that doesn’t mean I’m dying. And when it’s thriving, that doesn’t mean I’m a good person.”



  
“You should absolutely take a window of time when one chapter ends—just having time to yourself is all the justification you need.”



  
“Two-factor authentication is alive and well—it’s just invisible now.”



  
“We reduce friction for the user, fraud for the merchant, and cost for everyone.”



  
“If you’re serving two totally different customers with one product, you probably have two companies.”



  
“The magic moment is at checkout—remove friction there and everything gets better.”



  
“Passwords are terrible. If I can just look at my phone and log in, that’s a win.”



  
“You need friends who can sing your soul’s song back to you when you’ve lost the melody.”



  
“From almost out of money to a $100 million term sheet in five weeks—that’s the startup rollercoaster.”



  
“Authenticity, credibility, and trust are incalculable in value.”



  
“If the thesis is right but the timing is off, you can build something beautiful that no one uses.”



  
“Stop with the techno-babble. We won’t call them NFTs—we’ll just call them useful.”






Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship

 

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant

 

You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  

 

Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. </description>

Quotes from Nat:


  
“Writing is the one thing I love doing enough to commit to for the next 30 years.”



  
“Traditional publishing taught me how to make a really good book, but I wouldn’t do it again.”



  
“Holding your book for the first time—and shipping it yourself to your first readers—is pure magic.”



  
“The best marketing for your book is writing the next one—that’s the fiction game.”



  
“I used to chase whatever was interesting… now I’m building something I want to last 30 years.”



  
“Fiction lets me explore big ideas without pretending to be an expert.”



  
“The self-pub stigma is fading… especially when the book looks and reads like a trad pub hit.”



  
“Characters start doing things I didn’t plan—then I realize, oh, that’s why they’re here.”



  
“There’s no product in the world like a book—you can sell the same file for 50 years.”



  
“My dream is to have a warehouse full of books I wrote. That’s the romantic version of success.”</description>

Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship

 

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant

 

You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  

 

Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. 

Quotes from Nat:


  
“Writing is the one thing I love doing enough to commit to for the next 30 years.”



  
“Traditional publishing taught me how to make a really good book, but I wouldn’t do it again.”



  
“Holding your book for the first time—and shipping it yourself to your first readers—is pure magic.”



  
“The best marketing for your book is writing the next one—that’s the fiction game.”



  
“I used to chase whatever was interesting… now I’m building something I want to last 30 years.”



  
“Fiction lets me explore big ideas without pretending to be an expert.”



  
“The self-pub stigma is fading… especially when the book looks and reads like a trad pub hit.”



  
“Characters start doing things I didn’t plan—then I realize, oh, that’s why they’re here.”



  
“There’s no product in the world like a book—you can sell the same file for 50 years.”



  
“My dream is to have a warehouse full of books I wrote. That’s the romantic version of success.”</itunes:summary>

Here’s what we explored in the episode:

"The most important thing I learned was how to learn and unlearn... most people are never taught it. It is something that, almost by definition, you have to do yourself."

It’s important for leaders to admit when they are uncertain, and lead a culture of open-mindedness.

It’s important to adapt to new environments, not cling to outdated practices.

There’s an upcoming shift toward AI-driven, author-friendly publishing models that reduce inefficiencies and empower writers.

Jim predicts AI will allow a “tsunami of slop” content and open huge opportunities in curation.

In a world of abundant content, good taste and effective curation will be very profitable.

Jim shares his evolving views on Universal Basic Income (UBI), arguing for experimentation to address societal shifts caused by technological advancements.

Understanding opposing viewpoints to refine one's perspectives helps make better decisions. Jim uses AI to force him to debate and understand his own opinions better.

Jim credits his success to a lifelong commitment to curiosity, whether through broad reading or questioning established norms.

"Curiosity is a shit starter. It ignited my curiosity to the point where I just voraciously read everything."

Here’s what we explored in the episode:

How studying history helps us see the present and the future more clearly. 

Ben’s vision is to work with founders who are not just chasing profits but are driven by the desire to solve meaningful problems.

Most successful concepts emerge from multiple rounds of experimentation.

As institutions evolve, gaps formed around important research that used to be funded by universities or R&amp;D labs of corporations. Ben is building a non-profit to fill that gap. 

Ben shared why he chose to invest in startups rather than founding his own.

Ben invests in "physics-enabled" startups that apply scientific principles to solve tough problems.

For startups to be successful, there needs to be an alignment of motivations between investors and founders.

Founders should approach investors with clarity about their vision and expect honesty and support in return.

There are significant global issues that aren't being addressed by startups and opportunity abounds.

Leaders must build complementary teams where members fill each other’s gaps, particularly in technical and strategic expertise.

There’s a need for effective communication to bridge gaps between technical experts and the broader public. (hopefully some of what we’re doing here!) 

If you’re looking for non-profit causes for your philanthropic donations, SpecTech may be among the highest-leverage ways to advance human civilization through donations.

<li>How studying history helps us see the present and the future more clearly. </li>
<li>Ben’s vision is to work with founders who are not just chasing profits but are driven by the desire to solve meaningful problems.</li>
<li>Most successful concepts emerge from multiple rounds of experimentation.</li>
<li>As institutions evolve, gaps formed around important research that used to be funded by universities or R&amp;D labs of corporations. Ben is building a non-profit to fill that gap. </li>
<li>Ben shared why he chose to invest in startups rather than founding his own.</li>
<li>Ben invests in "physics-enabled" startups that apply scientific principles to solve tough problems.</li>
<li>For startups to be successful, there needs to be an alignment of motivations between investors and founders.</li>
<li>Founders should approach investors with clarity about their vision and expect honesty and support in return.</li>
<li>There are significant global issues that aren't being addressed by startups and opportunity abounds.</li>
<li>Leaders must build complementary teams where members fill each other’s gaps, particularly in technical and strategic expertise.</li>
<li>There’s a need for effective communication to bridge gaps between technical experts and the broader public. (hopefully some of what we’re doing here!) </li>
</ul><p>If you’re looking for non-profit causes for your philanthropic donations, SpecTech may be among the highest-leverage ways to advance human civilization through donations. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship</em></strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><em>There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business.

Here’s what we explored in the episode:

Inspired by projects like China’s Green Wall, Rainmaker aims to terraform deserts into lush, habitable landscapes.


Water scarcity can be solved by creating more water rather than just conserving to stay in the existing limits. 

There are already severely water-constrained communities and farms, especially in the American west and Southwest. 

Rainmaker’s cloud seeding program uses custom drones, radar, and safe, common chemical compounds. 

Cloud-seeding is decades-old tech. The breakthrough was a new radar to precisely measure the effectiveness of cloud-seeding efforts. 


China has more than 40,000 working on weather modification projects. The U.S. can catch up by supporting private sector innovation.

Rainmaker is actively recruiting passionate engineers ready to work on cutting-edge tech.

Being close to the frontier of innovation naturally drives the creation of new technologies and opportunities. Lots of examples inside Rainmaker. 

A commission in the book of Genesis in the Bible to steward the garden and take care of God’s creation is an intrinsic part of Rainmaker's purpose.


Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship
 
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
 
You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  
 
Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.</description>

Here’s what we explored in the episode:

Watching the moon landing as a child from East Germany inspired Klaus’ lifelong belief in the strength of human innovation.

Shifting from time management to energy management.

Finding your purpose is like "focusing a laser" that channels diffuse energy to achieve extraordinary results.

From observing professional tennis players, Klaus learned how mental toughness and micro-recharges help maintain peak performance.

Controlled breathing is a simple but powerful tool to manage emotions and maintain focus during high-pressure moments.

Klaus helped transform and restore purpose to Siemens’ struggling angiography division with the most impactful team meeting you can imagine. 

Aligning a team's work with a meaningful purpose motivates teams and improves long-term performance.

His book was born from a desire to share lessons with young leaders, his daughters, and others seeking balance and performance.

Creating memorable moments with his family helped Klaus maintain strong relationships despite a demanding career.

You can instill urgency and align teams by clearly communicating that a situation absolutely requires change.

Here’s what we explored in the episode:

We dive deep into the quirky history of the publishing industry, tracing it all the way back to the 1400s.

In the 19th century, authors could increase their earnings by co-investing in fixed costs, like print plates and bookbinding.

Traditional Publishing has always seen hardcovers as “the real books” and sought to protect them and their profits. 

Trade paperback was published only after a successful hardcover, with those rights often sold separately. 

Self-publishing changed the game for authors, with Amazon enabling print-on-demand and much higher royalty percentages.

If you are an author signing with a traditional publisher, realize YOU ARE NOT THE CUSTOMER–book retailers are their customers.


Lots of authors who earned big money retained their rights.


Stephen King retained his paperback rights an early successful book. After the hardcover version succeeded, he sold those rights for $400,000

Harper Lee made significant earnings from To Kill a Mockingbird by retaining movie adaptation rights.

Tom Clancy held on to his film and international rights. This later became highly lucrative as his popularity grew and more of his books got adaptations.

Traditional Publishers often prioritize prestige, tradition, and their profits – which doesn’t always align with author’s goals. 

Indie authors can now disregard tradition and experiment with pricing strategies to maximize reach, revenue, and their own personal results. 

 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship
 
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
 
You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  
 
Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. </description>

Important quotes from David Senra and Mitchell Baldridge:

"People don't see things as they are, we see them as we are. And so like we could write a book on this two-hour or whatever long conversation we've had and every single person's going to have a different perspective."
— David Senra

"I'm here to be the best in the world at what I'm doing. And then you get around other people like that. Like we just talked about Mike Ovitz. You think he was optimizing for days on the golf course?"
— David Senra

“I wake up every day more obsessed to the point where, like, if this continues, we're going to have to be concerned about me. And what I love is I'm really trying to go after it.”
— David Senra

"Books don't have to make money to make you money."
— Mitchell Baldridge

"Mute the world and build your own world and it's like part of building your own world you don't want to start from zero like a feral child in the middle of the woods."

Important quotes from Alex Komoroske:

"I think that to really wrestle with systems you have to let go and just dance with the system."
— Alex Komoroske

"I like the word gardening because it underlines that you are not in control of this system. You are influencing it."
— Alex Komoroske

"The builder gets immediately to work, but the gardener understands that other things can be alive."
— Alex Komoroske

"Technology should be about helping people create and use hand-tuned tools to extend their agency in collaborative ways."
— Alex Komoroske

"If people who are very unlike each other all find it interesting or intriguing, that's a good sign that it will spread out to be a very large audience."

Important quotes from Arkady Kulik:

"Good communication is essential to avoid conflicts and build better relationships, both personally and professionally."
— Arkady Kulik

"Aligning visions with founders is critical. It’s not just about the business, it’s about shared values and missions."
— Arkady Kulik

"The alliance between entrepreneurs and scientists is the key to unlocking humanity's transition to an advanced civilization."
— Arkady Kulik

"Technology is the only source of never-ending growth. Our ability to reshape what we have with a small amount of resources into something fantastic is a never-ending source of creativity."
— Arkady Kulik

"People who are not true to themselves and lie to themselves are not founder material. The people who don’t lie to themselves and know what they are trying to do are the ones who can actually get there."

Important quotes from Nathan Barry on building audience, wealth, and startups:

"If I look back at all the good things that have happened in my career in the last 3 years, they all come from writing. One little habit of writing 1,000 words a day revolutionized my career."
— Nathan Barry

"ATTENTION IS THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE"
— Nathan Barry

"When you start writing you don’t have to worry about crafting perfect prose. Instead you just need to focus on teaching useful skills."
— Nathan Barry

Making money is a skill—like playing the drums or piano—that you can get better at over time. 
I wouldn’t expect to be able to sit down at a piano for the first time and play a concerto. The same is true for making money. 
This is why most first companies fail.

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money:
 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
 
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
 
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
Important quotes from the podcast by Naval on Leverage:
 
“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” 
—Archimedes 
 
To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines. - Naval Ravikant
 
Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. - Naval Ravikant
 
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. - Naval Ravikant
 
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship
 
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
 
You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  
 
Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.</description>

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money:
 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
 
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
 
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
Important quotes from the podcast by Naval on Leverage:
 
“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” 
—Archimedes 
 
To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines. - Naval Ravikant
 
Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. - Naval Ravikant
 
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. - Naval Ravikant
 
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship
 
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
 
You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  
 
Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.</itunes:summary>

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money:
 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
 
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
 
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
Important quotes from the podcast by Naval on Leverage:
 
“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” 
—Archimedes 
 
To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines. - Naval Ravikant
 
Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. - Naval Ravikant
 
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. - Naval Ravikant
 
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship
 
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
 
You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  
 
Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. </itunes:summary>

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money:
 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
 
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
 
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant

Important quotes from the podcast by Naval on Leverage:
 
“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” 
—Archimedes 
 
To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines. - Naval Ravikant
 
Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. - Naval Ravikant
 
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. - Naval Ravikant
 
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Business and Entrepreneurship
 
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
 
You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.  
 
Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. </description>

(01:27:15) Where to get more of Andrew Cote


What’s Happening with Superconductors RIGHT NOW
Researchers have spent their entire careers researching room-temperature Superconductors. It’s one of the Holy Grails of material science. About a week ago, two papers were published simultaneously claiming a breakthrough – actual Room-Temperature Superconducting Materials, created in a lab in Korea.
There seems to be big drama between the scientists. A nobel prize may be at stake. Or even scientific immortality. It’s not the main story and there are many unconfirmed details, I won’t go into it here, but @8teAPi is basically live-tweeting an HBO series so follow them for that angle. 
We might be one week into a MASSIVE change in humanity, seeing the first ripples of a coming tidal wave. 
Now, RIGHT now, there are thousands of scientists all over the world working frantically to reprocuce these results, confirm theory, run simulations, and improve methodologies. It is INCREDIBLE to see the scientific base of humanity from all over the world rise as one and tackle this opportunity. Feel like a scene from a Michael Bay movie, but nerdier.
Here is what they’re working on…


Superconductors put simply
Superconductors are materials with zero electrical resistance. Normally, when energy moves between sources (an outlet to a phone battery), or over distance (through wires and power lines) there is loss of energy. Some estimates of that loss between generation and end user are 66%!! With zero resistance transmission materials, there could be near-zero loss of energy. Cost of energy could fall by one-third JUST by improving transmission. That would be great – and just the beginning.
I’m sure this description would make a Physics PhD cringe, but hey it’s my first week.
The problem is so far all of our superconductors only work at insanely cold temperatures. Those are complex and expensive to maintain, so superconductors have only been used very rarely in special circumstances to date.
Superconductors that work at room temperature would be an enormous breakthrough, making them less finnicky and cheaper to operate. We could put superconducting materials many more places like power lines, wires, computers, transportation, etc. 
Why is everyone SO DAMN EXCITED about the impact of room-temperature superconductors? So glad you asked…

Why It Matters
“If successful LK-99 would be a watershed moment for humanity easily on-par with invention of the transistor. Overnight, we revolutionize all of electronics and energy.”

What’s Happening with Superconductors RIGHT NOW
Researchers have spent their entire careers researching room-temperature Superconductors. It’s one of the Holy Grails of material science. About a week ago, two papers were published simultaneously claiming a breakthrough – actual Room-Temperature Superconducting Materials, created in a lab in Korea.
There seems to be big drama between the scientists. A nobel prize may be at stake. Or even scientific immortality. It’s not the main story and there are many unconfirmed details, I won’t go into it here, but @8teAPi is basically live-tweeting an HBO series so follow them for that angle. 
We might be one week into a MASSIVE change in humanity, seeing the first ripples of a coming tidal wave. 
Now, RIGHT now, there are thousands of scientists all over the world working frantically to reprocuce these results, confirm theory, run simulations, and improve methodologies. It is INCREDIBLE to see the scientific base of humanity from all over the world rise as one and tackle this opportunity. Feel like a scene from a Michael Bay movie, but nerdier.
Here is what they’re working on…


Superconductors put simply
Superconductors are materials with zero electrical resistance. Normally, when energy moves between sources (an outlet to a phone battery), or over distance (through wires and power lines) there is loss of energy. Some estimates of that loss between generation and end user are 66%!! With zero resistance transmission materials, there could be near-zero loss of energy. Cost of energy could fall by one-third JUST by improving transmission. That would be great – and just the beginning.
I’m sure this description would make a Physics PhD cringe, but hey it’s my first week.
The problem is so far all of our superconductors only work at insanely cold temperatures. Those are complex and expensive to maintain, so superconductors have only been used very rarely in special circumstances to date.
Superconductors that work at room temperature would be an enormous breakthrough, making them less finnicky and cheaper to operate. We could put superconducting materials many more places like power lines, wires, computers, transportation, etc. 
Why is everyone SO DAMN EXCITED about the impact of room-temperature superconductors? So glad you asked…

Why It Matters
“If successful LK-99 would be a watershed moment for humanity easily on-par with invention of the transistor. Overnight, we revolutionize all of electronics and energy.”

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money: 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. - Naval Ravikant 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy. - Naval Ravikant</description>

      <title>#028 Finding an edge in HR &amp; Culture for growing Startups, with Jeannine Seidl of Density</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/finding-an-edge-in-hr-culture-for-growing-startups-with-jeannine-seidl-of-density</link>
      <description> During this conversation on Jorgenson’s Soundbox, I have my beautiful and brilliant fiancé Jeannine on as my guest, and we talk about all things HR, now known as the People Function or People Team in many organizations. Currently, Jeannine is leading the People Team at the startup Density, which has grown from 40 employees to 180 in the last year and a half.
To start our discussion, I ask Jeannine to dispel some of the misperceptions of HR – she says often they are spending more time and energy fighting on behalf of employees. She also talks about the relationship between the CEO and the People Team and says she considers the CEO as a part of the People Team.
We transition to talking about recruiting and why Jeannine self-proclaims herself to be the world's worst recruiter as she shows candidates the underbelly of the company and paints a realistic landscape of what working for the company will really be like and the hurdles they may face. She elaborates on the different kinds of recruiting, and she highlights how the People Team changes as companies reach different milestones in growth.
Jeannine walks us through internal communications and some of the different systems she’s used, and she gives some examples of why people may seek out HR business partners for assistance. We talk about using Slack and whether it is a synchronous or asynchronous tool. She explains the necessary systems and processes and likens them to tree rings, with the HRIS (human resources information system) at the center, a ring for how the company gives and receives feedback, which we dive further into, and a third ring for things such as bonus programs and learning and development tools.
Towards the end of our conversation, we talk about why people leave companies as well as the difficulties of having to fire someone, and we discuss companies’ compensation philosophies. We also explore the reality of Flat Organizations and how transparency and clarity are the more important factors. Jeannine says that now companies are focusing more on creating better work-life balances and true wellness including physical, mental, and financial health. We wrap up with Jeannine’s learning journey and talk about building company culture.

      <title>#027 Finding the 100 highest-quality public businesses in the world with Will Oliver and Will Barnes, founders of In Practise</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/finding-the-100-highest-quality-public-businesses-in-the-world-with-will-oliver-and-will-barnes-founders-of-in-practise</link>
      <description>Will Barnes and Will Oliver are two fantastic individuals I met through Latticework and got to know by bonding over our fandom of Charlie Munger. They are the co-founders of In Practise, a company that conducts interviews with executives and sells them to investors looking at the companies and building conviction in their portfolio. They conduct one-to-one interviews in pursuit of finding the best investment opportunities for their clients. During our conversation, we talk about how they came to start their business, how it is structured to authentically align with themselves, and tactics they employ in conducting interviews.
To kick off the conversation, I ask about who their heroes are and both Wills talk about their fathers as well as Munger and Buffet, and then we transition into how they met and came to start In Practise. They both worked for Third Bridge, an expert network that connects mainly investment companies with operators in private one-to-one phone calls, and they came together to build the content side of the business. They fell in love with the work, and seeing a niche in the market for a more affordable solution for smaller hedge fund managers, they spun out from Third Bridge and formed In Practise.
We discuss how they are building a system to understand what quality means in a business and how they build conviction for investors. We talk a bit about Dee Hock, the founder and CEO of Visa, and how he has inspired and influenced In Practise. Their core offering is a library of interviews; they first aim to get their client up to speed quickly on the workings of the company they are interested in and then to delve into what really matters, and the next part is the analysis phase in which they offer investor dialogs about the company. Moreover, they are aiming to build a community for learning founded on trust.
We explore how they approach the interviews of executives and the balance between noticing patterns but also allowing the interview to go where it flows. They must understand the business and what the customers care about but also have to be willing to really listen. Will Barnes emphasizes the importance of the line of questioning rather than just the questions and says the epiphanies often come when the original hypothesis was wrong. They walk me through a couple of company examples, Naked Wine and Burford, and what really matters in them. To wrap up, I ask about the companies they can list that they believe to be in the hundred highest quality public businesses in the world today and about their project of In Practise 40 years out.

      <itunes:summary>Will Barnes and Will Oliver are two fantastic individuals I met through Latticework and got to know by bonding over our fandom of Charlie Munger. They are the co-founders of In Practise, a company that conducts interviews with executives and sells them to investors looking at the companies and building conviction in their portfolio. They conduct one-to-one interviews in pursuit of finding the best investment opportunities for their clients. During our conversation, we talk about how they came to start their business, how it is structured to authentically align with themselves, and tactics they employ in conducting interviews.
To kick off the conversation, I ask about who their heroes are and both Wills talk about their fathers as well as Munger and Buffet, and then we transition into how they met and came to start In Practise. They both worked for Third Bridge, an expert network that connects mainly investment companies with operators in private one-to-one phone calls, and they came together to build the content side of the business. They fell in love with the work, and seeing a niche in the market for a more affordable solution for smaller hedge fund managers, they spun out from Third Bridge and formed In Practise.
We discuss how they are building a system to understand what quality means in a business and how they build conviction for investors. We talk a bit about Dee Hock, the founder and CEO of Visa, and how he has inspired and influenced In Practise. Their core offering is a library of interviews; they first aim to get their client up to speed quickly on the workings of the company they are interested in and then to delve into what really matters, and the next part is the analysis phase in which they offer investor dialogs about the company. Moreover, they are aiming to build a community for learning founded on trust.

      <title>#026 Jason Hitchcock #2 w/ Four Moons: structuring a DeFi Fund, Liquid Staking &amp; How to get involved in Web3</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/jason-hitchcock-2-w-four-moons-structuring-a-defi-fund-liquid-staking-how-to-get-involved-in-web3</link>
      <description>This episode is a conversation about investing in the DeFi space with my previous podcast guest Jason Hitchcock and his partners of Four Moons Capital, Adam and Boz. They talk about how they all got together to form Four Moons and came to partner with Kingsley Capital to create a 100-million-dollar fund to be invested in DeFi. Throughout the conversation, we chat about some of their favorite tokens, projects, and ecosystems and how early it is in the space.
We talk about how they all keep up in the industry and decide what to pay attention to. Each team member has their own approach, but generally, the community you belong to can help inform you as well as following “thought leaders” on Twitter and Discord. Jason says he focuses on what will make money and tries to sort whether people are right about opportunities or if they are being duped. Adam shares a theme he’s adopted from the space, “We’re all gonna make it,” and says everyone is working to help grow the pie.
In the second half of the conversation, we talk about block explorers as the next Googles of the world, we explore the analogy of where crypto is at in comparison to where internet was in the 90s, and we talk about OpenSea as the Amazon of crypto and whether it will be disrupted or not. We also explore some thoughts on the metaverse and its opportunities. I then ask about some predictions for their fund in 10 years and am told they expect the fund to have several billion in proof stake tokens and that they’ll be able to take on other subadvisor arrangements with other types of treasuries.
To wrap up, we talk about some steps people can take if they want to learn more or get started in DeFi. Jason talks about building a portfolio to earn yield, which can then be sold to start building up a dream portfolio, or it can be compounded back into your strategy to earn more yield. Adam points out the common characteristic of successful crypto investors is resourcefulness and that it is a do-it-yourself industry. Boz suggests learning while earning; he says a first step is starting to yield on a stable coin, then learning through podcasts, Discords, Twitter, etc., and then the next phase is going from stable coin to a web3 interface and staking.

      <title>#025 Shane Mac: Building Messaging Protocol for Web3 (XMTP), Company Culture, and Scaling Trust</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/shane-mac-building-messaging-protocol-for-web3-xmtp-company-culture-and-scaling-trust-0</link>
      <description>In this episode of Jorgenson’s Soundbox, I continue exploring the world of web3 with my friend and former coworker Shane Mac. Shane is now the cofounder of XMTP, a decentralized and economic messaging protocol being built for web3. During our conversation, we talk about XMTP as a new protocol for building communication tools. We can spam-proof the next generation of the web! How Shane builds company culture to help him compete with world renowned companies and his personal and professional investing strategies.
To kick off our conversation, we talk a bit about Shane’s decision to move to Nashville, driven by the exhausting culture of work scale at all cost in San Francisco, and the music scene there. Shane then discusses how he came to work with Matt Galligan and start XMTP. When looking for an opportunity to build a new company, he had a lightbulb moment when Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound, presented a communication problem in the web3 space. Shane realized that people who have wallets want to be able to communicate with others that have wallets and to be able to prove ownership, and he recognized the potential for a new messaging communication protocol with the wallet as a means of sending and receiving messages. XMTP was thus founded as a decentralized messaging protocol with a universal backend that developers could build on top of and that we can all be owners of.
In the second half of the conversation, we explore Shane’s ability to create an awesome company culture. Shane says that while he can’t compete with renowned companies on having the most interesting idea, he can compete on culture. Shane aims to remove people’s anxieties so that they can be more productive. He does so by hiring personal assistants and coaches not only for executives but for everyone, removing the vesting cliff, and teaching people how to quit. We wrap up the conversation by talking about how Shane goes about investing. He says he focuses on what he knows well and believes in. Regarding crypto, he thinks of it as startup investing, and he has invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum and plans to hold for the long term. He also is the General Partner of the Logos Fund which invests similarly in startups, mostly focusing on the seed stage.

In the second half of the conversation, we explore Shane’s ability to create an awesome company culture. Shane says that while he can’t compete with renowned companies on having the most interesting idea, he can compete on culture. Shane aims to remove people’s anxieties so that they can be more productive. He does so by hiring personal assistants and coaches not only for executives but for everyone, removing the vesting cliff, and teaching people how to quit. We wrap up the conversation by talking about how Shane goes about investing. He says he focuses on what he knows well and believes in. Regarding crypto, he thinks of it as startup investing, and he has invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum and plans to hold for the long term. He also is the General Partner of the Logos Fund which invests similarly in startups, mostly focusing on the seed stage.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Jorgenson’s Soundbox, I continue exploring the world of web3 with my friend and former coworker Shane Mac. Shane is now the cofounder of XMTP, a decentralized and economic messaging protocol being built for web3. During our conversation, we talk about XMTP as a new protocol for building communication tools. We can spam-proof the next generation of the web! How Shane builds company culture to help him compete with world renowned companies and his personal and professional investing strategies.</p><p>To kick off our conversation, we talk a bit about Shane’s decision to move to Nashville, driven by the exhausting culture of work scale at all cost in San Francisco, and the music scene there. Shane then discusses how he came to work with Matt Galligan and start XMTP. When looking for an opportunity to build a new company, he had a lightbulb moment when Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound, presented a communication problem in the web3 space. Shane realized that people who have wallets want to be able to communicate with others that have wallets and to be able to prove ownership, and he recognized the potential for a new messaging communication protocol with the wallet as a means of sending and receiving messages. XMTP was thus founded as a decentralized messaging protocol with a universal backend that developers could build on top of and that we can all be owners of.</p><p>In the second half of the conversation, we explore Shane’s ability to create an awesome company culture.

      <title>#024 SquidDAO: Web3 Project Deep-Dive: Part Crypto Hedge Fund, Part NFT DAO. An Anonymous Conspiracy for Mutual Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/squiddao-web3-project-deep-dive-part-crypto-hedge-fund-part-nft-dao-an-anonymous-conspiracy-for-mutual-enrichment</link>
      <description>SquidDAO is an “Economic Flywheel denominated in Ethereum.” What does that mean? Good question, I wondered too. It’s basically a conspiracy amongst anonymous people on the internet to make money together. And anyone can join! I dug in with a few members to see what it’s all about. 
They sell NFTs, they issue tokens, they invest a treasury… they earn money! And they share it with token and NFT holders. 
This is my first pseudonymous podcast as well as the longest one I’ve ever done. In this episode, we explore a relatively new web3 project, Squid DAO, with a few guys I only know by their online handles. Squid DAO is described as an economic flywheel backed by Ethereum and is part company, part DeFi investment fund, and part NFT project. SQUID is currently trading for roughly the value of the assets it holds in the treasury, which could make it a great investment opportunity. Squid DAO is a great microcosm of the world of web3 as it is essentially a megatron of the various forks of web3 projects, which makes it a great learning opportunity.
We explore the economics of the DAO and why it is denominated in ETH rather than dollars. It can be valued via income derivative, the multiple on the treasury, or what it is trading at against what is on the balance sheet. Recently, a new governance proposal was passed making Squid and NFTs productive assets so that users may better run analyses. ETH is considered the best index and essentially operates like cash for the DAO. 
We wrap up the episode by talking about how to learn more and get involved. Squid DAO’s Twitter and Discord are great ways to learn more, but the best way to gain mastery is by investing your own money. If looking to get involved, you can help with whatever skills you have to offer, be it marketing, as a developer, a degen or coding strategist, or someone with a web2 background.

      <title>#023 Tim Hwang: Trade Journal Cooperative, Robot Lawyers, Bubble in Digital Ads, Zuck Being Quantitatively Weird, and Misinformation as Warfare</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/tim-hwang-trade-journal-cooperative-robot-lawyers-bubble-in-digital-ads-zuck-being-quantitatively-weird-and-misinformation-as-warfare</link>
      <description>Tim Hwang is the most interesting man on the internet. He runs a project called the Trade Journal Cooperative, which I've subscribed to for years. We talk about how the Trade Journal Cooperative got started it, how Tim *secretly* went to law school, and several other projects Tim is working on including an academic journal dedicated to bizarre images of Mark Zuckerberg. Thought that was all? That’s not all. Also using bots to wage information wars on social media, and Tim’s book which predicts an online advertising bubble. My favorite thing about Tim is his ability to sit on the fence between very serious and very whimsical.
To start our conversation, Tim talks off the cuff about one of his heroes, Charles Fort, who compiled books of anomalous phenomena and is the source of the term “Fortean.” This explains a lot about Tim. We then explore Tim’s role as a trade journal sommelier and the Trade Journal Cooperative which provides a quarterly exploration of various industries. We talk a bit about the vastness of the trucking industry and also about the elevator, i.e., vertical transportation, industry.
Tim also tells us the awkward story of how he somewhat unintentionally ended up going to law school secretly, and we explore some of the projects he started after graduating, including Rosen, Wolfe and Hwang, a boutique law practice that specializes in serving the unique needs of independent creators and small to midsize technology businesses, and Robot, Robot &amp; Hwang, which was created off the notion of creating a fully automated law firm. Among other projects, Tim also started the academic journal The California Review of Images and Mark Zuckerberg, which explores why Zuckerberg seems to be exceptionally good at ending up in strange images and what that says about the media and culture. 
I ask Tim to talk about his 2019 paper titled “Maneuver and Manipulation: On the Military Strategy of Online Information Warfare,” which is about how bots shape discussions online and the possible strategies of combating public manipulation. We also talk about a couple of branches off the information warfare piece, the National Conspiracy Writing Month (NaCoWriMo), in which participants complete a “daunting, but straightforward challenge to develop a deep, viable and complete conspiracy theory during the 30 days of November,” and COGSEC, which is a conference on the real-world practice of countering online influence operations. We wrap up our discussion talking about Tim’s recently published book The Subprime Attention Crisis that explores the bubble of online advertising and its potential implications on web2 giants.

We wrap up our discussion talking about Tim’s recently published book <em>The Subprime Attention Crisis</em> that explores the bubble of online advertising and its potential implications on web2 giants.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Links: </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Books-Charles-Fort-Talents/dp/0486230945"> Charles Fort Books</a></p><p><a href="https://www.tradejournalcooperative.com/">The Trade Journal Cooperative</a></p><p><a href="https://ironcladapp.com/lp/flexible-contract-management-software/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Brand&amp;utm_content=ironclad%20(mb)&amp;_bt=515864995126&amp;_bk=%2Bironclad&amp;_bm=b&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=110075702055"> Iron Clad Contract Management</a> </p><p><a href="https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/3694.pdf"> Maneuver and Manipulation: On the Military Strategy of Online Information Warfare</a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subprime-Attention-Crisis-Advertising-Originals/dp/0374538654/ref=asc_df_0374538654/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=459617407428&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15095696725273520563&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9027255&amp;hvtargid=pla-943674156415&amp;psc=1"> Sub-prime attention crisis by Tim Hwang</a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Everything-New-History-Humanity/dp/0374157359/ref=asc_df_0374157359/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=475746469136&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=838120870960575074&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9027255&amp;hvtargid=pla-1158511633804&amp;psc=1"> The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber</a></p><p><a href="https://timhwang.org/">TimHwang.org</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/timhwang">Tim on Twitter</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional Episodes If You Enjoyed:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.ejorgenson.com/podcast/sean-oconnor-how-blockchain-is-changing-society-with-costless-transactions"> Sean O’Connor: How Blockchain is Changing Society with Costless Transactions</a></p><p><br></p><p>If you want to support the podcast, here are a few ways you can: </p><p>&gt;&gt; Buy a copy of the Navalmanak: <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/">www.navalmanack.com/</a> </p><p>&gt;&gt; Share the podcast with your friends and on social media </p><p>&gt;&gt; Give the podcast a positive review to help us reach new listeners </p><p>&gt;&gt; Make a weekly, monthly, or one-time donation: <a href="https://app.omella.com/o/9Bufa">https://app.omella.com/o/9Bufa</a> </p><p>&gt;&gt; Follow me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ericjorgenson">@ericjorgenson</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; Learn more and sign up for the “Building a Mountain of Levers” course and community: <a href="https://www.ejorgenson.com/leverage">https://www.ejorgenson.com/leverage</a> </p><p>I appreciate your support! </p>]]>

      <title>#022 Solocast #2 - Web3 by a Winter Fire</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/solocast-2-web3-by-a-winter-fire</link>
      <description>This week’s podcast is my second SoloCast, and during the episode, I share my thoughts and some predictions on the potential impacts and implementations of web3. The blockchain can be basically defined as a cryptographic breakthrough that allows for openness but with very careful editing permissions. While web1 resulted in costless publication and web2 in costless communication, web3 allows for costless transactions. This will likely increase the number of transactions we make. Web3 can also create cheap digital scarcity which may help authenticate originality in the digital world.
Why does this all matter? My answer to this question regards the implications of web3 on the cost of trust and decentralization. Currently, the cost of trust in the market is relatively high, and with increasing transactions and original creations occurring via the blockchain, we will have to pay less for trust. Also, there will be less need for centralized parties such as brands or centralized banks, though it’s too early to say which authorities will all be affected.
Next, I make some predictions about what will happen as the blockchain gets deployed. The first to be impacted is the management of digital items, with finance and gaming among the earlier industries. Also, we will likely see digital components getting separated from analog components so that they can be managed on the blockchain. Another trend that may happen is that the blockchain may be implemented to manage atoms in the real world.
To wrap up the SoloCast, I explore the implications of web3. It will probably impact managerial culture, and DAOs (distributed autonomous organizations) will likely take over some market share from companies. I also believe the biggest networks will be bigger than the biggest companies, in part because there is no cap on involvement in web3 networks and ecosystems.
My goal in sharing my thoughts is not just to tell you what I think will happen but to provide some notions and rough directions so that you can hopefully overlay some of these lessons into your own experience and expertise. Web3 is still not easy to navigate, and it is still early in its implementation, but it provides incredible opportunity, and it is fun to get involved.

      <title>#021 Track Zach Marshall #2: Focusing on customers, building MVPs, and creating trust as a new startup.</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/track-zach-marshall-2-focusing-on-customers-building-mvps-and-creating-trust-as-a-new-startup</link>
      <description>Welcome to the second episode of Track Zach, a series of quarterly podcast episodes in which we will be following Zach’s journey as he starts and scales his private security marketplace, Conterra. We will check in on how the previous goals Zach set are going, hear about what he’s learned and how he’s pivoted, and see what he is looking to accomplish in the next quarter in the huge, fragmented, and heavily middle-manned $50 billion industry of private security. 
This quarter, Zach’s target was at least ten customers, 300 professionals to sign up on the supply side, and a new website launched by October 1st. His original thesis was to collect the supply side of the marketplace first. The website ended taking up longer than expected, which made him think he’s building the wrong thing. Zach stopped pushing for signups and though he didn’t get 300, there was a ton of word of mouth and recommendations going around. Zach was “collecting no’s” the second-best thing to yesses, and from the no’s, he was able to listen to what customers want, learn from that, and alter how they go to market. 
He highlights that one of the main issues in the security industry is a lack of trust amongst providers/security professionals and a fear of being taken advantage of. With this, he found collecting demand to be proving to be more difficult, while the supply side is coming easier, prompting him to alter his original thesis and focus more on the demand side. 
With all these observations, Zach says he gained clarity, and now things are starting to come together. He intends to focus the business on being the connective tissue and reputation for the major players in the space, and by doing so, they can cut out the major middlemen and reallocate that cash to those in the industry that should really have it. He is also shifting expectations and being clearer on focusing in on the things that will impact the business in a greater and faster way rather than the things that won’t have as much impact, and he is getting better at vetting and hiring. 
Zach explained his new technical roadmap as a process that starts with building a wheel, then a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bicycle, then a motorcycle, then a car. He explains that at this point, they have built skateboards.
During the next quarter, Zach expects to be neck-deep in fundraising and finding the right partners, and he is aiming to be confident in knowing the right amount of capital he’ll need. He predicts the team will look a little different as he continues to recruit for an operations person. For the next 90 to 180 days, he will be mainly focused on operations, and he hopes to learn exactly what a world-class security recruiting company looks like.

      <title>#020 Chris Powers: Starting A Real Estate Empire at 17, Focus, Podcast Flywheels</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/chris-powers-starting-a-real-estate-empire-at-17-focus-podcast-flywheels</link>
      <description>In the last episode, we discussed alternative assets, and in this episode, we take a deep dive into the career of Chris Powers, the master of one specific alternative asset: real estate. Chris began his real estate career when he was just 17 years old and has spent the last 17 years building Fort Capital, a real estate firm in Fort Worth, Texas. Chris was a hungry 17-year-old, just showed up at college, bought his first house with no money down in 2004. By the time he left college, he had 12 houses. Fast forward to 2021, just this year, along with investors, they purchased $500 million of industrial real estate in Texas. Throughout the episode, we discuss Chris’s journey in real estate, investing, recruiting, and podcasting.
We started the conversation by asking Chris who his heroes are. He shared the story of his father who went back to college to pursue medicine even after being a lawyer for 13 years. His dad taught him the valuable lessons that you only live one life and that money can only make you so happy.
Chris bought his first house at 17 when he was starting college and got into real estate as a means to make money during his studies. He was driven by constantly waking up and feeling behind and wanting to do something. Before graduating, he bought more student housing, started a property management business, and started a leasing business. He graduated in 2008, during the economic collapse, and had no choice but to continue in real estate.
From 2010 to 2015, Chris was doing a bit of everything related to real estate – he was building custom homes and spec homes, buying land, VC investing, and had a small team that he managed. Despite having some success, he realized he wasn’t compounding his business the way he wanted. Reading Good to Great by Jim Collins motivated him to narrow the focus of his business.
Chris talks about his need to be able to recruit and the importance of having a mission. We also discuss how flywheels can propel us forward, and for Chris, his flywheel is based on his podcast, Twitter, real estate business, and investors that create a virtuous cycle of growth.
Recently, Chris has transitioned out of being the CEO of Fort Capital, and he is learning how to be an owner. He is also focusing on his VC Funds and building Powers Capital, which he says will function like a family office but also will function like private equity. We wrap up the conversation discussing when enough is enough and measuring impact; Chris says he’s no longer in it for the money but rather to see what it is possible to accomplish during the one life he has.

      <title>#019 Phil Huber: Crazy Alternative Assets, Crypto for Financial Advisors &amp; the Book Writing</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/phil-huber-crazy-alternative-assets-crypto-for-financial-advisors-the-book-writing</link>
      <description>In this week’s episode, I talk with Phil Huber, the Chief Investment Officer at Savant Wealth Management and author of the new book The Allocator’s Edge. This episode does not include financial advice.* Rather, we talk about the advice Phil gives other people about their finances and the book he wrote about financial advice.
We begin the episode with a discussion about financial advising and what goes into becoming a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) and a CFP (Certified Financial Planner). We also talk about how it’s important to find the right financial advisor as a person’s financial life becomes more complex. I ask Phil if any of his clients ever ask if he can YOLO them so hard with investing, and he discusses advisors’ business of growing and preserving wealth responsibly.
Phil’s new book focuses on alternative investments, and he gave us a glimpse of what those investments are. He demonstrates how diversifying clients’ portfolios help manage risk. Phil explains catastrophe reinsurance, and we discuss the recent proliferation of alternative investing apps and platforms and how barriers are being broken down to previously inaccessible asset classes for average investors.  
Any conversation involving alternative investments would in one way or another, end up with crypto. Phil talks about how advisors are trying to navigate crypto and the current difficulties of incorporating it into clients’ investment portfolios as well as possibilities for its inclusion in the future.
We end the episode talking about the process of writing a book and how it differs from blogging. Phil wrote The Allocator’s Edge for himself ten years ago. By reading his book, Phil believes that investors can become more comfortable discussing and using alternative assets.

      <title>#018 Bram Kanstein: Effing around on the internet - MicroStartups, Crypto/NFT’s &amp; Course Building.</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/bram-kanstein-effing-around-on-the-internet-microstartups-cryptonfts-course-building</link>
      <description>Bram Kanstein has become a professional at fucking around on the internet. He has built dozens of products, three of which he successfully sold, and he previously spent time working for a VC and Product Hunt.
We dive right into talking about Startup Stash, which is listed as the number one product on Product Hunt. Startup Stash is described as a curated directory of resources and tools for startups. Two years after launching and going viral, he sold the micro product for Ethereum. He also discusses the first company he sold, roadtoscale.com, and says that both products’ success came from delivering value to the right audience.
Bram talks about how he discovered and fell in love with Product Hunt, which became the tool for his hobby of curating and discovering new startups. He loved Product Hunt so much that he joined the company a short few weeks after launching Startup Stash.
Bram got involved crypto when he was still a student and learned through experience. He recounts a funny crypto story of creating an account in the game, Second Life just to buy some BTC. After day trading for a period around 2013, he sold his Bitcoin and forgot about crypto for a while. In 2017, he discovered Ethereum and got back into crypto. Recently, Bram launched an NFT collection based on a color alphabet.
Currently, Bram is consulting a large company on innovation practices and validating new ideas. He is also teaching an online course, No Code MVP, and is working on his new idea, seedrounds.eu, which is aimed at improving deal flow for investors. The main TLDR he wants to share with everyone is, “fucking around the internet can pay off.”

      <title>#017 Chris Sparks: High-stakes Poker, the training regimen of a world-class mental athlete, and coaching the top 0.01%</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/chris-sparks-high-stakes-poker-in-private-celebrity-games-the-training-regimen-of-a-world-class-mental-athlete-and-coaching-the-top-001</link>
      <description>Chris says he isn’t the best poker player in the world, but he may be the most profitable. 
Pro poker player Chris Sparks is training for the highest-stakes tournament he has ever played in after a long sabbatical. He says he has already decided he is going to win, and now he is doing the necessary things to create that outcome.
What is the dynamic amongst poker friends? Chris says “frenemies” – all bets are off when the cards are on the table. Chris only plays when he expects to make money, and elaborates on the role of recreational players, stating that if you can’t recognize the fish at the poker table, you are the fish.
In the poker world, the meta skill of finding good games, of getting invited, and staying invited are critical. A good example is how Chris got invited to a famous comedian’s poker parties multiple times. Chris recounts these parties that feature full sets of dealers, cocktail waitresses, and masseuses--and it all ends when the comedian gets tired.
We talk about Chris’s consulting agency, Forcing Function, travel, and living with one of the world’s best pianists. Currently, Chris is coming out of a sabbatical and is preparing to play his largest tournament to date, with the prize pool potentially reaching seven figures. 
For Chris, everything is a bet. But with any bet, the decision should be weighed with the things surrounding it and you go in with eyes wide open.

      <title>#016 Kevin Espiritu: Bootstrapping Epic Gardening to 8 figures by mixing Media + D2C Biz models. Oh and Poker, Pink Pineapples, and Male Models</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/kevin-espiritu-bootstrapping-epic-gardening-to-10-figures-by-mixing-media-d2c-biz-models-oh-and-poker-pink-pineapples-and-male-models</link>
      <description>This week’s guest is my friend, Kevin Espiritu. Kevin is the founder of Epic Gardening, the world’s biggest gardening education platform. We became good friends over the internet--Kevin and I talked about the trend of parasocial relationships and how you can get to know someone despite having little to no in-person interaction.
We talked about how Kevin transitioned from making a living out of playing poker, to building websites, to marketing and blogging, and finally, working full-time on Epic Gardening. This project went on to garner the biggest gardening audiences on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram and has branched into direct-to-consumer business without any ad spend.
Kevin relates his mistake in scaling the company revenue faster than he built the team, saying he likely left growth on the table. Leveraging people was a challenge at first. He says he thinks of himself more as a content creator and not really as a writer or YouTuber or podcaster, which eventually helped ease the process of trusting new team members to take on such responsibilities as he grew the company.
Kevin is now raising PE money and making an acquisition as an independent entrepreneur. We’ve had such a wonderful conversation that goes beyond Epic Gardening and into fun stuff like how creators can implement web3 tools, Kevin's short career as a male model, pink pineapple piracy, and so much more.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s guest is my friend, Kevin Espiritu. Kevin is the founder of Epic Gardening, the world’s biggest gardening education platform. We became good friends over the internet--Kevin and I talked about the trend of parasocial relationships and how you can get to know someone despite having little to no in-person interaction.
We talked about how Kevin transitioned from making a living out of playing poker, to building websites, to marketing and blogging, and finally, working full-time on Epic Gardening. This project went on to garner the biggest gardening audiences on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram and has branched into direct-to-consumer business without any ad spend.
Kevin relates his mistake in scaling the company revenue faster than he built the team, saying he likely left growth on the table. Leveraging people was a challenge at first. He says he thinks of himself more as a content creator and not really as a writer or YouTuber or podcaster, which eventually helped ease the process of trusting new team members to take on such responsibilities as he grew the company.
Kevin is now raising PE money and making an acquisition as an independent entrepreneur. We’ve had such a wonderful conversation that goes beyond Epic Gardening and into fun stuff like how creators can implement web3 tools, Kevin's short career as a male model, pink pineapple piracy, and so much more.

      <title>#015 David Perell: Intellectual Openness, Mental Models for Success, and Peculiar Ways of Looking at The World</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/david-perell-intellectual-openness-mental-models-for-success-and-peculiar-ways-of-looking-at-the-world</link>
      <description>This week’s guest is David Perell. David is a creator, a writer, and a teacher at his massively successful online writing course, called Write of Passage. The success of his course gave me inspiration for my own course, and gives me fundamental optimism about the future of education. David and I have been friends for years, so this is less of an interview and more of a one-sided hang-session, where I get the pleasure of drawing out new ideas and experiences from David that I haven’t heard before. This is… basically what it’s like to hang out with us in person, and I’ll let you decide if that’s a good thing or not :). David is a man of endless-energy. He is reference-rife and story-stacked. I always have a great time talking with David, and I welcome you to join the conversation. 
As always, additional resources to enrich your experience below:
 
Topics Covered: 

The upcoming Porter Robinson documentary that David is working on. 

How David applied the ideas of Peter Thiel to… everything in life

How to learn writing the fun way (less grammar more jammin) 

Mental models for building successful products and companies

What it means for something to “move” us

The most interesting modern art form of today

What deliberate consumption looks like

      <title>#014 Dan Reecer: What Is Polkadot And Why It’s The Future of Web3</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/dan-reecer-what-is-polkadot-and-why-its-the-future-of-web3</link>
      <description>Today, my guest is Dan Reecer. Dan joined the crypto world 3 years ago instead of going to get his MBA, and is now VP of Growth for Acala, the Defi Network launching soon on the Polkadot Blockchain Platform. Don’t worry, all of those words get explained in the podcast. 
In this conversation, I try to bring us all (myself included) from basics to applications of blockchain, and help us all see around the next few corners we’ll all go through together over the next decade. We talk about: Dan’s path to working in crypto, what Polkadot is, where it came from, why it’s different from Bitcoin and Ethereum, and how crypto will benefit people not already in the space.
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
(I encourage you to go play around with some of these tools and technologies. Things start to click when you actually use them and feel them work.) 
 
Topics Covered: 

What is Polkadot?

Where Polkadot came from and why it’s different from Bitcoin and Ethereum

What does a multi-chain future look like?

Why do we need that? What problems does Polkadot solve?

What is Acala? 

How crypto will benefit normal people

      <title>#013 Cliff Kuang: Optimizing User Interface And The Massive Opportunities Within Design</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/cliff-kuang-optimizing-user-interface-and-the-massive-opportunities-within-design</link>
      <description>Today my guest is Cliff Kuang, author of a fantastic book called User Friendly: How The Hidden Rules of Design are Reshaping The Way We Live, Work, and Play, which was called a "tour de force" by the New York Times. He was the Design editor of Fast Company, and Editor at Wired Magazine. From there he went on to work at Google as a Senior Staff Designer on an innovations team. Cliff is obsessive about the deepest challenges facing UX design today such as the metaphors that undergird what we do, the future of digital ecosystems, and the future experiences those ecosystems can unlock. Enjoy these topics and many more on this episode of Jorgenson’s Soundbox!
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
Topics Covered: 

What Cliff is doing to change the entire landscape of user interface

What a unicorn is within the design industry and why they’re a dying breed

The universal problem of design

What is “good” design

How metaphor and feedback are at the core of user interface

How design is empathetic

Why we are in the ever-present of user interface

      <title>#012 Mitchell Baldridge: Defeating Taxes, Financial Planning, and Flipping A Bored Ape NFT for $250k</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/mitchell-baldridge-defeating-taxes-financial-planning-and-flipping-a-bored-ape-nft-for-250k-0</link>
      <description>Mitchell Baldridge is an accountant and financial planner who also identifies as a libertarian anarchist crypto-degenerate. We talk through the creation of his firm, everything financial planning entails, and how he flipped a Bored Ape NFT for $250k. A little something for everyone today! Mitchell can’t be everyone’s personal planner and accountant, (though he is mine and I’m very grateful for that!) but he offers expertise that can help anyone. Taxes are likely your single largest expense over your entire life, so it pays to understand them.
Be sure to  tweet or email me so I know what you think of the episode, and be well!
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
 Topics Covered: 

Crypto plays in the public markets

Wealth-building and preservation strategies

101 resources for people who want to self-educate on financial planning and taxes

How web3 could affect accounting and tax over a 20-year time horizon?

Mitchell’s business specifically

What is the path and what do you learn to become a CFP and accountant

When should someone start working with a CFP or accountant?

How do you know if you have a good accountant? A good financial planner?

      <title>#011 Eric Jorgenson: Metagames, Feedback Loops and Transcending The Muggle World</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/eric-jorgenson-metagames-feedback-loops-and-transcending-the-muggle-world</link>
      <description>Just me and you today, dear listener -- and I’m going to talk through some ideas that have been fascinating me recently, weaving together authors like Rory Sutherland, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Nassim Taleb. As I reviewed my highlights from books, blogs and articles that I’ve been collecting over the past 10 years the main ideas that jumped out at me are playing the metagame and feedback loops. Both of these are ways to transcend the muggle world and start playing a different game. 
I hope you enjoy this format -- if you love it (or hate it, actually), please tweet or email me so I know whether to ever do this again. It’s all part of the sandbox experience! 
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
Topics Covered: 

What are Metagames

How Metagames change the game and allow you to dominate

What are feedback loops

Why we accept false barriers to cushion our egos

Places to intervene in a system

The power of transcending paradigms

How a system can be destroyed by ignoring feedback

How to expand your theoretical fish tank

 
Favorite Quotes:
“In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.” -fs.blog
“Play the metagame in your domain too, whether you’re head of an organization or just starting out. Blowout the walls of your fish tank and transcend paradigms.” - Eric Jorgenson
“False barriers are accepted because they are the path of least resistance for the ego” -Eric Jorgenson

      <itunes:summary>Just me and you today, dear listener -- and I’m going to talk through some ideas that have been fascinating me recently, weaving together authors like Rory Sutherland, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Nassim Taleb. As I reviewed my highlights from books, blogs and articles that I’ve been collecting over the past 10 years the main ideas that jumped out at me are playing the metagame and feedback loops. Both of these are ways to transcend the muggle world and start playing a different game. 
I hope you enjoy this format -- if you love it (or hate it, actually), please tweet or email me so I know whether to ever do this again. It’s all part of the sandbox experience! 
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
Topics Covered: 

What are Metagames

How Metagames change the game and allow you to dominate

What are feedback loops

Why we accept false barriers to cushion our egos

Places to intervene in a system

The power of transcending paradigms

How a system can be destroyed by ignoring feedback

How to expand your theoretical fish tank

 
Favorite Quotes:
“In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.” -fs.blog
“Play the metagame in your domain too, whether you’re head of an organization or just starting out. Blowout the walls of your fish tank and transcend paradigms.” - Eric Jorgenson
“False barriers are accepted because they are the path of least resistance for the ego” -Eric Jorgenson

      <title>#010 Codie Sanchez: Learning Leverage From Drug Cartels, Vanguard, And Goldman Sachs</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/codie-sanchez-learning-leverage-from-drug-cartels-vanguard-and-goldman-sachs</link>
      <description>Codie Sanchez has been a journalist embedded with cartels, worked fancy-pants finance jobs at Goldman Sachs and Vanguard, and now -- she is an independent investor and entrepreneur.
She owns a direct interest in FORTY FIVE businesses, with more than 25 cash flows. Codie’s interests include boring businesses (like laundromats and property managers), online media companies, and service businesses.
You’ll hear us drop “leverage” a few times in this interview, and though it wasn’t what I’d planned on talking about, I think Codie is a living example of the power of methodically applying leverage. If you want to build an independent career like Codie’s, you’ll love my course+community, called Building a Mountain of Leverage. Check it out at EJorgenson.com/Leverage
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
 
Topics Covered: 

Putting money to work. (Angel Investing, Permanent Equity, Real Estate, and Stocks.)

Leverage: The art of increasing your outcomes (tools, product, people, and capital.)

How Codie keeps track of 45 different revenue streams

What you can learn from cartels and spec ops organizations

The universal language

Why EQ is a better indicator for financial success than IQ

How to create your own mentor

How to build “free” equity

How to withstand more than one bullet


Favorite Quotes:
“Civilize the mind, make savage the body, grow the revenue sheet” -Codie Sanchez
“Money is just a tool. The more tools I have the more ability I have to construct the world I want and the world that I think is best for all and for me and for the people that are around me.” -Codie Sanchez
“I think plans are normally for fairy tales. I truly believe that if people can follow their curiosity they're gonna end up exactly where they're supposed to be. The only thing you should be focused on is what is interesting to you, what you can get lost in.” -Codie Sanchez

      <title>#009 Track Zach Marshall Vol 1: From Navy SEAL To Marketplace Founder -- Future of Private Security</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/tracking-zach-marshall-vol-1-transitioning-from-the-navy-seals-to-starting-the-future-of-private-security</link>
      <description>Today, we’re kicking off a new long-term segment, called Track Zach -- my buddy Zach Marshall just founded a company called Conterra, and is about 3 months into the journey. I plan to have a conversation with him every 3 months or so to get a real-time, much more honest, interesting look at startup life. Zach, now in his second career after the Navy SEALs, is setting his considerable will against a new challenge -- starting a venture-backed company to fix today’s outdated, broken system for hiring private security around the world. Enjoy the ride!
If you’re not on my email list, fix that asap by going to ejorgenson.com -- I share weekly blog posts, podcast highlights, and new exciting new projects! 
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:

Topics Covered: 

What drives someone to become a Navy SEAL

What is private security?

Conterra: the private security marketplace

How Conterra is going to revolutionize a $50 billion dollar industry labor marketplace for private security industry

The current state of Conterra and where it’s going


Favorite Quotes:
“In the military you have to learn things extremely fast and not just to pass a test, now you are responsible for these things. For example a skydiver in charge of a civilian drop in a stadium is coordinating all sorts of things and he has 10,000, maybe 5,000 jumps. Meanwhile I had to do the same thing in the service and I had around 65 jumps.” - Zach
 
“In the military you’re just given this massive amount of responsibility so you have to actually pay attention to every detail. Attention to detail is one of those phrases said thousands and thousands of times in the spec ops community and it really is true.” - Zach

Favorite Quotes:
“In the military you have to learn things extremely fast and not just to pass a test, now you are responsible for these things. For example a skydiver in charge of a civilian drop in a stadium is coordinating all sorts of things and he has 10,000, maybe 5,000 jumps. Meanwhile I had to do the same thing in the service and I had around 65 jumps.” - Zach
 
“In the military you’re just given this massive amount of responsibility so you have to actually pay attention to every detail. Attention to detail is one of those phrases said thousands and thousands of times in the spec ops community and it really is true.” - Zach

        <![CDATA[<p>Today, we’re kicking off a new long-term segment, called Track Zach -- my buddy Zach Marshall just founded a company called Conterra, and is about 3 months into the journey. I plan to have a conversation with him every 3 months or so to get a real-time, much more honest, interesting look at startup life. Zach, now in his second career after the Navy SEALs, is setting his considerable will against a new challenge -- starting a venture-backed company to fix today’s outdated, broken system for hiring private security around the world.

      <title>#008 Andrew Finn of G64 Ventures &amp; Wait But Why: How To Acquire A Free Company And Knowing When To Eat A Shitburger</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/andrew-finn-of-waitbutwhy-how-to-acquire-a-free-company-and-knowing-when-to-eat-a-shitburger</link>
      <description>Today, I’m talking with my new Capital Camp buddy Andrew Finn. He is the co-founder of the blog Wait But Why. Since age 25 he’s been patiently building, buying, and operating small businesses. Now, he and Tim Urban share a portfolio of cash-flowing small businesses. Together we discuss how to get a free company, why it is often easier to buy a company than build it, and when to eat a shitburger. Enjoy these topics and countless others on this episode of Jorgenson’s Soundbox. 
Additional resources to help enrich your experience below:
Topics Covered: 

How to get a “free” business

What a $100,000 failure in early stage podcasting looked like

Why it’s easier to buy a company than build a company

Why “doing it later” is a risk and the opportunity cost that comes with it

The importance of judgement and getting experience making ‘real decisions’

How to be a legitimate player in “the game”

An illustration of a jobless renegade pirate’s day looks like

Eating shitburgers, and how to know when to stop

 
Favorite Quotes:
“If I do all this maneuvering, find this company, sell at this price, sell some debt and get some money. In 5 years it’ll be like poof here’s a free company and I get my money back.” - Andrew Finn
 
“Your job is not to win the SMB game, it’s to win the game. It’s to win the game of money in a way that will benefit your life. Like, we’re invested in crypto, and the stock market too.”
 
“All service businesses are chicken, just as much as software. You pay someone  $X. Resell their time for  $X +  $Y. And the entirety of the business is justifying and expanding Y to both customers and workers. Y comes from well managed opex, capex, and organization structure. To do it well, you have to just laser focus on what you're providing in exchange for Y. The market gets pissed long-term if it doesn't feel like you're providing enough, and every day it conspires to ask you the question.” - Andrew’s Twitter

      <title>#004 Jason Hitchcock: DeFi, NFTs, And The Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/jason-hitchcock-defi-nfts-and-the-metaverse</link>
      <description>On this episode I welcome Jason Hitchcock, crypto sensei and Principal at To The Moon Capital. Jason (Twitter: @JasonHitchcock) was among the few to be early to Ethereum, Helium, CryptoPunks, Alchemix, and more. He has 12 years of early stage startup experience and previously held a role at Twitch and Bebo. Listen as we explore DeFi, NFTs, intermediate wealth building, the Metaverse and much more. If you are new to the space I wanted to provide a quick glossary of terms and phrases that you might not be familiar with. Check it out here:
Crypto Glossary:
 $ETH - I don’t own any Bitcoin. Bullish on Eth becoming the iOS of crypto. The next few months will be wild as miners are zeroed out, fees get burned, and staked eth yields go up. You cannot own enough eth. Setting up a validator is the easiest path to non trivial passive income
 $Luna - user friendly Defi gov token that gets more valuable as more  $UST is minted 
 $ALCX - self paying loans. ALCX will earn 10% of protocol fees in v2, and grow along with stablecoin demand
 $HNT - decentralized cellular network with parabolic growth
 $AKT - A decentralized version of AWS compute. Users pay bills with AKT and fees go to stakers at 56% apy 
 $ATOM- the gov token for the blockchain-in-a-box. Earns fees with every cross-chain transaction on IBC, the standard for interoperability.
 $crv and  $CVX: stake these to earn crazy yield from stablecoin swaps on Curve. 
 $RUNE: cross chain liquidity of native assets. This will truly bring Bitcoin to defi. Insanely hard problem to solve is solved. 
 $OGN - Shopify for NFT drops. OGN is making big deals, pay attention
 $MATIC - first mover of the L2s has already inhaled billions on liquidity, and launches major integrations every day. 
 $SUSHI - not just an exchange; but offering a full suite of smart contract templates for projects to launch their token economy. And it earns fees when staked
 $AAVE - the perpetually undervalued lending platform that has an ocean of liquidity.
$ETH2x-FLI a token that gives exposure to a perfectly executed 2x leverage strategy on Eth. When eth is up, this goes up double. No liquidations or gas fees!
 $osmo - osmosis is the uniswap of Cosmos and the first dex. It went to 100m in tvl in 2 weeks. Not bad! It’s the only place in defi to get all the Cosmos tokens.
 $MOB - mobile coin is the payments token for signal. If it works out, they have millions of users who’d benefit
 $ARCx - the first onchain credit score system for defi. Not all LPs or borrowers are the same. Protocols can give better liquidation levels or better rates depending on track record 
 $RPL - if you believe staking ETH will be big, then the east staking-as-service will be too
Cryptopunks- the first @larvalabs’s innovation predated the ERC-721 token standard and was the inspiration for it.

      <itunes:summary>On this episode I welcome Jason Hitchcock, crypto sensei and Principal at To The Moon Capital. Jason (Twitter: @JasonHitchcock) was among the few to be early to Ethereum, Helium, CryptoPunks, Alchemix, and more. He has 12 years of early stage startup experience and previously held a role at Twitch and Bebo. Listen as we explore DeFi, NFTs, intermediate wealth building, the Metaverse and much more. If you are new to the space I wanted to provide a quick glossary of terms and phrases that you might not be familiar with. Check it out here:
Crypto Glossary:
 $ETH - I don’t own any Bitcoin. Bullish on Eth becoming the iOS of crypto. The next few months will be wild as miners are zeroed out, fees get burned, and staked eth yields go up. You cannot own enough eth. Setting up a validator is the easiest path to non trivial passive income
 $Luna - user friendly Defi gov token that gets more valuable as more  $UST is minted 
 $ALCX - self paying loans. ALCX will earn 10% of protocol fees in v2, and grow along with stablecoin demand
 $HNT - decentralized cellular network with parabolic growth
 $AKT - A decentralized version of AWS compute. Users pay bills with AKT and fees go to stakers at 56% apy 
 $ATOM- the gov token for the blockchain-in-a-box. Earns fees with every cross-chain transaction on IBC, the standard for interoperability.
 $crv and  $CVX: stake these to earn crazy yield from stablecoin swaps on Curve. 
 $RUNE: cross chain liquidity of native assets. This will truly bring Bitcoin to defi. Insanely hard problem to solve is solved. 
 $OGN - Shopify for NFT drops. OGN is making big deals, pay attention
 $MATIC - first mover of the L2s has already inhaled billions on liquidity, and launches major integrations every day. 
 $SUSHI - not just an exchange; but offering a full suite of smart contract templates for projects to launch their token economy. And it earns fees when staked
 $AAVE - the perpetually undervalued lending platform that has an ocean of liquidity.
$ETH2x-FLI a token that gives exposure to a perfectly executed 2x leverage strategy on Eth. When eth is up, this goes up double. No liquidations or gas fees!
 $osmo - osmosis is the uniswap of Cosmos and the first dex. It went to 100m in tvl in 2 weeks. Not bad! It’s the only place in defi to get all the Cosmos tokens.
 $MOB - mobile coin is the payments token for signal. If it works out, they have millions of users who’d benefit
 $ARCx - the first onchain credit score system for defi. Not all LPs or borrowers are the same. Protocols can give better liquidation levels or better rates depending on track record 
 $RPL - if you believe staking ETH will be big, then the east staking-as-service will be too
Cryptopunks- the first @larvalabs’s innovation predated the ERC-721 token standard and was the inspiration for it.

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money:
 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
 
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
 
I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
 
 Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
 Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
  
The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy. - Naval Ravikant

Important quotes from Naval on building wealth and the difference between wealth and money:
 
How to get rich without getting lucky. - Naval Ravikant
 
Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn. - Naval Ravikant
 
I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Seek wealth, not money or status. - Naval Ravikant
 
 Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
 
 Money is how we transfer time and wealth. - Naval Ravikant
 
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 
 
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
  
The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy. - Naval Ravikant</itunes:summary>

      <title>Almanack of Naval bonus episode and next: Jorgenson’s Soundbox</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/almanack-of-naval-bonus-episode-and-next-jorgensons-soundbox</link>
      <description>In the very first episode of Jorgenson’s soundbox Eric Jorgenson sought to use this opportunity to answer some of your core questions around The Almanack of Naval including:
 
What I learned creating the Almanack of Naval?
What story is underrated from the Alamanack of Naval?
What I have applied from The Almanack of Naval?
And of course I answered questions about leverage!
At the end of this episodes Erick Jorgenson 
 
We also go into what you can expect from Jorgenson's Soundbox. Topics can include DeFi, NFT's, How to put your money to work, education and much more. I hope you enjoy and continue on the journey to Jorgenson’s Soundbox.
A huge thank you to Naval Ravikant, Tim Ferriss, Jack Butcher, and everyone who made this book possible. Thank you for helping Eric Jorgenson help others live the lives that they want to live.

You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy. - Naval Ravikant</em></p><p>  </p>]]>

Important Quotes from the podcast on Books:
The truth is, I don’t read for self-improvement. I read out of curiosity and interest. The best book is the one you’ll devour. - Naval Ravikant
 
Read enough, and you become a connoisseur. Then you naturally gravitate more toward theory, concepts, nonfiction. - Naval Ravikant
 
I always spent money on books. I never viewed that as an expense. That’s an investment to me. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you eat, invest, and think according to what the “news” advocates, you’ll end up nutritionally, financially, and morally bankrupt. - Naval Ravikant</description>

      <title>Naval on Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/naval-on-philosophy</link>
      <description>Naval shares the biggest, deepest, oldest thoughts in this philosophy episode. What is the meaning of life? It turns out there are 3 answers, from Naval’s perspective. Naval shares the values that he lives by, and “rational buddhism” the foundation of his worldview, which involves science, evolution, and ancient eastern wisdom. At the end of the day, as Naval reminds us… the present is all we have. This very moment of consciousness to enjoy peace and find joy and happiness.

Important Quotes from the podcast on The Meaning of Life:
 
The real truths are heresies. They cannot be spoken. Only discovered, whispered, and perhaps read. - Naval Ravikant
 
Before you can lie to another, you must first lie to yourself. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Values:


Another example of a foundational value: I don’t believe in any short-term thinking or dealing. If I’m doing business with somebody and they think in a short-term manner with somebody else, then I don’t want to do business with them anymore. All benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money, relationships, love, health, activities, or habits. I only want to be around people I know I’m going to be around for the rest of my life. I only want to work on things I know have long-term payout. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Wisdom and being present:


The older the question, the older the answers. - Naval Ravikant
 
Everyone starts out innocent. Everyone is corrupted. Wisdom is the discarding of vices and the return to virtue, by way of knowledge. - Naval Ravikant
 
Inspiration is perishable—act on it immediately. - Naval Ravikant
 
“Everything is more beautiful because we’re doomed. 
You will never be lovelier than you are now, and we will never be here again.”

      <title>Naval on Saving Yourself</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/naval-on-saving-yourself</link>
      <description>As Naval says, life is a single-player game. No one else is going to make you rich. No one else is going to make you healthy. No one else is going to make you happy. You have to learn the discipline and clarity of living your own life your own way. Naval shows you the basics he has learned of health, diet, exercise, meditation, and mental strength. This is Naval’s basic blueprint for a happy life and a wealthy life. It starts with how you build yourself -- the foundation of everything.

Important Quotes from the podcast on Choosing Yourself:


All you should do is what you want to do. If you stop trying to figure out how to do things the way other people want you to do them, you get to listen to the little voice inside your head that wants to do things a certain way. Then, you get to be you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you. What you don’t want to do is build checklists and decision frameworks built on what other people are doing. You’re never going to be them. You’ll never be good at being somebody else. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Choosing To Care For Yourself:


When everyone is sick, we no longer consider it a disease. - Naval Ravikant
 
We evolved for scarcity but live in abundance. - Naval Ravikant
 
I’m not an expert, and the problem is diet and nutrition are like politics: everybody thinks they’re an expert. Their identity is wrapped up in it because what they’ve been eating or what they think they should be eating is obviously the correct answer. Everybody has a little religion—it’s just a really difficult topic to talk about. I will just say in general, any sensible diet avoids the combination of sugar and fat together. - Naval Ravikant
 
When it comes to medicine and nutrition, subtract before you add. - Naval Ravikant


World’s simplest diet: The more processed the food, the less one should consume. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important quotes from the podcast on Exercise:
 
The harder the workout, the easier the day. - Naval Ravikant
 
What I did was decide my number one priority in life, above my happiness, above my family, above my work, is my own health. It starts with my physical health. [4] Because my physical health became my number one priority, then I could never say I don’t have time. In the morning, I work out, and however long it takes is how long it takes. I do not start my day until I’ve worked out. I don’t care if the world is imploding and melting down, it can wait another thirty minutes until I’m done working out. - Naval Ravikant
 
How you make a habit doesn’t matter. Do something every day. It almost doesn’t matter what you do. The people who are obsessing over whether to do weight training, tennis, Pilates, the high-intensity interval training method, “The Happy Body,” or whatever. They’re missing the point. The important thing is to do something every day. It doesn’t matter what it is. The best workout for you is one you’re excited enough to do every day. - Naval Ravikant</description>

      <title>Naval Ravikant on Learning Happiness</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/naval-ravikant-on-learning-happiness</link>
      <description>Naval has such a following because he is successful financially AND happy, in the sense that he has focused on learning happiness. Naval built happiness habits, reminders and behaviors that create an inner peace. This episode has Naval’s best ideas on how envy, success, and desire can interfere with your innate happiness, and how you can defend it or win it back. It all starts with realizing that happiness is a choice, and happiness is a skill. You can train yourself into happiness through perspectives and Naval’s small changes in thinking habits.

Important Quotes from the podcast on Happiness as a choice:
 
The Tao Te Ching says this more articulately than I ever could, but it’s all duality and polarity. If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you believe Happiness is a choice you can start to work on it - Naval Ravikant
The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever. - Naval Ravikant
 
Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose. - Naval Ravikant
 
Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace into happiness anytime you want. But peace is what you want most of the time. If you’re a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Success and Desire:
 
When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people happier than you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Tell your friends you’re a happy person. Then, you’ll be forced to conform to it. You’ll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person. - Naval Ravikant


Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Anxiety:


I think a lot of us have this low-level pervasive feeling of anxiety. If you pay attention to your mind, sometimes you’re just running around doing your thing and you’re not feeling great, and you notice your mind is chattering and chattering about something. Maybe you can’t sit still…There’s this “nexting” thing where you’re sitting in one spot thinking about where you should be next. - Naval Ravikant
 
It’s most obvious if you ever just sit down and try and do nothing, nothing. I mean nothing, I mean not read a book, I mean not listen to music, I mean literally just sit down and do nothing. You can’t do it, because there’s anxiety always trying to make you get up and go, get up and go, get up and go. I think it’s important just being aware the anxiety is making you unhappy. The anxiety is just a series of running thoughts. - Naval Ravikant
 
How I combat anxiety: I don’t try and fight it, I just notice I’m anxious because of all these thoughts. I try to figure out, “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?” Because as long as I have my thoughts, I can’t have my peace. - Naval Ravikant</description>

      <itunes:summary>Naval has such a following because he is successful financially AND happy, in the sense that he has focused on learning happiness. Naval built happiness habits, reminders and behaviors that create an inner peace. This episode has Naval’s best ideas on how envy, success, and desire can interfere with your innate happiness, and how you can defend it or win it back. It all starts with realizing that happiness is a choice, and happiness is a skill. You can train yourself into happiness through perspectives and Naval’s small changes in thinking habits.

Important Quotes from the podcast on Happiness as a choice:
 
The Tao Te Ching says this more articulately than I ever could, but it’s all duality and polarity. If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive. - Naval Ravikant
 
If you believe Happiness is a choice you can start to work on it - Naval Ravikant
The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever. - Naval Ravikant
 
Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose. - Naval Ravikant
 
Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace into happiness anytime you want. But peace is what you want most of the time. If you’re a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity. - Naval Ravikant
 
Important Quotes from the podcast on Success and Desire:
 
When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people happier than you. - Naval Ravikant
 
Tell your friends you’re a happy person. Then, you’ll be forced to conform to it. You’ll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person. - Naval Ravikant


Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. - Naval Ravikant

      <title>Naval Ravikant on How to Build Judgement</title>
      <link>https://ericjorgenson.libsyn.com/naval-ravikant-on-how-to-build-judgement</link>
      <description>Naval says building good judgement is a foundation to building wealth and getting rich. But how do we build judgement? How do we get smarter? Become wiser? Make better decisions? This episode focuses on Naval’s advice for learning to learn, learning to think, learning to see reality. This helps you make good business decisions, investment decisions, and good partnership decisions. We talk about Naval’s favorite books, mental models, and his techniques for reading. By the end of this episode, we hope you are a little calmer, a little wiser, and more assured in your path.

Important Quotes from the podcast on Judgement and thinking clearly:
 
Wisdom applied to external problems is judgement - Naval
 
“Clear thinker” is a better compliment than “smart.” - Naval Ravikant
 
Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority. - Naval
 
The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. - Naval Ravikant
 
Very smart people tend to be weird since they insist on thinking everything through for themselves.
 
A contrarian isn’t one who always objects—that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform. 
 
Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed. - Naval Ravikant


Important Quotes from the podcast on Wealth, Business, and Entrepreneurship:

You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. 
You get rich by saving your time to make money. - Naval Ravikant
 
One definition of a moment of suffering is “the moment when you see things exactly the way they are.” This whole time, you’ve been convinced your business is doing great, and really, you’ve ignored the signs it’s not doing well. Then, your business fails, and you suffer because you’ve been putting off reality. You’ve been hiding it from yourself. - Naval
 
The more desire I have for something to work out a certain way, the less likely I am to see the truth. Especially in business, if something isn’t going well, I try to acknowledge it publicly and I try to acknowledge it publicly in front of my co-founders and friends and co-workers. Then, I’m not hiding it from anybody else. If I’m not hiding it from anybody, I’m not going to delude myself from what’s actually going on. - Naval Ravikant

Important Quotes from the podcast on Leverage:
In an age of leverage, one correct decision can win everything. - Naval
 
You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important. The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. - Naval Ravikant
 
Charisma is the ability to project confidence and love at the same time. It’s almost always possible to be honest and positive. - Naval
 
I think people have a hard time understanding a fundamental fact of leverage. If I manage $1 billion and I’m right 10 percent more often than somebody else, my decision-making creates $100 million worth of value on a judgment call. With modern technology and large workforces and capital, our decisions are leveraged more and more. - Naval Ravikant</description>

      <title>Prologue featuring Naval Ravikant, Tim Ferriss, and Eric Jorgenson</title>
      <link>https://chrt.fm/track/1B6C2G/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/ericjorgenson/Episode_1_Prologue.mp3</link>
      <description>I built the Almanack of Naval Ravikant or Navalmanack entirely out of transcripts, Tweets, and talks Naval has shared. Every attempt is made to present Naval in his own words. However, there are a few important points. 
 

 The transcripts have been edited for clarity and brevity (multiple times). 

 Not all sources are primary (some excerpts are from other writers quoting Naval). 

 I can’t be 100 percent certain of every source’s authenticity. 

 Concepts and interpretations change over time, medium, and context. 

 Please verify phrasing with a primary source before citing Naval from this text.

Please interpret generously. 

 
By definition, everything in this book is taken out of context. Interpretations will change over time. Read and interpret generously. Understand the original intent may be different than your interpretation in a different time, medium, format, and context. 
 
In the process of creating this book, I may have mistakenly re-contextualized, misinterpreted, or misunderstood things. As content passed through time, space, and medium, some phrasing may have shifted in flight. Every effort has been made to maintain the original intent, but errors are (very) possible. 
 
Interviews have been transcribed, edited, rearranged, and re-edited for readability. I did my best to keep Naval’s ideas in his own words. 
 
All brilliance in this book is Naval’s; any mistakes are mine.

If you don’t have time for the podcast here are a few important quotes from the prologue of The Almanack of Naval.
 
Naval Ravikant has changed my life for the better, and if you approach the following pages like a friendly but highly competent sparring partner, he might just change yours. - Tim Ferriss
 
“Naval is one of the smartest people I have ever met and he is one of the most courageous.” - Tim Ferriss 
 
“I’ve learned a few things, and some principles. I try to lay them out in a timeless manner, where you can figure it out for yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can’t quite teach anything. I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you can remember.” - Naval Ravikant
 
“Naval is one of the people I call most for advice” - Tim Ferriss
 
“Books make for great friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand years tell you their nuggets of wisdom.” - Naval Ravikant
 
“I take Naval seriously because he:
 
Questions nearly everything 
Can think from first principles
Tests things well
Is good at not fooling himself 
Changes his mind regularly 
Laughs a lot 
Thinks holistically 
Thinks long-term 
And…doesn’t take himself too goddamn seriously. 
 
That last one is important” - Tim Ferriss</description>

      <itunes:subtitle>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>I built the Almanack of Naval Ravikant or Navalmanack entirely out of transcripts, Tweets, and talks Naval has shared. Every attempt is made to present Naval in his own words. However, there are a few important points. 
 

 The transcripts have been edited for clarity and brevity (multiple times). 

 Not all sources are primary (some excerpts are from other writers quoting Naval). 

 I can’t be 100 percent certain of every source’s authenticity. 

 Concepts and interpretations change over time, medium, and context. 

 Please verify phrasing with a primary source before citing Naval from this text.

Please interpret generously. 

 
By definition, everything in this book is taken out of context. Interpretations will change over time. Read and interpret generously. Understand the original intent may be different than your interpretation in a different time, medium, format, and context. 
 
In the process of creating this book, I may have mistakenly re-contextualized, misinterpreted, or misunderstood things. As content passed through time, space, and medium, some phrasing may have shifted in flight. Every effort has been made to maintain the original intent, but errors are (very) possible. 
 
Interviews have been transcribed, edited, rearranged, and re-edited for readability. I did my best to keep Naval’s ideas in his own words. 
 
All brilliance in this book is Naval’s; any mistakes are mine.

If you don’t have time for the podcast here are a few important quotes from the prologue of The Almanack of Naval.
 
Naval Ravikant has changed my life for the better, and if you approach the following pages like a friendly but highly competent sparring partner, he might just change yours. - Tim Ferriss
 
“Naval is one of the smartest people I have ever met and he is one of the most courageous.” - Tim Ferriss 
 
“I’ve learned a few things, and some principles. I try to lay them out in a timeless manner, where you can figure it out for yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can’t quite teach anything. I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you can remember.” - Naval Ravikant
 
“Naval is one of the people I call most for advice” - Tim Ferriss
 
“Books make for great friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand years tell you their nuggets of wisdom.” - Naval Ravikant
 
“I take Naval seriously because he:
 
Questions nearly everything 
Can think from first principles
Tests things well
Is good at not fooling himself 
Changes his mind regularly 
Laughs a lot 
Thinks holistically 
Thinks long-term 
And…doesn’t take himself too goddamn seriously. 
 
That last one is important” - Tim Ferriss</itunes:summary>
