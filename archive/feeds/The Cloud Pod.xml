	<title>TCP Talks: SAP Cloud Migrations with Protera CTO, Patrick Osterhaus</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This interview is part of a paid sponsorship between Protera and The Cloud Pod. </em></p>
<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Patrick Osterhaus, CTO and Founder of <a href="https://www.protera.com/?utm_source=cloud_pod&amp;utm_medium=influencer_podcast&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_pod_protera_2020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Protera Technologies</a>, a preeminent provider for SAP and cloud managed services.</p>
<p>Patrick discusses how the cloud, COVID-19, and work-from-home are influencing SAP and legacy enterprise software packages today, and Protera’s goal to provide the very best SAP services available on the cloud.
</p>
<p>Covering issues around migration to SAP, Patrick takes the opportunity to reflect on Protera’s history, while also addressing corporate IT integration. “We call this the transformation journey-site assessment, specific to each client’s needs, looking beyond SAP to the SAP systems, we use a tool we call [Protera] FlexBridgeSM,” notes Patrick.

<p>Name: <a href="https://www.protera.com/author/patrick-osterhaus/?utm_source=cloud_pod&amp;utm_medium=influencer_podcast&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_pod_protera_2020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Patrick Osterhaus</a></p>
<p>What he does: Patrick is CTO and Founder of <a href="https://www.protera.com/?utm_source=cloud_pod&amp;utm_medium=influencer_podcast&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_pod_protera_2020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Protera Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Key quote: “The complexity of moving to public cloud is getting those non-cloud native applications into the cloud, and then looking at the transformation of those applications once they&#8217;re in the cloud.”</p>
<p>Where to find him: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/protera?utm_source=cloud_pod&amp;utm_medium=influencer_podcast&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_pod_protera_2020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ProteraTech?utm_source=cloud_pod&amp;utm_medium=influencer_podcast&amp;utm_campaign=cloud_pod_protera_2020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> </p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>The best way to prepare for cloud migration is what Patrick calls “the journey,” which involves a site assessment of the customer environment and understanding how everything on-premise, or in a hybrid environment, is working together.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has accelerated migration to the cloud and has forced companies to plan their disaster recovery systems. Patrick says businesses aren’t just thinking about their earpiece systems — the thinking extends to ancillary systems like CRMs and web access systems — “all these systems to be connected and have it fully available in the cloud as a backup.”  He adds, “We&#8217;ve seen a natural interest in what is good practice,” which is to have a protection plan for critical SAP applications.</p>
<p>Working with many compliance-heavy industries, such as financial or military and defense clients, Protera stresses has learned the importance of not only application security, but also the physical security necessary around data centers. He says the discussing the real-world protection of data centers — “who owns the data, how it’s governed, how it’s protected” — is important to raise with the client. </p>

<p>[6:14] &#8220;And the big challenge with SAP, in my opinion, is they have such a tremendous customer base that is already running in their own data centers … and the challenges to make that transition. And being that they&#8217;re not just the number of customers and the number of SAP systems each of those customers has, but just the tremendous volumes of data.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses the conspiracy theory surrounding media coverage of daylight savings and continues counting down to re:Invent. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

Use the code THECLOUDPOD for 50% off its training platform. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon sells a whole bunch of stuff on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2020-powered-by-aws/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">its website</a>.</li>
<li> Google is nosy and wants people to know what files <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/securely-managed-cloud-sql-databases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’ve been looking at</a>.</li>
<li> Azure wants people to think more with its <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quickly-get-started-with-samples-in-azure-synapse-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new knowledge center</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Getting Excited for re:Invent </h3>
<ul>
<li> Jeff Barr shares how AWS helped to make <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2020-powered-by-aws/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prime Day a reality</a> for its customers. Congratulations to the Amazon Ops and Dev teams for this amazing feat. </li>
<li> AWS Global Accelerator announces the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/aws-global-accelerator-launches-port-overrides/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ability to override destination ports</a> used to route traffic to an application endpoint.

This week’s highlights

 Amazon sells a whole bunch of stuff on its website.
 Google is nosy and wants people to know what files you’ve been looking at.
 Azure wants people to think more with its new knowledge center.

Amazon Web Services: Getting Excited for re:Invent 

 Jeff Barr shares how AWS helped to make Prime Day a reality for its customers. Congratulations to the Amazon Ops and Dev teams for this amazing feat. 
 AWS Global Accelerator announces the ability to override destination ports used to route traffic to an application endpoint. Pretty neat! 
 AWS is launching AWS Distro for Open Telemetry in preview. We’re excited to see what this builds out to become.   
 AWS launches fully managed publishing/subscribing messaging service enabling message delivery to a large number of subscribers. This is great and we already have use cases for this.  
 Amazon introduces the AWS Load Balancer Controller to simplify operations and save costs — a huge win for anyone using EKS today.  
 AWS CloudFormation now supports increased limits on five service quotas. Sounds good unless you’re trying to make smaller CloudFormation templates.     

Google Cloud Platform: A Bit Confused

 GCP is introducing new Scale-in controls for Compute Engine, to prevent the autoscaler from reducing a managed instance group size too far. We’re a bit confused by the term “Scale-in.” 
 GCP improves security and governance in PostgreSQL with Cloud SQL. Great for companies that are highly audited.
 Google updates Firebase with new emulator and data analysis tools. Really great stuff!  

Azure: Busy Building Services It Promised For JEDI

 Microsoft announces multiple new features for Azure VPN Gateway in public preview. Some of these are amazing!  
 Azure introduces the Knowledge center to simplify access to pre-loaded sample data. That electrical smell is the Team&#8217;s synapses firing on this one.   
 Azure has announced that it will establish its first cloud datacenter region in Taiwan. It feels a bit like they’re trying to sell this as a good idea.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Justin may be out but the cloud stops for no one. Also, AWS announces a New Zealand region, GCP releases GKE Backup, and Azure Functions 4.0 is now in public preview. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Grab your togs and sunnies! AWS is opening a New Zealand region to serve Asia Pacific. The move is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs in the next 15 years.  </li>
<li> GCP users can now protect their GKE workloads with GKE Backup, which helps automate recovery tasks and shows reporting for compliance and audit purposes.</li>
<li> Azure Functions 4.0 has arrived — in public preview, that is. It’s expected to be generally available by November 2021, just in time for the .NET 6.0 release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Microsoft Excel is still the most powerful tool for making business decisions. And [Amazon QuickSight] is the same thing: It&#8217;s a way to visualize the raw data you have. Being able to ask a service a question in normal words is gonna be super powerful.”</li>
<li> “It’s funny because for at least the last 18 months, this has been my daily life: Thinking hard about how software makes it from environment to environment and into production. And no matter where you&#8217;re hosting this workload — what cloud provider, what technology — there are trials and tribulations and hurdles that have to be overcome … So I’d like to see more of these bespoke deployment technologies that are really focused on doing one thing really well, rather than doing all things.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: AWS says ‘Kia Ora’ to its Newest Region: New Zealand</h3>
<ul>
<li> With the newly available <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-quicksight-q" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon QuickSight</a>, business users can use natural language (read: normal words) to quickly create interactive BI dashboards and receive accurate insights and data visualizations. </li>
<li> Look out, Kiwis and hobbits: <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-open-data-centers-new-zealand" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon is set to open new data centers in New Zealand</a> by 2024, adding the AWS Asia Pacific (Auckland) Region to its 81 existing availability zones. It’s estimated that the new region will create 1,000 jobs in the next 15 years, but we believe it will have an even bigger impact. </li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-distro-for-opentelemetry-tracing-support-is-now-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tracing support is now generally available in AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.</a> Users can now send telemetry data to various AWS applications as well as partner destinations. Telemetry, dear Watson. </li>
<li> AWS releases <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/aqua-amazon-redshift-ra3-xlplus-nodes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AQ UA (Advanced Query Accelerator) for Amazon Redshift RA3.xlplus nodes</a>. This new distributed and hardware-accelerated cache enables Redshift to run up to 10X faster than AWS competitors by boosting certain query types. Magic!</li>
<li> AWS users can now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-macie-managed-data-identifiers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">easily select, detect and manage sensitive data with Amazon Macie</a>. Using machine learning and pattern matching, users can create custom alerts based on the specific data governance and privacy needs of their organizations. </li>
<li> You can now (finally) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-ecr-replicate-individual-repositories-regions-accounts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">replicate individual repositories to other regions and accounts with Amazon ECR</a> — instead of all images in the registry.  </li>
<li> Christmas has come early this year for Amazon EC2 users. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/aws-microsoft-windows-server-2022-amazon-ec2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Windows Server 2022 AMIs are now officially available</a> on AWS, meaning you can now enjoy the latest Windows features. </li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Making Stateless Stateful with GKE Backup</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/09/16/google-extends-cloud-storage-capabilities-choice-around-data-replication/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google expands its cloud storage capabilities</a>, allowing users to choose from a larger selection of regions for their data replication, rather than the previous dual-region buckets.</li>
<li> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/google-cloud-launches-backups-for-gke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google releases GKE Backup</a> to help users protect, manage and restore stateful application data — or basically make your containers VMs. </li>
<li> Google announces the release of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Deploy</a>, which allows users to define <a href="https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivery pipelines</a> and targets for each release, making continuous delivery to GKE faster and more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Azure: Welcome to the Azure Peep Show</h3>
<ul>
<li>4&#x20e3; <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-functions-runtime-40-is-now-in-public-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Functions 4.0 is now in public preview</a> and is expected to be released in November 2021 to coincide with the planned release of .NET 6.0.

<li> Java apps users can soon view richer data from their functions applications — i.e. requests, logs, metrics — with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-distributed-tracing-for-java-apps-on-azure-functions-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Monitor’s application insights integration with Azure Functions</a> on Linux. Currently in public preview, the integration will feature monitoring for the application insights Java 3.x agent. </li>
<li> A twofer! <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-database-for-mysql-azure-pipelines-support-in-public-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Database for MySQL</a> and<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-database-for-postgresql-flexible-server-azure-pipelines-in-public-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PostgreSQL Pipeline Support</a> are now in public preview.

	<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Three Musketeers have gained their D’Artagnan and take on the world (metaphorically and from home) on this week&#8217;s episode of The Cloud Pod.
A big thanks to this week’s sponsor:

AWS: Global Reach, Mediocre Branding

 The butt of TCP jokes at Re:Invent — Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Services — has rebranded to Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) and became generally available.
 AWS Transfer for Secure File Transfer Protocol now supports File Transfer Protocol and File Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS. Please, please don’t use File Transfer Protocol if you’re transferring data of any sensitivity.
 AWS published their guide to CloudWatch Synthetics in a blog post. In fact, we set it up for The Cloud Pod and it’s running cleanly.
# Amazon AppFlow promises to automate the data flows between AWS services and SaaS apps. This might actually be a good piece to build onto #NoCode.
 AWS Chatbot is now generally available for anyone to use for ChatOps. They’ve added quite a bit since we last saw this at Re:Invent.
 You can cross it off your predictions bingo card: AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region and AWS Europe (Milan) Region are open for business.

The promised xkcd comic: https://xkcd.com/705/


 Those of you carefully budgeting your cloud spends may be interested to know that cost controls are now available for Amazon Redshift Spectrum and Concurrency Scaling.
 AWS Control Tower will allow you to create and manage multi-account environments. That fixes an entire half of the problem!
 AWS Glue promises to manage streaming data automatically. Break out the acetone because this is Super Glue now.

Google: 

 Anthos support for Multi-cloud is now generally available. All the boundless freedom of locking into Anthos!
 Migrate for Anthos has been updated with enhanced Virtual-Machine-to-container conversion capabilities. It’s a big deal assum]]></itunes:summary>

 The rash of automated “Meow” attacks has deleted at least 3,800 databases. The deleted text is replaced with random text and the word “Meow”, hence the name. And deleting unsecured databases does keep it from being leaked&#8230;
 Matthew Prince of Cloudflare believes their new Workers Unbound platform will beat the big three providers on performance and price. Good luck making money on those margins.

Azure: Following the Blueprints

 Azure has made the new Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework available in the Azure Architecture Center. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?
 Azure shared disks and other Disk Storage enhancements are now generally available.
 The next generation of Azure Stack HCI features native Azure Hybrid capabilities.

<h3>Amazon Pressures Pentagon, Suffers in Sydney</h3>
<p> On January 22, Amazon <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/01/23/aws-files-motion-stop-jedi-cloud-computing-contract-work/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">filed a motion</a> to halt work on the JEDI contract between Microsoft and the Department of Defense until a court rules on the protest filed by Amazon last year. Expect more news here as the story develops through February.</p>
<p> That same day, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/aws-suffers-cloud-problems-in-sydney-region-536917" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">six hour outage</a> across multiple services in the Sydney region “including EC2, elastic load balancing (ELB), relational database service (RDS), AppStream 2.0, ElastiCache, WorkSpaces and Lambda.” After the issue was resolved, Amazon assured customers it will use this experience to learn and improve future operational performance.</p>
<h3>AWS Adds, Updates and Improves</h3>
<p> AWS DataSync has received an update: You can now use DataSync to quickly transfer large amounts of data to and from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-datasync-update-support-for-amazon-fsx-for-windows-file-server/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</a>. Previously, DataSync was not fully compatible with Windows applications and environments.</p>
<p> All seven sizes of the T3 instances are now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t3-instances-on-dedicated-single-tenant-hardware/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">available on single-tenant hardware</a>. It might help you meet your compliance goals by physically isolating your machine from other AWS accounts, but the unlimited bursting capability makes us wonder what use cases Amazon has in mind for these.</p>
<p> Amazon GuardDuty has globally released a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/01/amazon-guardduty-announces-threat-detection-enhancements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">threat detection enhancement</a> which should allow customers with common architectures to see fewer false alarms, and ultimately 50 percent fewer alerts overall.</p>
<p> You can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/01/announcing-amazon-relational-database-service-snapshot-export-to-s3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now export</a> Amazon Relational Database Service or Amazon Aurora snapshots to Amazon Simple Storage Service as Apache Parquet. Compared to uncompressed text, Parquet is twice as fast to export and takes up one-sixth the storage space.</p>
<p> The new Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/01/aws-iam-policy-simulator-now-simulates-permissions-boundary-policies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">policy simulator</a> will allow administrators to test new permission boundary policies without removing the old ones, heavily streamlining the process of implementing new permissions.</p>
<p> Amazon announced that Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image security support will be <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/update-on-amazon-linux-ami-end-of-life/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">phased out</a> over the next few years until June 2023, instead of June 2020. This should give users the time they need to move from Amazon Linux 1 to Amazon Linux 2.</p>
<h3>Google Kills and Creates Services</h3>
<p> If you’re a data scientist, you’ll be pleased to hear that Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/cloud-data-science-and-ml-with-open-source-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataproc has been updated</a> with several new features: autoscaling and notebook support, logging and monitoring enhancements for SparkR job types, accelerator support for GPUs, and scheduled cluster deletion.</p>
<p> The NVIDIA T4 GPU AI deployments are now<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cheaper-cloud-ai-deployments-with-nvidia-t4-gpu-price-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> over 60 percent cheaper</a>, which also makes them cheaper to run than their AWS counterpart, the g4dn.xlarge.</p>
<p> BigQuery rolled out their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/whats-happening-in-bigquery-jan2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January update announcement</a> which included several new interesting features including new machine learning capabilities.</p>
<p> Google announced it will <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/01/27/appsheet-buy-google-says-will-shut-low-code-app-maker-service/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shut down</a> its low-code App Maker service on January 19, 2021. Google claimed the move was due to low usage, but it is likely that Google is simply shifting focus over to the recently-acquired AppSheet.</p>
<p> Google Cloud’s new <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-google-clouds-secret-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Manager</a> service offers sensitive data storage at 15 percent the price of AWS Secret Manager. Expect AWS to make a competitive price drop soon.</p>
<p> Forrester Consulting released a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/4-ways-anthos-delivers-roi-to-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> claiming four ways Anthos delivers a return on investment to customers. Well, it reads more like a paid advertisement than a study.

This week’s highlights

 Ian Mckay gives an Aussie perspective on the AWS outage in Sydney.
 Amazon streamlines permissions with the IAM policy simulator.
 Google competes with AWS with competitively priced services.

Amazon Pressures Pentagon, Suffers in Sydney
 On January 22, Amazon filed a motion to halt work on the JEDI contract between Microsoft and the Department of Defense until a court rules on the protest filed by Amazon last year. Expect more news here as the story develops through February.
 That same day, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a six hour outage across multiple services in the Sydney region “including EC2, elastic load balancing (ELB), relational database service (RDS), AppStream 2.0, ElastiCache, WorkSpaces and Lambda.” After the issue was resolved, Amazon assured customers it will use this experience to learn and improve future operational performance.
AWS Adds, Updates and Improves
 AWS DataSync has received an update: You can now use DataSync to quickly transfer large amounts of data to and from Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Previously, DataSync was not fully compatible with Windows applications and environments.
 All seven sizes of the T3 instances are now available on single-tenant hardware. It might help you meet your compliance goals by physically isolating your machine from other AWS accounts, but the unlimited bursting capability makes us wonder what use cases Amazon has in mind for these.
 Amazon GuardDuty has globally released a threat detection enhancement which should allow customers with common architectures to see fewer false alarms, and ultimately 50 percent fewer alerts overall.
 You can now export Amazon Relational Database Service or Amazon Aurora snapshots to Amazon Simple Storage Service as Apache Parquet. Compared to uncompressed text, Parquet is twice as fast to export and takes up one-sixth the storage space.
 The new Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy simulator will allow administrators to test new permission boundary policies without removing the old ones, heavily streamlining the process of implementing new permissions.
 Amazon announced that Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image security support will be phased out over the next few years until June 2023, instead of June 2020. This should give users the time they need to move from Amazon Linux 1 to Amazon Linux 2.
Google Kills and Creates Services
 If you’re a data scientist, you’ll be pleased to hear that Google Cloud’s Dataproc has been updated with several new features: autoscaling and notebook support, logging and monitoring enhancements for SparkR job types, accelerator support for GPUs, and scheduled cluster deletion.
 The NVIDIA T4 GPU AI deployments are now over 60 percent cheaper, which also makes them cheaper to run than their AWS counterpart, the g4dn.xlarge.
 BigQuery rolled out their January update announcement which included several new interesting features including new machine learning capabilities.
 Google announced it will shut down its low-code App Maker service on January 19, 2021. Google claimed the move was due to low usage, but it is likely that Google is simply shifting focus over to the recently-acquired AppSheet.
 Google Cloud’s new Secret Manager service offers sensitive data storage at 15 percent the price of AWS Secret Manager. ]]></itunes:summary>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, it’s a merry-go-round of vacations, with Jonathan returning and Ryan escaping while Peter tunes in from Hawaii. Also, there is some big news in an otherwise quiet week.               </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces that Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) users can now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-customers-can-assign-ip-prefixes-ec2-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">assign IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes</a> to EC2 instances. It should help simplify the process of using container and networking applications that require multiple IP addresses.</li>
<li> AWS releases a new feature for SAM CLI, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/simplify-ci-cd-configuration-serverless-applications-your-favorite-ci-cd-system-public-preview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SAM Pipelines</a>. It provides quick and easy access to the benefits of CI/CD, making it easier to get out new products faster and check for errors.</li>
<li> Microsoft has acquired security platform <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/21/microsoft-doubles-down-on-cybersecurity-with-cloudknox-acquisition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CloudKnox</a>, which was designed to work across multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I hope to see more of these [SAM Pipelines-style features]. It’s been one of my mental blocks. I&#8217;ve been using serverless ever since Lambda was announced, but building into a pipeline is such a chore. And Jenkins is such a chore in itself. So if you have a canned way to deploy a pipeline, it&#8217;s great.”</li>
<li> “I think it [CloudKnox] had a potential to be really interesting and really valuable. But Azure was actually building a lot of these capabilities into their cloud natively, including least privilege access. And Google&#8217;s building that kind of stuff too. So I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a long runway left for them to get a lot of adoption and a lot of new customers, or if they’re going to be replaced by the cloud providers over time, and ultimately not be needed.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Don’t Off Slack</h3>
<ul>
<li> Salesforce has completed its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/21/salesforce-completes-27-7b-slack-acquisition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acquisition of Slack for $27.7 billion</a>. Hopefully they don’t kill slack because we do not want to use Teams. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Winning</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon Virtual Private Cloud customers can now assign <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-customers-can-assign-ip-prefixes-ec2-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IP prefixes to their EC2 instances</a>. Being able to assign multiple IPs is super helpful, so there are some great use cases for this. </li>
<li> AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) Pipelines is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/simplify-ci-cd-configuration-serverless-applications-your-favorite-ci-cd-system-public-preview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a new feature of the AWS SAM CLI</a>. We hope to see more of these types of announceme]]></description>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> An unusually short AWS segment this week featured new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-backup-supports-new-options-for-customizing-backup-selections/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Backup customizations</a>.</li>
<li> Azure is bringing their HoloLens2 to a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/hololens-2-expands-markets-azure-mixed-reality-services-now-broadly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new set of countries</a>.</li>
<li> We celebrate <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-turns-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigQuery’s 10th birthday</a> and the accompanying BigSale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Only Three Stories Somehow</h3>
<ul>
<li> Jonah Jones of the AWS Open Source Blog published <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/monitor-aws-services-used-by-kubernetes-with-prometheus-and-promcat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">an article</a> on how to use the PromCat (Prometheus Catalog) to monitor AWS services used by Kubernetes. It’s great to see Prometheus and Kubernetes continue to take over the world.</li>
<li> You can now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-backup-supports-new-options-for-customizing-backup-selections/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">opt-in or opt-out</a> of AWS Backup services at the account level. Opt-in is nice and all, but opt-out provides peace of mind to the largest user base.</li>
<li> Information on AWS regions and servers is now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-query-for-aws-regions-endpoints-and-more-using-aws-systems-manager-parameter-store/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">available programmatically</a> in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. It’ll be nice when we see other tools pulling this data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Azure: Mixed With What?</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/hololens-2-expands-markets-azure-mixed-reality-services-now-broadly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HoloLens 2</a>, the latest in Azure’s “mixed reality” glasses technology, is now available in 10 countries and will be coming to more soon. Once the technology becomes as functional as it is in the advertisements, we’re going to be thrilled to play with it. There’s a lot of potential here for industrial applications that are already being explored.</li>
<li> The Azure Arc preview <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-arc-enabled-kubernetes-preview-and-new-ecosystem-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now supports Kubernetes</a> which was hotly requested in customer feedback. Expect to see some very interesting use cases from Azure Arc in the next 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google: Happy Birthday!</h3>
<ul>
<li> After dropping out early in the JEDI contract competition citing conflicts with its AI principals, Google has signed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/google-cloud-earns-defense-contract-win-for-anthos-multi-cloud-management-tool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">seven-figure contract</a> with the Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit. Google anticipates that this may lead to future business deals with branches of the DoD.</li>
<li> Serverless VPC Access now features <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/learn-how-to-use-advanced-vpc-functionality-with-your-cloud-functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress settings</a>. It’s really nice to see a tightening down of function access on VPCs and vice versa. This should make a lot of people happy.<]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s a Wednesday so things could be better, but spare a thought for the team as they battle Mother Nature on The Cloud Pod this week.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon is forking people off <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">big time</a>.</li>
<li> Google wants to help you lose those <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/no-code-development/build-your-own-workout-app-5-stepswithout-coding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandemic lockdown pounds</a>.</li>
<li> Azure didn’t overwhelm anyone with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cost-management-and-billing-updates-january-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its “problem.”</a>  </li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: The Elastic Kerfuffle</h3>
<ul>
<li> Elastic blames Amazon for forcing it to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">change its licensing</a>. One of the most ridiculous blog posts ever.   </li>
<li> Logz.io looks to launch <a href="https://logz.io/blog/open-source-elasticsearch-doubling-down/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a true open-source distribution</a> for Elasticsearch and Kibana. Everybody’s forking now.</li>
<li> AWS has also announced that it <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">will also fork its project</a> for a truly open source Elasticsearch. The beginning of the end for Elasticsearch.  </li>
<li> Logz.io followed up its previous announcement by announcing it’s <a href="https://logz.io/blog/truly-doubling-down-on-open-source-2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">combining its efforts with Amazon</a>. This is great news for the open-source community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Let’s Talk</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS Lex has released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-lex-enhanced-console-experience/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a new console experience and new V2 APIs</a> to make it easier to build, deploy and manage conversational experiences. We’ve played with it and it’s very nice.     </li>
<li> Amazon CloudWatch Agent now supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/01/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-now-supports-opentelemetry-apis-and-sdks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry APIs and Software Development Kits</a>. Could be a sign it’s about to make a lot of investments in OpenTelemetry and is moving away from CloudWatch. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the results of the AWS Summit prediction draft are in. It was probably worth getting up early for — especially if you’re Jonathan.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> At the Summit, AWS announces AWS Backup Audit Manager, sealing the prediction draft winner: Congratulations, Jonathan.</li>
<li> Outside the Summit, AWS announces MemoryDB for Redis, new split charge rules, and cybersecurity updates.</li>
<li> Former AWS leader Charlie Bell is joining Microsoft. What his role will be is unclear, but we speculate that he’ll play some part in improving Azure availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I suspect that certificate-based access to the console is going to be more prevalent. I don&#8217;t know of this in Microsoft Azure or Amazon, but I also know that this is one of the things popping up in custom security audits or in documentation that I&#8217;ve started to see more and more, which is, how do you control access to this publicly available API?”</li>
<li> “This could be an additional $5 billion boost in revenue for Microsoft Office 365, which is important to us because Microsoft 365 is included in the Azure number and reported as one line item. So a $5 billion increase could be a pretty big increase in revenue and growth that Azure could then tout and say, We are finally the biggest, fastest-growing cloud.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Later Days</h3>
<ul>
<li> GitHub is <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-12-git-password-authentication-is-shutting-down/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">saying goodbye to password authorization</a>, but you can still create a personal access token to log in. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: We’ve Reached the Summit</h3>
<ul>
<li> Redis users in <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-memorydb-redis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">select regions</a> can now use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-memorydb-for-redis-a-redis-compatible-durable-in-memory-database-service/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon MemoryDB</a> to boost their application performance with data durability, microsecond read, and single-digit millisecond writes. Unlike ElastiCache, MemoryDB does not require adding a cache from your database to achieve low latency.</li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/happy-15th-birthday-amazon-ec2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 turns 15 this year</a>. Launched with a single instance in 2006, there are now over 400 variations of instances. Happy birthday, EC2 — next year we’ll buy you a car. </li>
<li> Good news for finance pros: AWS Cost Categories will now allow you to create <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/08/cost-categories-split-charge-rules-allocation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">split charge rules</a> to allocate shared costs to different categories. Time to bust out the corporate card. </li>
<li> IAM Access Analyzer users can (finally) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/08/iam-access-analyzer-generate-iam-policies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">get rid of localized cloud trails</a> and consolidate them into a single ac]]></description>

<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;"> This week’s highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon gives customers the opportunity to<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ebs-volume-type-io2-more-iops-gib-higher-durability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> spend lots of money</a> with them.</li>
<li> Your hosts sit on the fence discussing Google’s<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/developer-productivity-announcements-at-next20-onair" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new platform</a>.</li>
<li> Azure gets features everybody else<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/release-of-new-azure-cdn-microsoft-standard-capability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> already has</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General: The Great Google Outage</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google explained how and why<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/gmail_outage_root_cause/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> big chunks of its cloud crashed</a> last week — turns out it broke itself. Google didn’t tell us who broke it because developers shouldn’t be publicly shamed&#8230; although they did break Google. That’s pretty bad.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Dollar Bills</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon introduced the<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-the-newest-aws-heroes-august-2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> newest AWS Heroes</a> who go above and beyond to share AWS knowledge and teach others. It’s great to see friend of the show, Ian McKay, recognized for his awesomeness.         </li>

Slowly but surely, it’s becoming the tool we’ve always wanted.    </li>
<li> Amazon launches new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/api-gateway-http-apis-adds-integration-with-five-aws-services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> API Gateway</a> to manage business rules around how data is created, stored and changed in AWS services. We think this is a complete rewrite due to the fact they’re having to reimplement integrations.</li>
<li> AWS Controllers for<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/aws-controllers-for-kubernetes-ack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Kubernetes is a new tool</a> that makes it simple to build scalable and highly-available Kubernetes applications.

	<title>TCP Talks with Aqua Security’s Liz Rice</title>
	<link>https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/tcp-talks-with-aqua-securitys-liz-rice/</link>
	<pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
	<dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Brodley, Jonathan Baker, Ryan Lucas and Matthew Kohn]]></dc:creator>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=907</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker chat with <a href="https://www.lizrice.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Liz Rice</a>, VP of open source engineering for <a href="https://www.aquasec.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aqua Security</a>, which provides tools to secure cloud-native deployments. </p>
<p>Liz describes Aqua&#8217;s evolution over the years: From a provider of container security to <a href="https://www.aquasec.com/news/aqua-security-cspm-cloudsploit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">its acquisition of CloudSploit</a> and its development of open-source security solutions. Most customers are using cloud native software, and Aqua wants to secure those workloads and engage that community. </p>
<p>&#8220;As a business, we have to be where the discussions are. Having open-source tools that are genuinely useful gives us a good way to participate in that community,&#8221; Liz explains. </p>
<p>In addition to her role at Aqua Security, she is the chair on the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CloudNative Computing Foundation</a>&#8216;s (CNCF) Technical Oversight Committee. During the conversation, Liz gives an overview of how they handle projects.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways 
</h2>
<ul>
<li> Open source tools offer an entry point into communities. “As a business, we have to be there — we have to be where the discussions are. And having open source tools and solutions that are genuinely useful gives us a good way of participating in that community,” Liz says of the value of Aqua developing open-source tools. The company’s Starboard toolkit for finding risks in Kubernetes workloads and environments is a recent example. </li>
<li> Liz discusses Starboard’s comparative advantage — it integrates existing Kubernetes tools, not just from Aqua but also from third-parties, into the Kubernetes experience. “You can run Trivy through Starboard and your results are right there next to the workload you&#8217;re interested in,” she says. </li>
<li> Liz discusses CNCF’s role with Kubernetes and beyond. &#8220;Google today contributes tons of time, energy, and engineering hours into Kubernetes. If tomorrow they were to decide they were going to walk away, Kubernetes still exists, and it would do so because of the CNCF and its participants,&#8221; she explains.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Resources </h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what was mentioned in the episode

<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor:</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Teleconferencing services <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/03/19/microsoft-teams-gains-12m-users-week-slack-picks-7000-new-customers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">continue to boom</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3>General News: Cloud Provider Moves to Internet for Business</h3>
<p> Business for web conferencing applications has <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/03/19/microsoft-teams-gains-12m-users-week-slack-picks-7000-new-customers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">boomed this month</a>. Microsoft Teams gained 12 million users in a week and Slack’s paid version gained over 7,000 customers since the start of February. Hopefully people continue to use these tools to stay more connected even after we’ve gotten through this pandemic.</p>
<p> With AWS testing centers closed, AWS Certification is now offering <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/faqs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">all exams online</a> with online proctoring. Considerations are being made for those who need to reschedule.</p>
<h3>AWS: Chipping Away at JEDI</h3>
<p> The price of Amazon GuardDuty use over 10,000 gigabytes (GB) was<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-guardduty-price-reduction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> reduced</a> from 25 cents to 15 cents per GB.</p>
<p> The normally quiet CloudFront announced they have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/slashing-cloudfront-change-propagation-times-in-2020-recent-changes-and-looking-forward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cut propagation times</a> down to five. Propagation times used to average between 17 and 35 minutes. CloudFront has always been cost-effective, but now it’s as efficient as it needs to be.</p>
<p> Amazon QuickSight <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-quicksight-launches-image-support-on-dashboards-and-more/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">launched image support</a> on dashboards through the insight editor. Neat, but indicative of a slow news week.</p>
<p> AWS Site-to-Site VPN <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/aws-site-to-site-vpn-now-supports-certificate-authentication-for-connections-to-aws-transit-gateway/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now enables</a> you to use digital certificates for all site-to-site connections. This is great for mobile devices or other cases without static IP addresses.</p>
<p> In our developing coverage of the JEDI contract, AWS has <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/03/24/aws-charges-pentagon-wants-give-microsoft-contested-jedi-bid/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now charged</a> that the DoD is unfairly granting Microsoft a “do-over” on flawed portions of its bid.</p>
<p> The UpdateShardCount API for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-kinesis-data-streams-now-supports-scaling-up-to-10000-mbs-throughput-with-a-single-api-call/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">]]></description>

	<title>TCP Talks: Josh Stella on How Security Automation is Changing the Game in the Cloud</title>
	<link>https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/how-security-automation-is-changing-the-game-in-the-cloud/</link>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=2411</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Josh Stella, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.fugue.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fugue</a>, a cloud security company that helps businesses run faster on the cloud without breaking any rules. </p>
<p>Josh shares insights from Fugue’s State of Cloud Security 2021 Report, and highlights key themes, including preventative security measures, automation, and engineering-first compliance. </p>
<p>According to the report, within the next two years, all but 1% of security breaches will be caused by misconfiguration of cloud resources. Josh and his team at Fugue aim to minimize these mistakes by simplifying cloud security through a systems-based approach.</p>
<p>One way to streamline security, Josh notes, is to take advantage of automation. With cloud environments becoming increasingly complex, relying on pure knowledge will soon be untenable. Josh urges business leaders to embrace automation to reduce the risk of human error in their security systems. </p>
<p>Josh also discusses how businesses can declutter security tech stacks, the “land grab” happening in the cloud, and trends he predicts will shape the future of cloud compliance. </p>
<h2>Featured Guest</h2>
<p> Name: Josh Stella </p>
<p> What he does: Josh is the co-founder and CEO at <a href="https://www.fugue.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fugue</a>, a cloud security company on a mission to help businesses move faster by ensuring safe cloud environments. He has over a decade of experience in the cloud security space, including positions at Amazon Web Services and in national security. </p>
<p> Key quote: “If Fugue as a software vendor and as domain experts in cloud security can&#8217;t make your job a lot easier through tooling, then we&#8217;re not doing our job.”</p>
<p> Where to find him: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-stella-949a9711/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/FugueHQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3ubmQ50wDpU42d3C53ntw/videos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>
<h2>Key Takeaways </h2>
<p> While compiling the State of Cloud Security 2021 Report, Josh and his team at Fugue interviewed over 300 organizations. They found that as cloud environments have grown and become more complex, organizations are seeing more instances of misconfigurations. </p>
<p>According to the report, 49% of respondents experienced over 50 misconfigurations per day. Another interesting detail: For the first time since Fugue started compiling its annual report, Identity and Access Management (IAM) was the number one concern regarding misconfigurations.</p>
<p> Josh argues that automation is the next step in making cloud environments more secure. Fugue aims to make security automation easy by providing pre-built rules and templates to automatically check code and monitor deployments. </p>
<p>Looking forward, Josh is optimistic that automation will become a key piece in enterprise cloud security. “The thing I would like to see a change in is the attitude that security problems are because people are screwing up … [I would like to see people] thinking about how to actually solve these problems, which is through computer science and automation,” he says.</p>
<p> One way to enable automation is to put engineering departments in charge of compliance, as opposed to traditional security teams. According to the State of Cloud Security 2021 Report, more than 66% of businesses are delegating security policy to engineering teams — a trend Josh hopes to see continue. </p>
<p>He says that today, engineering and DevOps teams work so fast security teams struggle to keep pace. Businesses that haven’t moved responsibility for security over to these teams are more likely to experience those potentially dangerous misconfigurations. </p>

<li> Google is no longer stuck <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/introducing-cloud-domains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 90s</a>. </li>
<li> Oracle thinks it’s ruggedly handsome — <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/02/09/538461/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">it is not</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow Up: Somebody’s In Trouble</h3>
<ul>
<li> SolarWinds hackers downloaded some Microsoft source code for <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/solarwinds-hackers-downloaded-some-microsoft-source-code-for-azure-and-exchange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Azure, Exchange and Intune</a>.

</ul>
<h3>General News: The Glowing Puck</h3>
<ul>
<li> Gartner is reporting that Low-Code development tool growth has <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/02/16/low-code-market-entering-hypergrowth-spurred-covid-says-gartner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">grown 23% this year</a>. Gartner, pay to play.  </li>

</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Jumping Back To 1994</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google introduces schedule-based autoscaling for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-schedule-based-autoscaling-for-compute-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compute Engine</a>.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Jonathan pulls a classic move from 2020 and doesn’t realize he’s on mute. Also, the team completely destroys an article about the cloud being too expensive for what you get.           </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> VC firm a16z calls the cloud a “trillion-dollar paradox” in <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a>, noting the pressure cloud computing puts on margins can start to outweigh the benefits. We think there are quite a few holes in their analysis and the Dropbox example doesn’t work.</li>
<li> AWS releases <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-workflow-studio-a-low-code-visual-tool-for-building-state-machines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Step Functions Workflow Studio</a>. Developers new to Step Functions will enjoy being able to build workflows faster. </li>
<li> Google announces that Quantum computers from IonQ <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/ionq-quantum-computer-available-through-google-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now on its marketplace</a>. Developers, researchers and enterprises alike can now access IonQ’s high-fidelity, 11-qubit system via Google Cloud.   </li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: A Trillion-Dollar Paradox </h3>
<ul>
<li> Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, known as &#8220;a16z,&#8221; thinks the cost of cloud computing <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">outweighs its benefits</a>. Dropbox is a terrible example to use in this case.  </li>
<li> Splunk launches Splunk Security Cloud and announces a billion-dollar <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/22/splunk-launches-splunk-security-cloud-nabs-1b-from-silver-lake/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">investment by a private equity firm</a>. We think it’s having some integration problems in the background — it’s something to keep an eye on.    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Jonathan, You’re On Mute</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS launches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-workflow-studio-a-low-code-visual-tool-for-building-state-machines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Step Functions Workflow Studio</a>. This is great for developers new to Step Functions as it reduces the time it takes to build their first workflow.</li>
<li> AWS invites individual developers and small teams to take <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migrate-your-workloads-with-the-graviton-challenge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Graviton Challenge</a>. They’re obviously trying to drive adoption. </li>
<li> AWS Key Management Service is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/encrypt-global-data-client-side-with-aws-kms-multi-region-keys/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">introducing multi-region keys</a>. A nuisance that has plagued Justin for years has finally been solved. </li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> If Amazon was the royal family, this would be like <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-will-return-amazon-web-services-ceo-replacing-andy-jassy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Harry becoming King</a>.</li>

<li> Azure wants to shut The Cloud Pod up <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/our-commitment-to-expand-azure-availability-zones-to-more-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for good this time</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Nothing Spicy</h3>

Interesting that it uses Cloud Custodian.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: No Longer Hiring</h3>
<ul>

<li> Introducing Amazon S3 Object Lambda. They listened to us! </li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Slurm It Up</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google Cloud <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-cloud-caps-sales-commissions-as-losses-mount" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">caps sales commissions</a> as losses mount. This will remove the motivation to go after smaller deals.  </li>

We thought it was attacking our workloads but it actually wasn’t — our bad. </li>
<li> Google is announcing the preview of its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/announcing-network-connectivity-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Connectivity Center</a>. No potatoes, thankfully.   </li>
<li> Announcing the newest set of features for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hpc/introducing-the-latest-slurm-on-gcp-scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slurm running on Google Cloud</a>. Worst name ever.  </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the whole team definitely isn’t completely exhausted. Meanwhile, Amazon releases MSK Connect, Google offers the Google Cloud Digital Leader certification, and DORA&#8217;s 2021 State of DevOps report has arrived. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li>  “From a least-privileged perspective, it&#8217;d be better to have a purpose-built tool that does one thing really well — what you need it to do — versus building out this huge AWS CLI you have to install on every server and expose attack vectors if it has the wrong permissions.”</li>
<li> “Digital transformation is such a broad thing for so many industries … and giving them this cloud knowledge helps them drive outcomes from a technical perspective, and map the business need to the technical need …  It&#8217;s helpful for [business users] to get a little bit of language, but also for the technical person to actually learn how to translate technical ideas into business ideas that have value.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: F5 Absorbs Threat Stack</h3>

<li> <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/another-deal-f5-networks-68m-acquisition-threat-stack-add-cloud-monitoring-capabilities/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">F5 sets its sights on Threat Stack</a>, paying $68 million to add this Boston-based cloud monitoring company to its growing list of cloud and security software acquisitions.

</ul>
<h3>AWS: MSK Connect – the New Easy Button for Managed Kafka Service users</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS is eliminating undifferentiated heavy lifting for users of its fully managed Apache Kafka service, by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-msk-connect-stream-data-to-and-from-your-apache-kafka-clusters-using-managed-connectors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">introducing MSK Connect</a>, which allows users to configure and deploy a connector using Kafka Connect with a few clicks. </li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-redshift-rsql-amazon-redshift-clusters-databases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Redshift users can now use RSQL</a>, a fully-featured command-line client, to interact with their clusters and databases. Working as a complement to the PostgreSQL psql command line tool, RSQL is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS X.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Anointing Future Digital Leaders</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google introduces the new <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-new-cloud-storage-trigger-eventarc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Storage trigger in Eventarc</a>, which eliminates the need for audit logs and supports bucket filtering.

<li> “I have a couple of customers that I sent this [HealthLake] press release over to, and they&#8217;re very excited. They have no idea how they want to use it yet, but they&#8217;re very excited to figure out how to do something interesting with it. So I&#8217;m really curious to see how people actually start to play with this, and figure out how to use it to be beneficial for their companies.” </li>
<li> “I was surprised that they limited the open-source UDP proxy to just gaming. I get that there&#8217;s some undifferentiated heavy lifting that is provided with session management security. But a UDP proxy that scales is something valuable to most companies that are using some legacy protocols. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see this expand a little bit to enable some other UDP use cases in the future.”</li>

<h3>General News: This Isn’t the Evidence You’re Looking For</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS Summit Online is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/online/us-canada/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">free to attend</a> on May 13. Expect to hear our predictions soon!</li>
<li> Following a partial review, the Department of Defense’s inspector general’s office <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/dod-watchdog-sanctions-jedi-award-microsoft-amazon-calls-bias-claims-unfounded/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> they have found no evidence of the DoD awarding the JEDI contract unfairly. Meanwhile, Jon Palmer, Deputy General Counsel for Microsoft argued that <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/15/dod-amazon-jedi-contract/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">allowing AWS a second bid would give Amazon an unfair advantage</a>. But who inspects the inspector?</li>
</ul>
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<ul>
<li> Verizon is breaking out the big bucks to <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/04/16/verizon-acquiring-zoom-rival-bluejeans-reported-400m/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">purchase</a> video conference company BlueJeans for $400 million. It’s interesting to see BlueJeans back in the spotlight.</li>
<li> The Information reports that AWS has been <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/aws-holds-the-line-on-cloud-bills-as-customers-ask-for-relief" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comparatively inflexible</a> on cloud bill payments compared to Azure and Google Cloud Platform. At the same time, AWS has maintained the messaging that it is “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/aws-offers-to-help-customers-facing-financial-challenges-from-covid-19.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here to help</a>” during this “unprecedented time.”</li>
</ul>
<h3> AWS: A Snowball’s Chance at the JEDI Contract</h3>
<ul>
<li> The Snowball family of devices received a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-snowball-edge-update/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ton of updates</a>. All that work on military applications and no JEDI contract to apply it to.</li>
<li> Federated querying is now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-redshift-announces-general-availability-for-federated-querying/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">generally available</a> on Amazon Redshift.

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> Microsoft releases an <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-plan-to-go-carbon-negative-raises-bar-for-tech-rivals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ambitious plan</a> to erase its carbon footprint.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> Amazon slashed prices for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/eks-price-reduction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudendure-highly-automated-disaster-recovery-80-price-reduction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">services</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> Google Cloud fights for market share as connections change with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/epic-systems-warns-customers-it-will-stop-supporting-google-cloud.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Epic</a> and <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-grows-travel-industry-presence-new-sabre-lufthansa-deals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sabre</a>.</p>
<h3>Justin’s Adventures in Oracle Cloud Revisited</h3>
<p> On <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/episode-54-gcp-puts-the-cloud-pod-on-ice/">Episode 54</a> we featured an investigative segment where Justin sought answers as to whether non-boot volume cross-region backups were available yet. And while that sleuthing was still an informative experience, Max Verun, a Product Manager at Oracle, has reached out to let us know that those answers were also in paragraph two of the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/cross-region-boot-volume-backups-for-instance-disaster-recovery,-migration,-and-expansion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">very article we linked to</a>. </p>
<p>Thanks, Max. We’d love to have you on the show sometime.</p>
<h3>Microsoft and DigitalOcean Make Major Reductions (But Not the Same Kind)</h3>
<p> Microsoft has declared an <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-plan-to-go-carbon-negative-raises-bar-for-tech-rivals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ambitious plan</a> to remove all of the carbon it has ever emitted from the atmosphere, a goal that far outstrips that of other tech giants. Currently carbon neutral, Microsoft plans to use a combination of forestation, reforestation and other carbon sequestration technologies to go carbon negative and completely remove its legacy carbon footprint.</p>
<p> DigitalOcean, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/21/digitalocean_layoffs_cloud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reducing its workforce</a> by about 10 percent with a round of layoffs. Co-founder Moisey Uretsky assured the public that the move is a strategic one, and not indicative of any sort of poor financial health.</p>
<h3>Amazon Web Services (AWS) — New Features and Price Reductions</h3>
<p>AWS announced four new features this week, starting with:</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team admits to using the podcast as a way to figure out what day it is. Justin also relents and includes Azure news because he couldn’t handle any more Oracle mobile apps announcements. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Social media influencers can breathe <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-arrests-man-for-plan-to-kill-70-percent-of-internet-in-aws-bomb-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a sigh of relief</a>. </li>
<li> Amazon is dangling a carrot in front of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-managed-service-for-grafana-now-supports-grafana-enterprise-upgrade-grafana-version-7-5-open-distro-for-elasticsearch-integration-and-aws-billing-reports/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">one of its partners</a>. </li>
<li> Azure is throwing a spanner <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/tracking-index-backfill-operation-progress-cloud-spanner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the works</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Not Cool News</h3>
<ul>
<li> The FBI arrests a man for his plan to kill “70% of the internet” in an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-arrests-man-for-plan-to-kill-70-percent-of-internet-in-aws-bomb-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS bomb attack</a>. 70% is quite a stretch but we’re sure it would have caused a crappy day for a lot of people.  </li>
<li> Hashicorp has released its Boundary 0.2 release <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/boundary-0-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">with several new features</a>. We’re really excited about this. </li>
<li> Announcing HashiCorp Terraform <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-terraform-0-15-general-availability" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">0.15 General Availability</a>. If you believe it, this is really great news. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Good At Compromising</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces AQUA is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aqua-advanced-query-accelerator-for-amazon-redshift/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a>. Justin should have gotten a prediction point for this one.  </li>
<li> Amazon Managed Service for Grafana now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-managed-service-for-grafana-now-supports-grafana-enterprise-upgrade-grafana-version-7-5-open-distro-for-elasticsearch-integration-and-aws-billing-reports/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">offers more support</a>. We’ll see if Grafana can actually make money out of its partnership with Amazon.</li>
<li> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-rds-postgresql-integrates-aws-lambda/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">integrates with AWS Lambda</a>. This is really cool! </li>
<li> Decrease machine learning costs with instance price reductions and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/slash-your-machine-learning-costs-with-instance-price-reductions-and-savings-plans-for-amazon-sagemaker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">savings plans for Amazon SageMaker</a>. Some pretty significant savings here.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Colossal</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google takes a deep dive into its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scalable storage solution, Colossus</a>. Nothing new here. </li>

<h2>General News </h2>
<p>01:46 <a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/what-salesforces-8b-acquisition-of-informatica-means-for-enterprise-data-and-ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">What Salesforce&#8217;s $8B acquisition of Informatica means for enterprise data </a><a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/what-salesforces-8b-acquisition-of-informatica-means-for-enterprise-data-and-ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">and AI | VentureBeat</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> just dropped $8 billion to acquire <a href="https://www.informatica.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Informatica</a>. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This purchase was really about building the data foundation needed for agentic AI to actually work in enterprise environments &#8211; we&#8217;re talking about combining Informatica&#8217;s 30 years of data management expertise with Salesforce&#8217;s cloud platform to create what they&#8217;re calling a &#8220;unified architecture for agentic AI.&#8221;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This acquisition fills a massive gap in Salesforce&#8217;s data management capabilities, bringing in critical pieces like data cataloging, integration, governance, quality controls, and master data management &#8211; all the unsexy but absolutely essential plumbing that makes AI agents trustworthy and scalable in real enterprise deployments.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The timing here is fascinating, because Informatica literally just announced their own agentic AI offerings last week at <a href="https://www.informaticaworld.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Informatica World</a>, so Salesforce is essentially buying a company that&#8217;s already pivoted hard into the AI space &#8211; rather than trying to build these capabilities from scratch.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">There&#8217;s going to be some interesting overlap with <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MuleSoft</a>, which Salesforce bought for $6.5 billion back in 2018, but analysts are s]]></description>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Claude has launched the latest models in <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Claude Opus 4</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Claude Sonnet 4</a>, setting new standards for coding, advancing reasoning and AI agents. Maybe they’ll actually follow instructions when told to shut down? (Looking at you, ChatGPT.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Claude Opus 4 is “the world’s best coding model” with sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Opus 4 has 350 billion parameters, making it one of the largest publicly available language models. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It demonstrates strong performance on academic benchmarks, including research. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sonnet 4 is a smaller 10 billion parameter model optimized for dialogue, making it well-suited for conversational AI applications. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Alongside the <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">models</a>, they are also announcing:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Extended thinking with tool use (beta): Both models can use tools &#8211; like <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/web-search-tool" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">web search</a> &#8211; during extended thinking, allowing Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool use to improve its responses.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">New Model Capabilities: Both models can use tools in parallel, follow instructions more precisely, and when given access to local files by developers &#8212; demonstrate significantly improved memory capabilities, extracting and saving key facts maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://jules.google/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jules</a> is an autonomous AI agent that can read code, understand intent, and make code changes on its own. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It goes beyond AI coding assistants to operate independently.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It clones code into a secure Google Cloud VM, allowing it to understand the full context of a project. This enables it to write tests, build features, fix bugs, and more.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Jules operates asynchronously in the background, presenting its plan and reasoning when complete. This allows developers to focus on other tasks while it works.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Integration with <a href="https://github.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> enables Jules to work directly in existing workflows without extra setup or context switching. Developers can steer and give feedback throughout the process.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For cloud developers, Jules demonstrates the rapid advancement of AI for coding moving from prototype to product. Its cloud-based parallel execution enables efficient handling of complex, multi-file changes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">While in public beta, Jules is free with some usage limits. This allows developers to experiment with this cutting-edge AI coding agent and understand its potential to accelerate development on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a>.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 304 of The Cloud Pod &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! Justin, Ryan and Matt are in the house tonight to bring you all the latest and greatest in Cloud and AI news, including AWS new Chilean region, the ongoing tug of war between Open AI and Microsoft, and even some K8 updates &#8211; plus an aftershow. Let’s get started! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open AI gets a COO delivered</li>
<li>Things get Chile with new regions</li>
<li>Observability and AI, I Q-uestion the logic</li>
<li>Cloud Pod tries to Microsoft Build predictions</li>
<li>K8 resizes pods on the fly</li>
<li>Microsoft strongly reinforces the AI Foundry</li>
<li>The Cloud Pod renegotiates the hosts&#8217; contracts … we now have to pay the Cloud Pod to be on it </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We previously talked about the DOJ and <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=1dce9f7d9dd3eb415f6ac5f5f4a1f909643a18c2caf414d4ac2d34e3e1504a52JmltdHM9MTc0NzY5OTIwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=0a813a60-1d44-6490-24a2-2fa21caa6502&amp;psq=google&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;ntb=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google</a> Antitrust lawsuit &#8211; and now the DOJ has wrapped up their <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-apr-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">remedies hearing</a>, and Google has *not* been quiet about it.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">One of the claims is that the remedies would hurt browser choice, putting browsers like Firefox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660548/firefox-google-search-revenue-share-doj-antitrust-remedies" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">out of business</a> completely. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Google also claimed that data disclosure mandates would threaten user’s privacy &#8211; it would be MUCH safer if they could just sell it to you via their marketplace. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We do agree that divesting Chrome would make things more complicated for people living in the Google Cloud. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Really, what comes down to is that Google claims DOJ’s solutions are the wrong solutions &#8211; although to us, Google’s solutions aren’t much better. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 303 of The Cloud Pod &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! Justin, Ryan and exhausted dad Matt are here (and mostly awake) ready to bring the latest in cloud news! This week we’ve got more news from Nova, updates to Claude, earnings news, and a mini funeral for Skype &#8211; plus a new helping of Cloud Journey!</p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Claude researches so Ryan can nap</li>
<li>The best AI for Nova Corps, Amazon Nova Premiere JB</li>
<li>If you can’t beat them, change the licensing terms and make them fork, and then </li>
<li>     reverse course… and profit</li>
<li>Q has invaded your IDE!!</li>
<li>Skype bites the dust</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">OpenAI wrote up a blog post about their sycophantic <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=3fc129c3812975421c5d14a2d2ca757c9dfa520a03d0c568fdb1c58e86512029JmltdHM9MTc0NzAwODAwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=0a813a60-1d44-6490-24a2-2fa21caa6502&amp;psq=gpt-4o&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuYWkuY29tL2luZGV4L2hlbGxvLWdwdC00by8&amp;ntb=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chat GPT 4o</a> upgrade last week, and they wanted to set the record straight. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They made adjustments at improving the models default personality to make it feel more intuitive and effective across a variety of tasks. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">When shaping model behavior, they start with a baseline principle and instructions outlined in their model spec. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They also teach their models how to apply these principles by incorporating user signals like thumbs up and thumbs down feedback on responses. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In this update, though, they focused too much on short-term feedback and did not fully account for how users&#8217; interactions with ChatGPT evolve. This skewed the results towards responses that were overly supportive &#8211; but disingenuous. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Beyond rolling back the changes, they are taking steps to realign the model behavior, including refining core training techniques and system prompts to explicitly steer the model away from sycophancy. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They also plan to build more guardrails to increase honesty and transparency principles in the model spec.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Additionally, they plan to expand ways for users to test and give direct feedback before deployments.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Lastly, OpenAI continues to expand evaluations building on the model sync and our ongoing research. </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Yes, they&#8217;re grabbing money and screwing you. Basically. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 302 of The Cloud Pod &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! This week Justin and Ryan are on hand to bring you all the latest in Cloud (and AI news.) We’ve got hotpatching, Project Greenland, and a rollback of GPT-4.o, which sort of makes us sad &#8211; and our egos are definitely less stroked. Plus Saas, containers, and outposts &#8211; all of this and more. Thanks for joining us in the cloud! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Cloud Pod was never accused of being sycophantic</li>
<li>2nd Gen outposts!?! I didn’t even know anyone was using Gen 1</li>
<li>AWS Outposts 2nd Gen… not with AI (GASP)</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re doing SaaS wrong, Google &amp; AWS have your back this week with new Features </li>
<li>Patching, so hot right now</li>
<li>Larger container sizes for Azure….  You don’t say</li>
<li>AWS Green reporting detects hotspots… surprisingly close to Maryland…..</li>
<li>Visual pipeline for Opensearch… I want to like this… but I just can’t</li>

<h2>General News </h2>
<p>01:37 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/sharing-new-dora-research-for-gen-ai-in-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing new DORA research for gen AI in software development</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The DORA team at Google has released a new report, “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/content/dora-impact-of-gen-ai-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impact of Generative AI In Software Development</a>.” The report is based on data and developer interviews, and the report aims to move beyond hype to offer a proper perspective on AI&#8217;s impact on individuals, teams and organizations. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Click on the link in our show notes to access the full report. However, Google has highlighted a few key points in the blog post.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">AI is Real &#8211; A staggering 89% of organizations are prioritizing the integration of AI into their applications, and 76% of technologists are already using AI in some part of their daily work. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Productivity gains confirmed: Developers using Gen AI report significant increases in flow, productivity, and job satisfaction.  For instance, a 25% increase in AI adoption is associated with a 2.1% increase in individual productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Organization benefits are tangible: Beyond individual gains, Dora found strong correlations between AI adoption and improvements in crucial organizational metrics. A 25% increase in AI adoption is associated with increases in document quality, code quality, code review speeds and approval speeds. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If you are looking to utilize AI in your development organization, they provide five practical approaches for both leaders and practitioners.
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Have transparent communications</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Empower developers with learning and experimentation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Establish clear policies</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Rethink performance metrics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Embrace fast feedback loops</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>045:06  Ryan &#8211; “Those are really good approaches, but really difficult to implement in practice. You know, in my day job, watching the company struggle to get a handle on AI from all the different angles you need to, from data protection, legal liability]]></description>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://openai.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> is embracing Anthropic’s standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where the data resides.  </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">MCP is an open source standard that helps AI models produce better, more relevant responses to certain queries. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sam Altman says that people love MCP and they are excited to add support across their products and that it is available today in the Agents SDK and support for the ChatGPT desktop and Response API is coming soon.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">MCP lets models draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In what we swear is the 9th death for Skype, Microsoft has announced that after 21 years (with 13 of those years under MS Control,) Skype will be no more. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For real this time. Really. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">May 5th is the official last day of Skype, and they’ve indicated you can continue your calls and chats in Teams. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Starting now, you should be able to use your Skype login to get into Teams. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For those of you who do this, you’ll see all your existing contacts and chats in Teams. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Alternatively, you can export your Skype data, specifically contacts, call history and chats. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Current subscribers to Skype Premium services will remain active until the end, but you will not be able to sign up for Skype at this time. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Skype dial pad credits will remain active in the web interface and inside Teams after May 5th so you can finish using those credits. </li>
</ul>
<p>03:37  Matthew  &#8211; “I think there&#8217;s a lot of people and, you know, at least people I know in other countries to still use Skype, like pretty heavily for like cross country communications, things along those lines. So I think a lot of that is that there probably is still a good amount of people using it. And this is just, Hey, they&#8217;re trying to make it nicely. So how, you know, nice and clean cut over for people versus, you know, the Apple method of it just doesn&#8217;t work anymore. Good luck.”</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">One of the early concerns about <a href="https://deepseek.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DeepSeek</a> was its privacy implications, starting with their <a href="https://platform.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Allegations are significant but reality is if the open source model is hosted locally or orchestrated via GPUs in the US the data does not go to China.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">But if you&#8217;re using the DeepSeek app it clearly states in the privacy policy that the data will be stored in China. Data hosted on Chinese servers can be seized by the Government at any time. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Maybe rethink using the native DeepSeek websites and mobile apps and just host them locally in LM studio. </li>
</ul>
<p>02:21  Jonathan &#8211; “They&#8217;re collecting some weird data. I get collecting conversational data, because that is the business they’re in, but they’re also doing some weird stuff, like they fingerprint users by looking at the patterns of the way that they type. Not just what they type, but how they type, like the timing between hitting different letters &#8211; things like that.”</p>

</ul>
<p>02:23  Jonathan &#8211; “Inference cost is really the big driver there. So once you once you build something that&#8217;s that&#8217;s done, but it&#8217;s nice to see somebody focusing on delivering it as a service rather than, you know, a $50 an hour compute for training models.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If you don’t want to hand over all your money to the cloud providers, you will be able to hand over $3,000 dollars to Nvidia… for a computer that is probably going to be obsolete in &lt;12 months. That’s fun! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The new personal AI supercomputer, called <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/project-digits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Project Digits</a>, will launch in May. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The heart of Digits is the new GB10 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grace Blackwell Superchip</a>, which packs enough processing power to run sophisticated AI models, while being compact enough to fit on a desk and run from a standard power outlet.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Digits can handle AI models with up to 200 billion parameters, and looks very similar to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mac Mini</a>. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">“AI will be mainstream in every application for every industry. With Project Digits, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-puts-grace-blackwell-on-every-desk-and-at-every-ai-developers-fingertips" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said in a press release</a>. “Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The Digits system comes with 128gb of unified coherent memory and up to 4tb of NVME storage.  For even more demanding apps, two digit systems can be linked together to handle models with 405b parameters. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The GB10 chip delivers up to 1 petaflop of AI performance, meaning it can perform 1 quadrillion AI calculations per second. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Suppose you plunk down the money for Digits. In that case, you will also get access to Nvidia&#8217;s AI software library, including development kits, orchestration tools and pre-trained models available through the Nvidia NGC catalog. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The system runs on a Linux-based NVidia NGC catalog, and supports popular frameworks like <a href="https://pytorch.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jupyter</a> notebooks. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 286 of The Cloud Pod &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! Welcome to the final show of 2024! We thank you for joining us on our cloud journey over the past year. During this last show of the year, we look back on all the tech that changed our jobs and lives, and make predictions for an AI filled 2025. Join Justin, Jonathan, Ryan, and Matthew as they look forward to even more discussions about undersea cables. Happy New Year! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We thought 2024 would never end</li>
<li>I can sum up 2024 &#8211; AI AI AI AI and uhh AI</li>
<li>AI has taken over the Cloud Pod &#8211; we are not really here</li>
<li>2024 the year we hoped AI would replace us… close but not yet</li>

<h2>General News</h2>
<h2>00:31   2024 Predictions Look Back</h2>
<p>Matt</p>
<ul>
<li>Simpler and Easier to access LLM with new services</li>
<li>Kubernetes will become simpler for smaller companies to operate that doesn’t require Highly Paid Devops/Scientists</li>
<li>Low Employee Churn Rates and increased Tenure (Quiet Quitting)</li>
</ul>
<p>02:07  Matthew &#8211; “How is it simpler and easier? I think that there are more ways to run it. The general public has an easier way to access it. And they are simpler as Justin said that they are becoming easier and more efficient and better to use for the average user. So I know that I talked to many people that I work with now and just in general and people that are not in tech, which I feel like a year ago.”</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be mass layoffs in tech directly attributed to AI in Q1 2024 (10k or more)</li>
<li>Someone will start a cult that follows an AI LLM God believing in sentience, a higher power. </li>
<li>AI will find a new home in education. Lesson Plans, Personalized Learning plans by students, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>02:07  Jonathan &#8211; “Well, there is a religion called the First Church of Artificial Intelligence, but it&#8217;s been around for longer than this year. I think it&#8217;s like five, six years old at this point. So that&#8217;s kind of cheating.</p>
<p>Ryan</p>
<ul>
<li>Start seeing the financial impact of AI to better profitability by using AI.</li>
<li>AI Solution tied towards new employee onboarding (replace wiki technology)</li>
<li>Removal of stateful firewalls as traffic ruleset (next-gen next-gen firewall)</li>
</ul>
<p>02:07  Ryan &#8211; “I mean, agentic AI is something that&#8217;s been rolled out in a lot of companies. I know in my day job, it&#8217;s been rolled out. I hope to see this get even stronger and more obvious just because I think that, you know, the days of searching through thousands of documents or the one, you know, unmaintained team page that someone built three years ago when they were new are over. And so I&#8217;d like to see this continue.</p>
<p>Justin</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">LLM will hit the trough of disillusionment either on Cost, Environmental impact or people realizing how limited these models are</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Another AI model other than Transformer based</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We will see another large defector from Public Cloud (not 37 Signals or X/Twitter)</li>
</ol>
<p>13:26  Justin &#8211; “I feel partially vindicated that I was sort of right, just I thought we didn&#8217;t be in the trough a little faster, but maybe it&#8217;s coming still. I don&#8217;t know. they&#8217;re innovating pretty quickly. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll get there, but definitely environmental is going to become a big, big conversation around AI.”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We’re just glad to see this one finally, because having it built in directly to the console to guarantee that EBS snapshots make it to the other region is a big quality of life enhancement.</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Elwoods Edwards, the voice behind the online service <a href="https://www.aol.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AOL</a>’s iconic “You’ve got mail” sound notification has died at the age of 74. He was just one day shy of his 75th birthday. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The “you’ve got mail” soundbite started in 1989 when Steve Case, CEO of Quantum Computer Services (which will later become America Online or AOL,) wanted to add a human voice to their Quantum online service.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Karen Edwards, who worked as a customer service representative, heard Case discussing the plan and suggested her husband Elwood, a professional broadcaster. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Edwards recorded the famous phrase and others (&#8220;Welcome&#8221; &#8220;File’s done&#8221; and &#8220;Goodbye&#8221; among them) on a cassette recorder in his living room. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">He was paid $200 for the service.  </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The commission voted it down 2-1 </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">FERC chairman Willie Phillips said that the commission should encourage the development of data centers and semiconductor manufacturing as national security and economic development priorities.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Commissioners Mark Christie and Lindsay See (both R) voted to reject the proposal, while Davis Rosner and Judy Change (D) didn’t vote. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Talen Energy, who signed the agreement, drew challenges from neighboring utilities AEP and Exelon &#8211; who challenged the novel arrangement, arguing it would unfairly shift costs of running the broader grid to other consumers. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">FERC’s order found the region&#8217;s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, failed to show why the proposal was necessary and prove such a deal would be limited to the Susquehanna plant given the widespread interest in placing data centers next to power plants. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Talen said the ruling would have a chilling effect on the region&#8217;s economic development and it is weighing its options. </li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.delta.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Delta</a> isn’t backing down with <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CrowdStrike</a>, and in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Delta-v-CrowdStrike-Complaint-10-25-24.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">court filing</a> said CrowdStrike should be on the hook for the entire $500M in losses, partly because CrowdStrike has admitted that it should have done more testing and staggered deployments to catch bugs. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Delta further alleges that CrowdStrike postured as a certified best-in-class security provider who “never cuts corners,” while secretly designing its software to bypass Microsoft security certifications to make changes at the core of Delta’s computer systems without Delta’s knowledge. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Delta says they would never have agreed to such a dangerous process if it had been disclosed. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In its testimony to Congress, CrowdStrike said that they follow standard protocols, and that they are protecting against threats as they evolve.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">CrowdStrike is also accusing Delta of failing to follow laws, including best practices established by the TSA.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">According to CrowdStrike, most customers were up within a day of the issue &#8211; while Delta took 5 days. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Crowdstrike alleges that Delta’s negligence caused this in following the TSA requirements designed to ensure that no major airline ever experiences prolonged system outages. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">CrowdStrike realized Delta failed to follow the requirements when its efforts to help remediate the issue revealed alleged technological shortcomings and failures to follow security best practices, including outdated IT systems, issues in Delta’s AD environment and thousands of compromised passwords.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Delta threatened to sue Microsoft as well as CrowdStrike, but has only named CrowdStrike to date in the lawsuits. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 280 of The Cloud Pod, where the forecast is always cloudy! This week Justin, Jonathan, Ryan, and Matthew are your hosts as we travel through the latest in cloud news. This week we’re talking more about nuclear power, some additional major employee shakeups, Claude releases, plus saying RIP to CloudWatch Evidently and hello to Azure Cobalt VMs.  </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The cloud providers are colluding on Nuclear Power</li>
<li>I fear our AWS AI nightmare might get worse without Dr. Matt Wood.</li>
<li>I’m a glow with excitement about nuclear cloud power</li>
<li>Plainly no one else knew what “CloudWatch Evidently” did either</li>
<li>We sing a Claude Sonnet about Nuclear Power</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-evidently/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Evidently</a>, The Cloud Pod was always right</li>
<li>Amazon goes nuclear while their AI VP goes AWOL</li>

<h2>AI Is Going Great &#8211; Or How ML Makes All It’s Money  </h2>
<p>00:53 <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Anthropic is announcing the upgraded <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> and a new Model Claude 3.5 Haiku. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers across the board improvements over its predecessor, with particularly significant gains in coding &#8212; an area where it already leads the field (per anthropic).  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Claude 3.5 Haiku interestingly matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus, the prior largest model, on many evaluations at the same cost and similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Claude 3.5 Sonnet also includes a groundbreaking new capability in beta: Computer Use.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Available today as an API</a>, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do &#8211; by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons and typing text.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Claude 3.5 is the first frontier AI model to offer this capability. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Anthropic warns the feature is still <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">experimental</a> &#8211; at times cumbersome and error-prone. As well as things that are effortless for a human are still difficult including scrolling, dragging or zooming.   </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The idea is to make Claude complete individual tasks, without always needing to leverage an API, like clicking in a GUI, or uploading a file from a computer.  These types of solutions are typically found in Build and Test like scenarios with tools such as Saucelabs or Browserstack. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">To do this, Claude was built to perceive and interact with computer interfaces. You can use data from my computer to fill out this online form or check a spreadsheet, move the cursor to a web browser, navigate to the relevant web pages, select the data for the spreadsheet and so on. </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Rumors have been running wild since her last day on October 4th, with several people reporting that there has been a lot of churn. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Speculation is that Murati may join former Open AI VP Bret Zoph at his new startup.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It may be easy to steal some people, as the research organization at Open AI is reportedly in upheaval after Liam Fedus&#8217;s promotion to lead post-training &#8211; several researchers have asked to switch teams. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In addition, Ilya Sutskever, an Open AI co-founder and former chief scientist, also has a new startup.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We’ll definitely be keeping an eye on this particular soap opera. </li>
</ul>
<p>2:00  Jonathan &#8211; “I kind wonder what will these other startups bring that&#8217;s different than what OpenAI are doing or Anthropic or anybody else. mean, they&#8217;re all going to be taking the same training data sets because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s available. It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re going to invent some data from somewhere else and have an edge. I mean, I guess they could do different things like be mindful about licensing.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 278 of The Cloud Pod, where the forecast is always cloudy! When Justin’s away, the guys will… maybe get a show recorded? This week, we’re talking OpenAI, another service scheduled for the grave over at AWS, saying goodbye to pesky IPv4 fees, Azure FXv2 VMs, Valkey 8.0 and so much more! Thanks for joining us, here in the cloud! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>

<li>Another One Bites the Dust</li>
<li>Peak AI reached: OpenAI Now Puts Print Statements in Code to Help You Debug</li>
</ul>
<h3>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor: <a href="https://shortclick.link/uthdi1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Archera</a></h3>
<p>There are a lot of cloud cost management tools out there. But only Archera provides cloud commitment insurance. It sounds fancy but it&#8217;s really simple. Archera gives you the cost savings of a 1 or 3 year AWS Savings Plan with a commitment as short as 30 days. If you don&#8217;t use all the cloud resources you&#8217;ve committed to, they will literally put money back in your bank account to cover the difference. Other cost management tools may say they offer &#8220;commitment insurance&#8221;, but remember to ask: will you actually give me my money back? Archera will. <a href="https://shortclick.link/uthdi1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Click this link to check them out</a></p>
<h2>AI Is Going Great &#8211; Or How ML Makes All It’s Money</h2>
<p>00:59 <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-vision-to-the-fine-tuning-api/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introducing vision to the fine-tuning API</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">OpenAI has announced the integration of vision capabilities into its fine-tuning API, allowing developers to enhance the GPT-4o model to analyze and interpret images alongside text and audio inputs. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This update broadens the scope of applications for AI, enabling more multimodal interactions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The fine-tuning API now supports image inputs, which means developers can train models to understand and generate content based on visual data in conjunction with text and audio.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">After October 31, 2024, training for fine-tuning will cost $25 per 1 million tokens, with inference priced at $3.75 per 1 million input tokens and $15 per 1 million output tokens. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Images are tokenized based on size before pricing. The introduction of prompt caching and other efficiency measures could lower the operational costs for businesses deploying AI solutions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The API is also being enhanced to include features like epoch-based checkpoint creation, a comparative playground for model evaluation, and integration with third-party platforms like Weights and Biases for detailed fine-tuning data management.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What does it mean? Admit it &#8211; you’re dying to know. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Developers can now create applications that not only process text or voice but also interpret and generate responses based on visual cues, and importantly fine tuned for domain specific applications, and this update could lead to more intuitive user interfaces in applications, where users can interact with services using images as naturally as they do with text or speech, potentially expanding the user base to those less tech-savvy or in fields where visual data is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p>03:53  Jonathan &#8211; “I mean, I think it&#8217;s useful for things like quality assurance in manufacturing, for example. You know, could, you could tune it on what your nuts and bolts are supposed to look like and what a good bolt looks like and what a bad bolt looks like coming out of the factory.

<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>00:28 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/stability-ais-best-image-generating-models-now-in-amazon-bedrock/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stability AI’s best image generating models now in Amazon Bedrock</a> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If you are like The CloudPod hosts, the part you care most about AI is the rapid ability to create graphics for any meme-worthy moment or funny pictures for that group chat. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Luckily AWS has access to the latest image generation capability with 3 models from <a href="https://stability.ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stability AI</a>.
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Stable Image Ultra &#8211; Produces the highest quality, photorealistic outputs perfect for professional print media and large format applications. Stable image Ultra excels at rendering exceptional detail and realism. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Stable diffusion 3 large &#8211; strikes a balance between generation speed and output quality. Ideal for creating high-volume, high-quality digital assets for websites, newsletters and marketing materials. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Stable Image Core &#8211; Optimized for fast and affordable image generation, great for rapidly iterating on concepts during ideation. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">One of the key improvements of Stable Image Ultra and Stable Diffusion 3 large compared to Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) is text quality in generated images, with fewer errors in spelling and typography thanks to innovation diffusion transformer architecture, which implements two separate sets of weights for image and text but enables information flow between the two modalities. </li>

Like, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a lamp and all of a sudden it&#8217;s on a thing and they&#8217;re like, Hmm, that doesn&#8217;t look like a real photo though. It looks like AI. So you do notice it more and more.”</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Shay Banon is pleased to call <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ElasticSearc</a>h and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kibana</a> “open source” again.  He says everyone at Elastic is ecstatic to be open source again, it&#8217;s part of his and “Elastics DNA.” </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They&#8217;re doing this by adding AGPL as another license option next to ELv2 and SSPL in the coming weeks. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They never stopped believing or behaving like an OSS company after they changed the license, but by being able to use the term open source and by using AGPL &#8211; an OSI approved license &#8211; removes any questions or fud people might have. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Shay says the change 3 years ago was because they had <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-aws" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">issues with AWS</a> and the market confusion their offering was causing. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">So, after trying all the other options, changing the license &#8211; all while knowing it would result in a fork with a different name &#8211; was the path they took. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">While it was painful, they said it worked. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">3 years later, Amazon is fully invested in their OpenSearch fork, the market confusion has mostly gone, and their partnership with AWS is stronger than ever.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">They are even being named partner of the year with AWS. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They want to “make life of our users as simple as possible,” so if you&#8217;re ok with the ELv2 or the SSPL, then you can keep using that license. They aren’t removing anything, just giving you another option with AGPL.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">He calls out trolls and people who will pick at this announcement, so they are attempting to address the trolls in advance. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">“Changing the license was a mistake, and Elastic now backtracks from it”. We removed a lot of market confusion when we changed our license 3 years ago. And because of our actions, a lot has changed. It’s an entirely different landscape now. We aren’t living in the past. We want to build a better future for our users. It’s because we took action then, that we are in a position to take action now.</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Terraform is announcing the GA of <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Terraform AzureRM provider 4.0</a>.  The new version improves the extensibility and flexibility in the provider. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Since the Providers&#8217; Last major release in March 2022, Hashi has added support for some 340 resources and 120 data sources, bringing the total Azure resources to 1,101 resources and almost 360 data sources. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The provider has topped 660M downloads, MS and Hashi continue to develop new, innovative integrations that further ease the cloud adoption journey to enterprise organizations. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">With <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-8-improves-extensibility-with-provider-defined-functions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Terraform 1.8</a>, providers can implement custom functions that you can call from the Terraform configuration. The new provider adds two Azure-specific provider functions to let users correct the casing of their resource IDs or access the individual components of it. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Previously, the Azure RM provider took an all-or-nothing approach to Azure resource provider registration, where the Terraform provider would either attempt to register a fixed set of 68 providers upon initialization or registration or be skipped. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This didn’t match Microsoft&#8217;s recommendations, which are to register resource providers only as needed, and to enable the services you’re actively using. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">With adding two new feature flags, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/4.0-upgrade-guide#resource_provider_registrations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">resource_provider_registrations</a> and <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/4.0-upgrade-guide#resource_providers_to_register" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">resource_providers_to_register</a>, users now have more control over which providers to register automatically or whether to continue managing a subscription resources provider. </li>

<p>12:06  Justin &#8211; “&#8230;their mitigations don&#8217;t have any dates on them of when they&#8217;re going to be done or implemented, which, in addition to a timeline, it would be nice to see in this process.”</p>

All this and more news, right now on the Cloud Pod! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The antivirus strikes back</li>
<li>The return of the crowdstrike</li>
<li>The cloud pod is worth more than 23B</li>
<li>The cloud pod is rebranded to the AI podcast</li>
<li>The cloud pod might need to move to another git provider</li>

<li>Amazon still needs to work on it’s end user messaging</li>
<li>The CloudPod goes into hibernation before the next crisis hits</li>

<h2>Follow Up</h2>
<p>01:33 In what feels suspiciously like an SNL skit, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crowdstrike-sends-partners-uber-eats-gift-cards-after-mass-outage-2024-7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CrowdStrike sent its partners $10 Uber Eats gift cards as an apology for mass IT outage</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">As you can imagine, Twitter (or X) had thoughts. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Turns out they were just for third party partners that were helping with implementation. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">2024 Economics wants to know &#8211; what are you going to do with only $10 with Uber Eats? </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Crowdstrike: Preliminary Post Incident Review</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Moving on to the actual story &#8211; The Preliminary Post Incident Review (PIR) is now out for the BSOD Crowdstrike event we talked about last week.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Crowdstrike reports that a Rapid Response Content Update for the Falcon sensor was published to Windows hosts running sensor version 7.11 and above. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The update was to gather telemetry on new threat techniques that targeted named pipes in the kernel but instead triggered a BSOD on systems online from 4:09 &#8211; 5:27 UTC.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ultimately, the crash occurred due to undetected content during validation checks, which resulted in an out-of-bounds memory read. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">To avoid this, Crowdstrike plans to do a bunch of things:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Improve rapid response content testing by using testing types such as Local developer, content update and rollback, stress, fuzzing, fault injection, stability and content interface testing. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Introduce additional validation checks in the content validator to prevent similar issues. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Strengthen error handling mechanisms in the Falcon sensor to ensure errors from problematic content are managed gracefully.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Adopt staggered deployment strategies, starting with a canary deployment to a small subset of systems before further staged rollouts</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Enhanced sensor and system performance monitoring during the staggered content deployment to identify and mitigate issues promptly.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Allowing a granular section of when and where these updates are deployed will give customers greater contro]]></description>

<h2>General News</h2>
<p>00:58 You Guessed It &#8211; Crowdstrike </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/19/windows-outage-crowdstrike-cancellations-computer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft, CrowdStrike outage disrupts travel and business worldwide</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/our-statement-on-todays-outage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Our Statement on Today’s Outage</a>   (listener note: paywall article) </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It&#8217;s not every day you get to experience one of the largest IT Outages in history,  and it even impacted our recording of the show last week.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Crowdstrike, a popular EDR solution caused major disruption to the worlds IT systems with an errant update to their software that caused servers to BSOD, disrupting travel (airplanes, trains, etc), governments, news organizations and more.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Crowdstrike removed the errant file quickly, but still the damage was done with tons of systems requiring manual intervention to be recovered.
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">The fix required booting into safe mode, and removing a file from the crowdstrike directory.
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3">This was all complicated by bitlocker and lack of local admin rights for many end user devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Sometimes doing up to 15 reboots would bring the server back to life.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Swinging the hard drives from one broken server to a working server manually removes the files and puts them back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The issue also caused a large-scale outage in the Azure Central region.   
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">In addition to services on AWS being impacted that run Windows (Amazon is a well-known large Crowdstrike customer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Crowdstrike CEO Goerge Kurtz (who happened to be the CTO at Mcafee during the 2010 Update Fiasco that impacted Mcafee clients globally) stated that he was deeply sorry and vowed to make sure every customer is fully recovered. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">By the time of this recording, most clients should be mostly fixed and recovered, and we are all anxiously waiting to hear how this could have happened. </li>
</ul>
<p>04:50  Justin &#8211; “It&#8217;s really an Achilles heel of the cloud. I mean, to fix this, you need to be able to boot a server into safe mode or into recovery mode and then remove this file manually, which requires that you have console access, which, you know, Amazon just added a couple of years ago.”</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Here&#8217;s a bit of tech nostalgia meets modernization for you! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Japan&#8217;s government has finally phased out the use of floppy disks in all its systems. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The Digital Agency has scrapped over 1,000 regulations related to their use, marking a significant step in their efforts to update government technology.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Digital Minister Taro Kono, who&#8217;s been on a mission to modernize Japan&#8217;s government tech, announced this victory last week. It&#8217;s part of a larger push to digitize Japan&#8217;s notoriously paper-heavy bureaucracy, which became glaringly apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Japan&#8217;s digitization efforts have hit some bumps along the way, including issues with a contact-tracing app and slow adoption of their digital ID system. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It&#8217;s a reminder that modernizing legacy systems isn&#8217;t just about replacing old hardware &#8211; it&#8217;s a complex process that involves changing long-standing processes and especially mindsets.</li>
</ul>
<p>02:36  Jonathan &#8211; “Yeah, I remember a couple of years ago they started talking about this modernization they were doing and people started to panic because Japan&#8217;s the largest purchaser of floppy disks anymore, or three and a half inch disks anyway. And so I ended up buying some because I&#8217;ve still got a USB floppy drive and some machines that have floppy disks. And I wanted just to stock up on some for the future, just in case the price went through the roof if Japan finally cut them and they have.”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">One of the key takeaways from the survey is that the path to cloud maturity increasingly relies on platform teams to help automate and systemize cloud operations.

<h2>General News</h2>
<p>01:40 <a href="https://x.finops.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Finops X</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Recently Justin attended FinOps in beautiful and sunny San Diego &#8211; and if you weren’t there, you really should plan on attending next year. This year’s topics included:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Focus 1.0</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">State of Vendors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Conference size &#8211; they will most likely outgrow this particular conference center, seeing as how they’re either selling out or pretty close to it. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Coolest thing about the conference &#8211; on stage all the biggies &#8211; TOGETHER. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">It’s great to see them all together talking about how they’re making Finops better, and introducing new things for Finops and not just saving them for their own conferences. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Next Year  &#8211; Is Oracle going to be on stage next year? </li>
</ul>
<p>08:22  Justin &#8211; “The shift left of FinOps was a big topic. You know, how do we get visibility? How do we show people what things are going to cost? How do we make sure that, you know, people are aware of what they&#8217;re doing? And so I think, you know, it&#8217;s just a recognition that is important and just as important as security is your cost. And in some ways security is part of your cost story. Because if you bankrupt your company, that&#8217;s a pretty bad security situation.”</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Listen. We don’t really *care* about OpenSearch &#8211; but the reality is it’s taking over the world. Nobody is doing ElasticSearch anymore. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Digital Ocean is launching <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-opensearch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Managed OpenSearch</a> offering, a comprehensive solution designed for in depth log analysis, simplifying troubleshooting, and optimizing application performance. </li>

<p>01:37  Matthew- “What I was surprised about, which I did not know, was that console API gateway can now be deployed on Nomad. Was it not able to be deployed before? Just feels weird… you know, consoles should be able to be deployed on nomad compared to that. You know, it&#8217;s all the same company, but sometimes team A doesn&#8217;t always talk to team B.”</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What sort of feels like a “if you care about it, get it moved into HCP before the IBM acquisition is done” <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vagrant Cloud</a> is being migrated to the Hashicorp Cloud Platform (HCP) under the new name of <a href="https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/vagrant/registries?_gl=1*1m0nrj2*_gcl_au*OTI1MzI3NTczLjE3MTc1NjM4NDI." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HCP Vagrant Registry</a>.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">All existing users of Vagrant Cloud are now able to migrate their <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/boxes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vagrant Boxes</a> to HCP. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Vagrant isn’t changing; HCP provides a fully managed platform to make using Vagrant easier. 
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">No Fee for private boxes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Users who migrate can register for free with the same email address as their existing Vagrant cloud account. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Want to review the migration guide? You can find it <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/vagrant-cloud/hcp-vagrant/migration-guide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>01:53  Justin &#8211; “I really think Vagrant would be a key pillar of the IBM future strategy for HashiCorp? Nope, I sure did not. I mean, I figured they&#8217;d probably just keep it open source and people would keep developing on it, but I didn&#8217;t really expect much. So, you know, to at least get this and an improved search experience is kind of nice because the old Vagrant cloud website, it was definitely a little stale. So I can have improved search and a new UI is always nice.”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> has revealed a major attack on its systems that saw customers&#8217; personal information accessed by unknown and unauthorized entities. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The attack, detailed in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467623/000146762324000024/dbx-20240429.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a>, impacted Dropbox Sign, a service that supports e-signatures similar to Docusign. </li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Valkey has continued to rack up support from AWS, Ericsson, Google, Oracle and Verizon initially, to now being joined by Alibaba, Aiven, Heroku and Percona backing Valkey as well.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Numerous blog posts have come out touting Valkey adoption.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">I’m not sure this whole thing is working out as well as Redis CEO Rowan Trollope had hoped. </li>

<h2>AI Is Going Great &#8211; Or How AI Makes All It’s Money </h2>
<p>03:26 <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introducing Meta Llama 3: The most capable openly available LLM to date</a> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Meta has launched Llama 3, the next generation of their state-of-the-art open source large language model. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Llama 3 will be available on AWS, Databricks, GCP, Hugging Face, Kaggle, IBM WatsonX, Microsoft Azure, Nvidia NIM, and Snowflake with support from hardware platforms offered by AMD, AWS, Dell, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Includes new trust and safety tools such as Llama Guard 2, Code Shield and Cybersec eval 2</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They plan to introduce new capabilities, including longer context windows, additional model sizes and enhanced performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The first two models from Meta Lama3 are the 8B and 70B parameter variants that can support a broad range of use cases. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Meta shared some benchmarks against Gemma 7B and Mistral 7B vs the Lama 3 8B models and showed improvements across all major benchmarks.  Including Math with Gemma 7b doing 12.2 vs 30 with Llama 3</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It had highly comparable performance with the 70B model against Gemini Pro 1.5 and Claude 3 Sonnet scoring within a few points of most of the other scores. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Jonathan recommends using LM Studio to get start playing around with LLMS, which you can find at <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://lmstudio.ai/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>04:42  Jonathan &#8211; “Isn&#8217;t it funny how you go from an 8 billion parameter model to a 70 billion parameter model but nothing in between? Like you would have thought there would be some kind of like, some middle ground maybe? But, uh, but&#8230; No. But, um,]]></description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=20783</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>For this special edition of TCP Talks, Justin and Jonathan are joined by Travis Runty, CTO of Public Cloud with Rackspace Technology. In today’s interview, they discuss being accidentally multi cloud, public vs private cloud, and cloud migration, and best practices when assisting clients with their cloud journeys. </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rackspace.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rackspace Technology</a>, commonly known as Rackspace, is a leading multi-cloud solutions provider headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, United States. Founded in 1998, Rackspace has established itself as a trusted partner for businesses seeking expertise in managing and optimizing their cloud environments.</p>
<p>The company offers a wide range of services aimed at helping organizations navigate the complexities of cloud computing, including cloud migration, managed hosting, security, data analytics, and application modernization. Rackspace supports various cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, and GCP, among others. </p>
<p>Rackspace prides itself on its <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/services/fanatical-experience" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Fanatical Experience”</a> approach, which emphasizes delivering exceptional customer support and service. This commitment to customer satisfaction has contributed to Rackspace&#8217;s reputation as a reliable and customer-centric provider in the cloud computing industry. </p>
<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trunty/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Travis Runty</a>, CTO of Public Cloud for Rackspace Technology</p>
<p>Beginning his career with Rackspace as a Linux engineer, Travis has spent the last 15 years working his way through multiple divisions of the company, including 10 years in senior and director level positions. Most recently, Travis served as VP of Technical Support of Global Cloud Operations from 2020-2022. </p>
<p>Travis is extremely passionate about building and leading high performance engineering teams and delivering innovative solutions. Most recently, as a member of their technology council, Travis wrote an article for Forbes &#8211; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/12/14/building-a-cloud-savvy-workforce-empowering-your-team-for-success/?sh=590044651a06" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Building a Cloud-Savvy Workforce: Empowering Your Team for Success</a> &#8211; where he discussed best practices for prioritizing workforce enablement, especially when it comes to training and transformation initiatives. </p>
<p>Interview Notes:</p>
<p>In the main show, TCP has been talking a lot about Cloud / hybrid cloud / multi-cloud and repatriating data back to on prem, and today’s guest knows all about those topics. </p>
<p>Rackspace has had quite a few phases in their journey to public cloud – including building a data center in an unused mall, introducing managed services, creating partnerships with VMware, an attempt to go head to head with the hyperscalers, and then ultimately focusing on public cloud and instead partnering with the hyperscalers. </p>
<p>Rackspace has both a focus on private and public cloud; when it comes to private cloud they focus mainly on VMware and OpenStack, whereas in the public cloud side, Rackspace partners with the hyperscalers to assist clients with their cloud journey. </p>
<p>Quotes from today’s show </p>
<p>Travis: “We want to make sure that when a customer goes on their public cloud journey, that they actually have a robust strategy that is going to be effective. From there, we’re able to leverage our professional services teams to make sure that they can realize that transformation, and hopefully there *is* a transformation, and it’s not just a lift and shift.”</p>
<p>Travis: “A conflict that we continuously have to strike the balance of is when do we apply a cloud native solution, and where do we apply the Rackspace elements on top. The hyperscalers techno]]></description>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">After our news cutoff before Google Next, Hashicorp issued a <a href="https://opentofu.github.io/legal-documents/2024-04-03%20HashiCorp%20C%26D/OpenTofu%20C&amp;D%20-%20Redacted.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">strongly worded Cease and Desist letter</a> to the OpenTofu project, accusing that the project has “repeatedly taken code Hashi provided under the BSL and used it in a manner that violates those license terms and Hashi’s intellectual properties.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It notes that in some instances, OpenTofu has incorrectly re-labeled Hashicorp’s code to make it appear as if it was made available by Hashi, originally under a different license. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hashi gave them until April 10th to remove any allegedly copied code from the OpenTofu repo, threatening litigation if the project failed to do so. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">OpenTofu struck back &#8211; and they came with receipts! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They deny that any BSL licensed code was incorporated into the OpenTofu repo, and that any code they copied came from the MPL-Licensed version of terraform.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">“The OpenTofu team vehemently disagrees with any suggestions that it misappropriated, mis-sourced or misused Hashi’s BSL code. All such statements have zero basis in facts” &#8212; Open Tofu Team</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">OpenTofu showed how the code they accused was lifted from the BSL code, was actually in the MPL version, and then copied into the BSL version from an older version by a Hashi Engineer. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Anticipating third party contributions might submit BSL terraform code unwittingly or otherwise, OpenTofu instituted a “taint team” to compare Terraform and Open Tofu Pull requests.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If the PR is found to be in breach of intellectual property rights, the pull request is closed and the contributor is closed from working on that area of the code in the future. </li>

	<title>TCP Talks: Sandy Bird, Sonrai Security</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>A bonus episode of The Cloud Pod may be just what the doctor ordered, and this week Justin and Jonathan are here to bring you an interview with Sandy Bird of Sonrai Security. There’s so much going on in the IAM space, and we’re really happy to have an expert in the studio with us this week to talk about some of the security least privilege specifics. </p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Sonrai (pronounced Son-ree, which means data in Gaelic) was founded in 2017. Sonrai provides Cloud Data Control, and seeks to deliver a complete risk model of all identity and data relationships, which includes activity and movement across cloud accounts, providers, and third party data stores.</p>

<h2>Meet Sandy Bird, Co founder of <a href="https://www.sonrai.co/cloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sonrai Security</a></h2>
<p>Sandy is the co-founder and CTO of Sonrai, and has a long career in the tech industry. He was the CTO and co-founder of Q1 Labs, which was acquired by IBM in 2011, and helped to drive IBM security growth as CTO for global business security there. </p>
<h2>Interview Notes:</h2>
<p>One of the big questions we start the interview with is just how has IAM evolved &#8211; and what kind of effect have those changes had on the identity models?  Enterprise wants things to be least privilege, but it’s hard to find the logs. In cloud, however *most* things are logged &#8211; and so least privilege became an option. </p>
<p>Sonrai offers the first cloud permissions firewall, which enables one click least privilege management, which is important in the current environment where the platforms operate so differently from each other. With this solution, you have better control of your cloud access, limit your permissions, attack surface, and automate least privilege &#8211; all without slowing down DevOps2. </p>
<p>Is the perfect policy achievable? Sandy breaks it between human identities and workload identities; they’re definitely separate. He claims, in workload identities the perfect policy is probably possible. Human identity is hugely sporadic, however, it’s important to at least try to get to that perfect policy, especially when dealing with sensitive information. One of the more interesting data pieces they found was that less than 10% of identities with sensitive permissions actually used them &#8211; and you can use the information to balance out actually handing out permissions versus a one time use case. </p>
<p>Sonrai spent a lot of time looking at new solutions to problems with permissions; part of this includes purpose-built integration, offering a flexible open GraphQL API with prebuilt integrations. </p>
<p>Sonrai also offers continuous monitoring; providing ongoing intelligence on all the permission usage &#8211; including excess permissions &#8211; and enables the removal of unused permissions without any sort of disruptions. Policy automation automatically writes IAM policies tailored to access needs, and simplifies processes for teams. </p>
<p>On demand access is another tool that gives on demand requests for permissions that are restricted with a quick and efficient process. </p>
<h2>Quotes from today’s show </h2>
<p>Sandy: “The unbelievably powerful model in AWS can do amazing things, especially when you get into some of the advanced conditions &#8211; but man, for a human to understand what all this stuff is, is super hard. Then you go to the Azure model, which is very different. It’s an allow first model. If you have an allow anywhere in the tree, you can do whatever is asked, but there’s this hierarchy to the whole thing, and so when you think you want to remove something you may not even be removing it., because something above may have that permission anyway. It’s a whole different model to learn there.” </p>
<p>Sandy: “Only like 8% of those identities]]></description>

It&#8217;s not necessarily improvements to the core source code. It&#8217;s more management of that source code. Now there are definitely areas where they do make enhancements, but I&#8217;m not sure the vast majority makes sense to be included in an open source made for everyone product either.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 252 of The Cloud Pod podcast, where the forecast is always cloudy! This week Justin, Jonathan, Ryan, and Matthew are talking about InfluxDB, collabs between AWS and NVIDIA, some personnel changes over at Microsoft, Amazon Timestream, and so much more! Sit back and enjoy &#8211; and make sure to hang around for the aftershow, where Linux and DBOS are on the docket. You won’t want to miss it. </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Light a fire under your Big Queries with Spark procedures</li>
<li>All your NVIDIA GPU belong to AWS</li>
<li>Thanks, EU for Free Data Transfer for all*</li>

I mean, I&#8217;m not talking about technical things. It&#8217;s like I ask all kinds of random philosophical questions or whatever, just to kind of explore what it can do, what it knows…If I was going to spend money on OpenAI or Anthropic, it would be on Anthropic right now.”</p>

This week we’re looking at the potential end of low impact code thanks to generative AI, how and why Kubernetes is still hanging on, and Cloudflare’s new defensive AI project.

<h2>Follow-Up</h2>
<p>00:50  <a href="https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-predictions-were-wrong/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kubernetes Predictions Were Wrong</a> &#8212; Redux</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Last week Ryan and Justin talked about why Kubernetes hasn’t disappeared into the background during our after show, and now with Matt and Jonathan here I wanted to see if they had any additional thoughts.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If you missed this two weeks ago, it&#8217;s probably because you don’t know that there are regular after shows after the final bumper of the show… typically about non-cloud things or things that generally interest our hosts. There is one today about the death of the Apple Car. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">To summarize the conversation, ChatGPT has provided us with a sort of CliffsNotes version. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Ryan and Justin speculated on the reasons why Kubernetes (K8) persisted despite predictions of its decline:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Global Pandemic Impact: They acknowledged the global pandemic that unfolded since 2020 and considered its potential influence on Kubernetes. The pandemic might have shifted priorities and accelerated digital transformation efforts, leading to increased reliance on Kubernetes for managing cloud-native applications and infrastructure. Organizations might have intensified their focus on scalable and resilient technologies like Kubernetes to adapt to remote work environments and changing market dynamics.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Unforeseen Complexity: Despite expectations for a simpler alternative to emerge, Kubernetes has grown more complex over time. The ecosystem around Kubernetes has expanded significantly, with various platforms, services, and tools built on top of it. This complexity may have made it challenging for organizations to migrate away from Kubernetes, as they have heavily invested in its ecosystem and expertise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Critical Role in Scalability: Kubernetes remains a fundamental technology for platform engineering teams seeking to achieve scalability and standardization in their operations. Creating a standardized, opinionated path for Kubernetes within organizations enables them to streamline deployment processes, manage resources efficiently, and support the growing demands of modern applications. This critical role in scaling infrastructure and applications might have contributed to Kubernetes&#8217; enduring relevance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Absence of Clear Alternatives: Despite predictions, no single service or platform has emerged as a clear, universally adopted alternative to Kubernetes. While other solutions exist, such as Tanzu, OpenShift, and others mentioned, none have achieved the same level of adoption or provided a compelling reason for orga]]></description>

<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In this week&#8217;s chapter of AI nightmares, ChatGPT tells us how they are blocking the usage of AI by state-affiliated threat actors. Awesome; things went from bad to worse in one week. Cool. Cool cool cool. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In partnership with Microsoft Threat Intelligence, they have disrupted five state-affiliated actors that sought to use their AI service in support of malicious cyber activities</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Charcoal Typhoon (China affiliated) researched various companies and cybersecurity tools, debugged code and generated scripts, and created content likely for use in phishing campaigns.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Salmon Typhoon (China affiliated) translated technical papers, retrieved publicly available information on multiple intelligence agencies and regional threat actors, assisted with coding, and researched common ways processes could be hidden on a system.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Crimson Sandstorm (Iran affiliated) used OpenAI services for scripting support related to app and web development, generating content likely for spear-phishing campaigns, and researching common ways malware could evade detection.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Emerald Sleet (North Korea affiliated) identified experts and organizations focused on defense issues in the Asia-Pacific region, to understand publicly available vulnerabilities, and used OpenAI services for help with basic scripting tasks, and drafting content that could be used in phishing campaigns.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Forest Blizzard (Russia-affiliated) primarily for performing research on open-source data into satellite communication protocols and radar imaging technology, as well as for support with scripting tasks. </li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">OpenAI says the capabilities of the current models are limited, they believe it&#8217;s important to stay ahead of significant and evolving threats. </li>

Today on the pod we’re talking about the new “memory” function in ChatGPT, secrets over at OCI, and Firehose dropping Kinesis like its HOT. Plus plenty of other Cloud and AI news to get you through the week. Let’s get started! </p>

<h2>Follow Up</h2>
<p>00:57 C2C Event </p>
<p>Recently Justin was down at a 2gather event Google’s Cloud headquarters near Moffett Field in Sunnyvale. So to those new listeners who heard Justin there and just couldn’t get enough, welcome! We’re happy to have you. </p>
<p>Want to see what events are coming up, and hopefully near you? Check out the lineup <a href="https://www.c2cglobal.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<h2>General News</h2>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A recent study by <a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/49/2jido7tz9lb2pkmnewg96jd4q/2/4e6862f7f175d31245348c0e6208331fcce77f805eff2fa45a46008f4df51abd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Citrix</a>, is saying that 25% of organizations in the UK have already moved half or more of their cloud-based workloads back to on-premises infrastructures.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The survey questioned 350 IT leaders on their current approaches to cloud computing. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">93% of them had been involved in a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3684369/2023-could-be-the-year-of-public-cloud-repatriation.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cloud repatriation project</a> in the last three years. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Surveyed said their reasons for moving from the Security Issues, High Project Expectations and unmet expectations, with most saying the cost was the biggest motivator, which definitely makes sense to us. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In general this isn’t my experience when talking to listeners, or folks at the recent C2C event; there’s always a few companies that probably shouldn’t have moved to the cloud in the first place, but those numbers don’t pan out to us in who we’re talking to. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We’re interested in listener feedback here &#8211; have any of you been involved in a repatriation project? </li>
</ul>
<p>09:55  Ryan &#8211; “I think it&#8217;s kind of the same thing that happened in reverse a few years ago, where it&#8217;s like all the companies are moving to the cloud. The same reports were, you know, 50 % of companies are moving other entire workloads into the cloud. And now it&#8217;s sort of the pendulum swinging the other way.”</p>
<h2>AI is Going Great (or how ML Makes all Its Money) &#8211;  ChatGPT gets Reveries</h2>
<p>12:37 <a href="https://openai.com/blog/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Memory and new controls for ChatGPT</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">ChatGPT is adding a new “memory” feature; “remembering” allows you to ask the bot to remember things you have chatted about with ChatGPT in the past. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"> So things like you love to travel, you have a daughter, etc.  </li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This represents a 17.6% year over year in the quarter. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The intelligent cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Streets Accounts. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%, when analysts only expected 27.7%.  
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Six points are tied to AI as Microsoft now has 53,000 Azure AI customers and 1/3rd are new in the past year (per Microsoft.) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>02:46  Justin- “I don’t think the count the Open AI customers, do you? Because there’s way more people that have Open AI usage than 53,000. So I think this is legitimately Azure AI &#8211; which is Open AI under the hood &#8211; but specifically paying for that subscription.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 243 of the Cloud Pod podcast &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! It’s a bit of a slow new week, but we’re not hitting the snooze button! This week Justin, Matthew and Ryan are discussing more changes over at Broadcom after VMware buyout last year, HPE buying out Juniper Networks, why all the venture capital money seems to be going into trying to take down Nvidia, and changes to WHOIS lookup over at AWS certificate manager. Plus we’ll find out exactly what that special something is that makes Justin the perfect executive. </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Years Happened and there is no Good New News </li>
<li>The Cloud Pod Was Always Security Challenged </li>
<li>Azure Shows the Health of Their Business by Springing into Discounts </li>
<li>Network Gear Powers AI &#8211; Who Knew? </li>
</ul>

<h3>We’re sponsorless this week! Interested in sponsoring us and having access to a very niche market of cloud engineers? We’d love to talk to you. Send us an email or hit us up on our Slack Channel. </h3>
<h2>Follow Up</h2>
<p>01:48 More news from Broadcom &#8211; and this time they’re coming after the cloud.  <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/broadcom_ends_vmware_partner_program/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Broadcom ditches VMware Cloud Service Providers</a> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Remember in November when Broadcom bought VMware for $61 billion dollars? Well, the reorganization from that purchase is continuing. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Broadcom is reportedly ditching the majority of their VMware Cloud Service Providers as part of the shakeup of the partner program. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Notable companies in the CSP program include Oracle, Azure, Rackspace, and Google. These larger companies most likely won’t be impacted (yet.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It&#8217;s suspected that they will get moved over to a new partner program, but Broadcom is culling it down to only the largest partners to remain in the program.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">There are lots of smaller cloud players who are in the CSP who will likely be impacted and should keep an eye on this over the next few months. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><a href="https://cloud.vmware.com/providers/search-result" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cloud.vmware.com/providers/search-result</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It’s a bad look for Broadcom, as they told the EU that acquiring VMware would increase competition in the cloud space &#8211; but cutting partners out of the program seems to be a consolidation to me. </li>
</ul>
<p>03:29   Ryan &#8211; “I wonder if this is just going to be like new sales or something. Cause that seems very short notice if you&#8217;re on VMware as on one of these smaller cloud providers, that seems incredibly risky.”</p>
<p>03:45   Matthew &#8211; “I feel like they have to have something lined up. Or let me rephrase that. I would assume slash hope they have something lined up because otherwise they&#8217;re gonna really piss off a lot of people.”</p>
<h2>General News</h2>
<p>04:40 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hewlett-packard-enterprise-buying-juniper-131241287.html?guccounter=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise buying Juniper Networks in deal valued at about $14 billion</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">HPE is buying Juniper Networks in an all cash deal valued at $14B, which will double the HPE networking business.</li>

<h2>General Podcast News</h2>
<p>00:23 Lot’s of changes around these here parts! </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">As we reflect on 2023, we would love to hear your general thoughts on the podcast. 2023 was a big year of changes for us. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Peter left as host, and we replaced him with Matt.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">We dropped the lightning round, and reduced the number of stories we covered; going for more depth and discussion. (I think we could still improve here.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">We added the Cloud Journeys and did a segment on CCOE, Containers, Kubernetes, Cloud Platform, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">We added the aftershow to talk about tech adjacent things that interest us as hosts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2">Absolutely do get on our Slack channel and let us know what you all would like to hear or your general thoughts on the show. </li>

<h2>2023 Predictions</h2>
<p>Also known as “things we’re always wrong about.”</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Jonathan: Microsoft will release in preview of an Azure branded Chat GPT</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Justin: Data Sovereignty will drive single panes of glass against multi-cloud
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Totally missed on this on panes of glass, but OUT OF THE PARK when it comes to data sovereignty. That was a big deal this year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ryan: An influx of all of the AI and No-Code solution convergence. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">We’re closer…but not quite there yet. Maybe another year or two. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Peter: Recession will drive significant developer layoffs, and drive automation solutions for ops and deployment..
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">So, layoffs were a thing. But not because of recession, but because of corporate greed. So that’s fun. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>06:50  Ryan &#8211; “I also think Microsoft will get there’s no matter which way it goes, right? Because they’re either gonna sell it directly, or their investment in Open AI will pay off through shareholder price of stocks.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 240! It’s a doozy this week! Justin, Ryan, Jonathan and Matthew are your hosts in this supersized episode. Today we talk about Google Gemini, the GCP sales force (you won&#8217;t believe the numbers) and Google feudalism. (There’s some lovely filth over here!) Plus we discuss the latest happenings over at HashiCorp, Broadcom, and the Code family of software. So put away your ugly sweaters and settle in for episode 240 of The Cloud Pod podcast &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>

<li>The CloudPod looks forward to semantic versioning now Mitchell has left Hashicorp</li>
<li>Amazon Fiefdoms, Microsoft Sovereignty&#8230; I look forward to Google Feudalism</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Broadcom is wasting no time pissing off the VMware community after the closure of their purchase of Vmware. They moved quick! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">With absolutely no warning, Broadcom is killing VMWares on-premise perpetual licenses, and forcing you to move onto subscriptions. According to Broadcom, this is “<a href="https://news.vmware.com/company/vmware-by-broadcom-business-transformation?ref=thestack.technology" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">simplifying</a>” their lineup and licensing model. Sure. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">They are doing this by ending the sale of support and subscriptions effective immediately. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This impacts the Vsphere family of products, Cloud Foundation, SRM and the Aria suite. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You may continue to use your existing perpetual licenses until your current contract expires.
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">They will most likely provide a one time incentive of some kind for the transition to subscription. Then, you get to pay FOREVER. Insert Mr. Burns laugh here. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You will also be able to “bring your own subscription” for license portability to Vmware validated hybrid cloud endpoints running VMware Cloud foundation. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">They are also sweetening the deal by offering 50% off V<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchvmware/definition/VMware-Cloud-Foundation?ref=thestack.technology" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">mware Cloud Foundation</a>, and including higher support service levels including enhanced support for activating the product and lifecycle management.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Competitors are rapidly raising their hand to fill the gap mainly led by Nutanix, who points out the entire business model for Broadcom is to maximize the acquired asset within 2 to 3 years and as a VMWare customer you will *feel* it. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[The Cloud Pod Sees the Irony of Using AI to Assist with Climate Change 
<p>Welcome to episode 239 of The Cloud Pod podcast, where the forecast is always cloudy! Jonathan, Matthew and Ryan are your hosts this week as we talk about all things AI and Climate Change &#8211; and Google’s assertion that their AI is going to fix it all. Also on today’s agenda: updates to Google Next’s new dates, Azure’s chips, Defender, and all the shenanigans over at OpenAI. Join us! </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<p>Microsoft Ignites my dislike for their conferences </p>
<p>Google keeps using that Sustainability word….</p>
<p>The gift of no cost learning</p>
<p>The CloudPod has an advent calendar for AI</p>

<h2>General News</h2>
<p>00:50 <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/blog/broadcom-announces-successful-acquisition-of-vmware" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Broadcom announces successful acquisition of VMware</a> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.broadcom.com/info/vmware" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Broadcom</a> has completed its acquisition of VMware… and apparently it’s a new and exciting era! (Hopefully more exciting than Tanzu has been.) </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Broadcom is mostly known for networking communication chips, but has been diversifying their portfolio for a while now.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Vmware joins companies such as:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Rally Software</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">CA Products</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Plex (not *that* plex)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Appneta</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Clarity</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Symantec</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Siteminder</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>01:58  Matthew &#8211; “I feel like whenever you get acquired, a lot of the duplicated admin services and like HR, finance, some of those kind of naturally &#8211; like whenever a company gets acquired, I feel like there&#8217;s always layoffs within the first six months, and it&#8217;s really just a lot of those overlapping services now that the parent org has. But I know that they own Symantec. That was news to me.”</p>
<p>04:36  Ryan &#8211; “I think that the big value prop was for a lot of these things was, you know, being able to run that virtualized infrastructure and then the partnerships are, you know, to be able to run that with the same skill sets and the same people running both without having to get into the specifics of, you know, AWS or Azure cloud specifics. And so offering that as sort of a generalized compute… I think as cloud has become more prevalent and popular and there&#8217;s more people that know it, not enough, but still more. I think that value really goes down where you no longer need that sort of UI driven cloud management service that VMware provided for years.”</p>
<h2>AI is Going Great!</h2>
<p>06:11 **See Aftershow**</p>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>06:17 If you haven’t already, go listen to ep 238! </p>
<p>That’s our AWS re:Invent recap show; there really isn&#8217;t any AWS news outside of that for this week. </p>
<h2>GCP</h2>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 238 of the Cloud Pod Podcast &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! This week we’re bringing you a preview of Amazon re:Invent 2023. We’re talking all things AWS, Bedrock, Q, and frugal architecture, and &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; AI. </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<p> Amazon Builds on Bedrock with Q</p>
<p> You Need to Be All Frugal Architects </p>

<h2>“Pre”:Invent </h2>
<p>Is it just us, or is a lot of the stuff released during pre-invent stuff that would have been main stage just a few years ago? </p>
<p>01:48 Major Items</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-cloudfront-keyvaluestore-a-low-latency-datastore-for-cloudfront-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introducing Amazon CloudFront KeyValueStore: A low-latency datastore for CloudFront Functions</a></p>
<p>03:43  Ryan &#8211; “I found this being announced pre-invent to be kind of shocking, because this is one of those announcements where you could re-architect your entire app for better performance using this type of solution, and it&#8217;s not even big enough for the main stage. But there&#8217;s huge potential in doing that edge transformation so that you can directly serve at the edge at much lower latency. So it&#8217;s awesome.”</p>

<p>*No Terraform yet, but hopefully that will come soon! </p>
<p>05:18  Jonathan &#8211; “I think it&#8217;s great for learning too, actually. I mean, I use this in the Google console all the time because I try and put together a command line to do something and it fails miserably. And so I go and do it in the console and it generates the command line coding thing. Ah, I missed that thing, which isn&#8217;t documented anywhere.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 236 of the Cloud Pod Podcast, where the forecast is always cloudy! Are you wandering around every day wondering just who has the biggest one? Chips, we mean. Of course. Get your mind out of the gutter. Did you know Azure was winning that battle for like 8 whole minutes? Join us for episode 236 where we talk about chip size, LLM’s, updates to Bedrock, and Toxicity Detection &#8211; something you will never find applied to the podcast. Not on purpose, anyway. </p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The battle for AI talent is heating up between open AI and Google. With compensation packages but also promises of access to more hardware, better chips and more. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Open AI depends on Microsoft for its cloud resources, whereas Google owns its cloud and is manufacturing their own AI chips. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Salaries are crazy with stock compensation with Open AI saying their stock compensation could be worth as much as 5-10m.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Of course assuming that recruits start before the company goes public or gets completely acquired by MS. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">So, bottom line? Money. Are you shocked? We’re shocked. </li>
</ul>
<p>01:30  Jonathan &#8211; “I guess it&#8217;s quite a concern actually that since Google bought DeepMind they have pretty much two-thirds of the entire global AI talent at their own disposal. So I guess this is a desperate needs, call for desperate measures kind of thing.”</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Nvidia on Monday announced a new graphics processing unit, the H200, which next year could become the most advanced chip on the market for developing AI. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The chip&#8217;s memory capacity has been significantly upgraded compared to the H100, which has been in high demand and boosting NVIDIA stock 240% since Jan 1.  The increased memory allows LLM models powered by H200 chips to generate results nearly twice as fast as those running on H100s</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Cloud companies should have the new chips available in 2nd quarter 2024 and will put these in tight competition with AMD’s MI300X gpu’s slated for release later this year.  </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 234 of The Cloud Pod podcast &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! This week your hosts Justin and Ryan are bringing you all the latest news from the cloud, including latest earnings news (you know you want it), a discussion about whether cloud is “bad” from one of repatriation’s biggest advocates, Oxide’s new cloud computer (it’s SO pretty) and a look at some of latest updates on the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. </p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We’ve talked previously on the show about DHH &#8211; David Heinemeier Hansson &#8211; who is the one big example of cloud repatriation. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Well, maybe not the biggest  but the most vocal for sure when it comes to advocating for a return to on-prem. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Forrest Brazel wrote in his recent newsletter about the back and forth between pro-cloud people and those who support DHH’s move from AWS back to his DC. I think his rebuttal is the best one out there. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">He basically broke down the decision on cloud or datacenter to a 2&#215;2 box… Low IT Competence with Low Growth or High Growth, and High IT Competency with Low Growth or High Growth.  
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">He basically says Basecamp falls into High IT Competency with low growth, which makes datacenter more attractive. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>03:43  Justin- “Kelsey Hightower pointed out rightfully the 15 years of cloud helped DHH even be able to do this, because being able to do a cloud exit of the size and the complexity of what he does have without cloud technologies that enabled some of those things, it would have been difficult for him to do this going back. Declarative infrastructure, containerization &#8211; all that stuff is big cloud advances that were brought to the world that he&#8217;s not benefiting from in his data center&#8230;”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If you want to have some “fun” you need to update the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RDS</a> SSL certificate for your db instances before they expire in 2024. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This impacts really any DB created before <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/urgent-important-rotate-your-amazon-rds-aurora-and-documentdb-certificates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2020</a>.  
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">You can choose CA certificates that expire in 40 years or 100 years. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This was more complicated than we realized when we did this on a database instance recently, and this step-by-step guide would have been great when we did it a month or so ago. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Step 1: Identify your impacted DB’s</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Step 2: Update your database client and apps… this was the trickiest part for us. </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Step 4: Rinse and Repeat on Production. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>01:45  Justin- “I definitely went for the 100 years to fake because I never want to do this again… This is not for the faint of heart, if you&#8217;re not familiar with how your database apps work, and do proceed with caution.”</p>
<p>05:48 Justin- “Well, so the 40 year one is a 2048 bit RSA certificate. The 100 year one is an RSA 4096 or an ECC 384 compiled. So it&#8217;s pretty high level encryption on both of those CAs. And the fun thing about that is if you do choose the 100 year certificate and you have like a T3 class system, all of a sudden now you&#8217;re processing a lot of stuff to calculate the cipher. So you may have some use cases where you don&#8217;t want to use the 100 year certificate because it does require some more CPU to process.”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It’s not all bad news though &#8211; AMD does have some advantages that may make it worth it, including a chip that combines the GPU, which performs multiple computations simultaneously, and a CPU which executes more general instructions and manages the systems broader operations.

When it used to just be &#8211; sort of &#8211; you had optimized at the computer level and maybe at the OS level, but now the workloads are so specific because they&#8217;re so demanding, and then power is also very challenging. So that&#8217;s kind of neat. I&#8217;m kind of glad I don&#8217;t have to deal with it much.”</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Terraform test allows authors to consistently validate the functionality of their configuration in a safe environment. Tests are written using familiar HCL syntax, so there is no need to learn a new language to get started. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Config-Driven import introduced in Terraform 1.5 gets improvements to support variable driven ID attributes. Making it easier than ever to import existing items. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Cli Improvements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Several changes are coming to the S3 Backend remote state in this release to better align with the SDK and the official terraform AWS provider. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">It should still work but you may receive warnings about deprecated attributes. May the odds be ever in your favor. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You can check out the Testing Terraform overview page <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>, or the Write Terraform tests tutorial <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>03:22  Justin &#8211; “ One of the interesting things that, you know, that wasn&#8217;t part of this particular announcement is that they&#8217;re also adding an ability to use AI to help you with your test cases. And so basically the model, they built an LLM model to specifically trained on HCL and the Terraform test framework to help model authors begin testing their code.”</p>

This week we’re sailing our pod across the data lake and talking about updates to managed delivery from Kafka. We also take a gander at Bedrock, some new security tools from our friends over at Google. We’re also back with our Cloud Journey Series talking security theater.Stay Tuned!  </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>

<h2>General News this Week:</h2>
<p>01:15 Microsoft fans… This isn’t going to be pretty. You were warned. </p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft comes under blistering criticism for “grossly irresponsible” security</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In what has turned out to be a not so great week for Microsoft (and their customers) the software giant has<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/10/03/defending-new-vectors-threat-actors-attempt-sql-server-to-cloud-lateral-movement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> released an urgent warning</a> for SQL server instances running on Azure. **Insert meme of dog saying it’s fine surrounded by fire here**</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Microsoft has detailed a new campaign in which attackers unsuccessfully attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment through a SQL server instance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The attacker initially exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in an app, and then was able to gain access and elevated permission on MS SQL instance deployed in Azure VM. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The threat actor than attempted to move horizontally by abusing the server’s cloud identity, which could possess elevated permissions (least privilege folks)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">MS says it found no evidence that the attacker successfully moved.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Considering the recent criticism by Tenable CEO who threw them under the bus for not fixing a major vulnerability for over 90 days, this warning and confirmation seems like a step in the right direction. </li>
</ul>
<p>04:37  Matthew- “I mean, also just the scale of these hypervisors, sometimes it just takes time. Like &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to quickly roll out a hotfix to something, realize you caused another problem, and now you&#8217;re playing whack-a-mole because you&#8217;re moving too fast and not taking a step back and fixing the root cause of it.”</p>

This week your hosts are Justin, Jonathan, Matthew and Ryan &#8211; and they&#8217;re REALLY excited to tell you all about the 161 one things announced at Google Next. Literally, all the things. We’re also saying farewell to EC2 Classic, Amazon SES, and Azure’s Explicit Proxy &#8211; which probably isn’t what you think it is. </h3>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>

<li>The Cloud Pod would like you to engage with our email.</li>
<li>Oracle Rover to Base… Come In Rover</li>

<li>How high can you count, Google can count to 161</li>
<li>The cloud pod would like to get consensus on the definition of light weight</li>

<h2>General News this Week:</h2>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>00:36 <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/09/farewell-ec2-classic.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Farewell EC2-Classic, it’s been swell</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Werner has a blog post talking about the end of Ec2-classic, with the final EC2-Classic instance being turned off on August 15th, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-classic-is-retiring-heres-how-to-prepare/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2 years after the announcement</a>. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">He points out that the reason it was “classic” is because of the network architecture. All instances launched on a giant 10.0.0.0/8 flat network shared between all customers. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The process for end users was simple, but it was highly complex for AWS at the time. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The m1.small that launched was equivalent of 1 virtual CPU powered by a 1.7ghz Xeon processor with 1.75gb of ram, and 160gb of local disk, and 250mb/s of network bandwidth. For the low price of $0.10 per clocked hour. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Werners blog even ran on the m1 small for 5+ years before he moved it to the Amazon S3 website feature.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">VPC’s introduced in 2013, allows AWS customers to have their own slice of the cloud.. But classic still lived for another decade. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The EC2 team kept classic running until every instance was retired or migrated, providing the necessary documentation, tools and support from engineering and account management through the process. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Werner shows that this is one of the best examples of delivering cloud for today&#8217;s workloads as well as tomorrow, and how AWS won’t pull the rug out from under you. </li>
</ul>
<p>02:08  Ryan &#8211; “I think most people know who he was referring to there. But it is cool. I mean, the fact that they were able to actually retire a thing and not just turn it off on people is pretty amazing.”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">So you know Github Copilot, Duet AI, and Codewhisperer…. But do you know Code LLama? (Meta you better get good stickers on this)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Meta has released the source code for the<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Llama 2 </a>based Code Specialized LLM in three sizes 7B, 13B, and 35B parameters.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Each model is trained with 500b tokens of code and code-related data. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The 7B and 13b base and instructor models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle capability allowing them to insert code into existing code. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The 7B model can run on a single GPU, the 34B model however returns the best results and for the best for coding assistance… while the 7b and 13b are great for real-time code completions. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Training recipes for Code Llama are available on the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>. </li>

<p>04:08 Matthew &#8211; “It&#8217;s interesting; if you go deep into the article there, they start to digress into like ‘Hey, this 7 and the 13 billion are better for near real time response back’ and the 34 billion…  is better for fine tuning for yourself. So they really go into a little bit more detail of how to do it. And, you know, I think they also put out some code snippets if you kind of dive into it a little bit more, which I thought was very nice.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<h2>Google Next Eve!</h2>
<p>Welcome episode 225 of The CloudPod Podcast &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! Justin, Jonathan, and Ryan are your hosts this week as we discuss all things Google Next! We talk schedule offerings, make our predictions about announcements, and prepare to be generally wrong about everything. Also &#8211; do you like stickers? Everyone likes stickers! Be on the lookout for us, and maybe you can have one. </p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<p>None! Google Next is the next big thing, so of course it’s the title. </p>
<h3>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor:</h3>
<h3><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a> provides top-notch cloud and DevOps engineers to the world’s most innovative companies. Initiatives stalled because you have trouble hiring?  Foghorn can be burning down your DevOps and Cloud backlogs as soon as next week.</h3>
<h2>Pre-Show</h2>
<p>01:23 Following up on some HashiCorp News: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-updates-licensing-faq-based-on-community-questions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HashiCorp updates licensing FAQ based on community questions</a> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hashicorp has responded in their FAQ to some of the concerns we brought up when we talked about them moving to the BSL license in our last show. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Question: Can I host the HashiCorp products as a service internal to my organization?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Answer: Yes. The terms of the BSL allow for all non-production and production usage, except for providing competitive offerings to third parties that embed or host our software. Hosting the products for your internal use of your organization is permitted. HashiCorp considers an organization as including all of its affiliates. This means one division can host a HashiCorp product for use by another internal division.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Q: What is a “competitive offering” under the HashiCorp BSL license?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">A: A “competitive offering” is a product that is sold to third parties, including through paid support arrangements, that significantly overlaps the capabilities of a HashiCorp commercial product. For example, this definition would include hosting or embedding Terraform as part of a solution that is sold competitively against our commercial versions of Terraform. By contrast, products that are not sold or supported on a paid basis are always allowed under the HashiCorp BSL license because they are not considered competitive.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Q: What does the term “embedded” mean under the HashiCorp BSL license?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">A: Under the HashiCorp BSL license, the term “embedded” means including the source code or object code, including executable binaries, from a HashiCorp product in a competitive product. “Embedded” also means packaging the competitive product in such a way that the HashiCorp product must be accessed or downloaded for the competitive product to operate.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Q: What if HashiCorp releases a new product or feature in the future that makes my project competitive?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">A: If HashiCorp creates an offering in the future that is competitive with a product you are already offering in production, your continued use of the hosted or embedded HashiCorp product will not be considered a violation of the HashiCorp BSL license.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>03:43 Ryan &#8211; “I think this is the right response, right? And I know that I&#8217;m probably in the minority of being sort of appeased by this in the community; because I think that the torches and pitchforks will not go away. But what this does is allow &#8211; if there&#8217;s ]]></description>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Do you use tools like N0 or ScaleSet? Or perhaps some of the other Terraform-adjacent things? You **may** be in some trouble. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Despite being ok with Amazon and GCP integrating their open source &#8211; and now Terraform cloud offering &#8211; Hashicorp is mad at companies adopting their technology and productizing it, forcing them to move to the new BSL (Business Source License) model. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This covers all Hashicorp products, not just Terraform. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">HashiCorp points out that their approach has enabled them to partner closely with cloud providers to enable tight integrations for their joint users and customers, as well as hundreds of other technology partners.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">There are vendors who take advantage of pure OSS models, and the community work on OSS projects, for their own commercial goals, without providing material contributions back. (GASP!)

<li>I swear to you Mr. Compliance Man, Mutator is not as bad as it sounds</li>
<li>Oracle Cloud customer  &#8211; or how we let Oracle Audit us internally at will </li>
<li>We are all confused by the lack of AWS news</li>
<li>The CloudPod copies other Podcast’s Features</li>

<h2>General News this Week:</h2>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>No AWS news &#8211; so that should tell you we’re DEFINITELY getting close to announcement season. </p>
<h2>GCP</h2>
<p>01:35 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/announcing-new-sql-functions-for-json-in-bigquery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Introducing new SQL functions to manipulate your JSON data in BigQuery</a> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Enterprises are generating data at an exponential rate, spanning traditional structured transactional data, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/json-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semi-structured like JSON</a> and unstructured data like images and audio. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Beyond the scale, the divergent types present processing challenges for developers, sometimes requiring a separate processing flow for each. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">BigQuery supported semi structured JSON at launch eliminating the need for processing and providing schema flexibility, intuitive querying and the scalability benefits afforded to structured data. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Google is now releasing new sql functions for Bigquery JSON, extending the power and flexibility of their core JSON support. These new functions make it easier to extract and construct JSON data and perform complex data analysis. 
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Convert JSON values into primitive types (INT64, FLOAT64, BOOL and STRING)
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3">Is anyone else insulted that STRING is considered primitive?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">easier and more flexible way with new <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#lax_converters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON LAX </a>functions</li>

This week we take an in depth look at the latest earnings reports from all the major players, changes to IPv4 costs (inflation), Healthscribe, and all the news (in cybersecurity) that’s fit to print. </h3>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The CloudPod can finally read the doctors notes with HealthScribe</li>
<li>Amazon Healthscribe it&#8217;s like transcription, but for doctors who use big words</li>
<li>You get an LLM, you get an LLM; apparently EVERYTHING at Amazon gets an LLM</li>
<li>Should The Cloud Pod rename itself C? </li>
<li>Musk Flips Twitter the Bird (just for Jonathan)</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The guys didn’t talk about this when it came up, as it didn’t get a full blog post and we killed lightning round &#8211; but Matt has **thoughts!** </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Azure storage strives to give you an effective disaster recovery offering and are now supporting customer-managed failover for ADLS Gen 2 accounts. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Whether you are performing testing or facing a true disaster your primary endpoint can now initiate a failover from our primary endpoint to your secondary endpoint. </li>
</ul>
<p>01:40 Matt &#8211; “It&#8217;s just one of those features that I&#8217;m just dumbfounded that didn&#8217;t exist day one. You know, encryption, DR &#8211; these things should just be there. And the fact that it&#8217;s ADLS has been around for a decent amount of time.”</p>
<h2>General News this Week:</h2>
<p>03:06 The big news this week is EARNINGS:</p>
<ul>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Microsoft beat expectations, both for the last quarter and for when they were going to announce. It was early! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Net income of 20.1 billion for Fiscal 4th quarter 2023; which is up 20% from a year earlier. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Revenue rose to 56.19 Billion, ahead of Wall Street’s expectation of 55.47 billion</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Stock still dropped 3% in after hours trading and is basically down 5% since the announcement on July 25th.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Despite all of this, the future doesn’t look super great per MS COF Amy Hood, who said that first quarter revenue is only going to be between 53.8 and 54.8 billion, implying growth of only about 8%.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">This is tied to revenue growth of less than 10% by three consecutive quarters.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Microsoft Intelligent cloud was up 15% (Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server, Github, Nuance, Visual Studio and Enterprise services) overall was up 15%.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<h3>Welcome episode 221 of The Cloud Pod podcast &#8211; where the forecast is always cloudy! This week your hosts, Justin, Jonathan, Ryan, and Matthew look at some of the announcements from AWS Summit, as well as try to predict the future &#8211; probably incorrectly &#8211; about what’s in store at Next 2023. Plus, we talk more about the storm attack, SFTP connectors (and no, that isn’t how you get to the Moscone Center for Next) Llama 2, Google Cloud Deploy and more! </h3>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now You Too Can Get Ignored by Google Support via Mobile App</li>
<li>The Tech Sector Apparently Believes Multi-Cloud is Great… We Hate You All. </li>
<li>The cloud pod now wants all your HIPAA Data</li>

<li>The Cloud Pod Recursively Deploys Deploy</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">We didn’t find anything in the survey particularly interesting, until they broke it down by respondents who are actively in the tech industry. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Despite strong Macro pressure and recent earnings reports about slowness in growth, 48% of respondents increased their cloud spend in the last 12 months</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">94% of tech industry respondents indicated that multi-cloud works, citing that it has advanced or achieved their company’s business goals.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Sure, Jan. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">91% of tech companies rely on platform teams. </li>
</ul>
<p>01:37 Justin &#8211; “The thing about that is, I could see the value for Saas vendors, right? Especially if you&#8217;re dealing with large data ingestion. I think we were talking to
New Relic, for example, when they launched a New Relic on Azure.It saves their customers a bunch of money because they&#8217;re not doing egress charges out to the internet to AWS to basically get the New Relic data in. And they see that as a strategy that helps customers reduce money and also helps increase adoption as well as partnership opportunities.”</p>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>05:11 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/new-york/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Summit New York </a> just happened, and there were a lot of announcements (and protests.)

This and much more in our newest episode. </h3>

<li>Too Many Bees died for Honeycode</li>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>02:02 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/detecting-and-stopping-recursive-loops-in-aws-lambda-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Detecting and stopping recursive loops in AWS Lambda functions</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Do you utilize AWS Lambda? Here’s an update for you. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">AWS Lambda is introducing a recursion control to detect and stop lambda functions running in a recursive or infinite loop.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This supports Lambda Integrations with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SQS</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SNS </a>or directly via the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Invoke API</a>.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Lambda defects functions that appear to be running in a recursive loop and drops the request after exceeding 16 invocations</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This can help reduce costs from an unexpected lambda invocation because of recursion. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You’ll receive notification that this action was taken through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health-dashboard/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Health Dashbboard</a>, email or by configuring <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Cloudwatch Alarms</a>. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You can turn this off by reaching out to AWS support, if you have a valid use-case where recursion is intentional, or if you need to loop something through more than 16 times.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This is also the trap &#8211; if you say turn it off and then cry about a ridiculous bill due to your runaway recursion &#8211; they will now force you to pay it. So, listeners beware.</li>
</ul>
<p>03:50 Matt- “I can definitely say I’ve caused an ‘in the hundreds of dollars’ very rapidly by this in the past in a dev account. So it&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s easy to do if you are doing recursion and you make an ‘if’ statement the wrong way.”</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">IBM is acquiring software company <a href="https://www.apptio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Apptio</a> Inc for 4.6B in cash. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">THe move comes five years after Vista Equity bought the firm for 1.94B</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Apptio was created in 2007, and was notable as the first company Andreeson Horowitz invested in. Apptio owns Cloudability, among other features. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Apptio offers cloud-based technology and hybrid business management software for managing business in the IT field.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna said in a statement “Technology is changing business at a rate and pace we’ve never seen before. To capitalize on these changes, it is essential to optimize investments which drive better business value, and Apptio does just that. Apptio’s offerings combined with IBM’s IT automation software and watsonx AI platform, gives clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize and manage all of their technology investments.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2:30Ryan &#8211; “The last time I played with Apptio was very early in my cloud experience and Apptio was struggling to understand how to sort of port their methodologies into cloud. It worked really well in the data center and for IT shops, for tracking assets and managing visibility into cost and financials there, but it really struggled with stuff like dynamically changing instance groups and that sort of thing. It made sense when they bought Cloudability, and I haven’t played with it since.”</p>

<p>06:10Justin &#8211;  “I did have an opportunity to talk to some startups. they&#8217;re on the floor and they&#8217;re thinking about kind of the next generation and what that looks like and you&#8217;re really talking about bringing AI and LLM technology into FinOps and how do you get beyond the basics of it. I think we&#8217;re at this kind of cusp of the end of the Gen 1 era… I suspect that we&#8217;re in for a bunch of FinOps and capabilities coming out of these vendors as they try to figure out what their v2 is, and potentially new startups that are going to come in and be disruptive to the Gen 1 players, because I think it&#8217;s a commodity, which was my big takeaway from the conference in general. It was good. It was a nice time. I definitely recommend going if you&#8217;re in the FinOps space.”</p>

Today your hosts are Jonathan and Matt as we discuss all things cloud and AI, including Temporary Elevated Access Management (or TEAM, since we REALLY like acronyms today)  FTP servers, SQL servers and all the other servers, as well as pipelines, whether or not the government should regulate AI (spoiler alert: the AI companies don’t think so) and some updates to security at Amazon and Google. </h3>

<li>The CloudPod can now Team into your account, but only temporarily </li>
<li>The CloudPod dusts off their old floppy drive </li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You can now connect via SSH and RDP to EC2 instances without using public IP addresses.  With EIC endpoints, customers have remote connectivity to their instances in private subnets, eliminating the need to use public IPv4 addresses for connectivity. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Previously you would have needed to create bastion hosts to tunnel SSH/RDP connections to instances with private IP addresses, but that created its own set of problems because bastion hosts would have to be patched, managed and audited as well as incur additional costs. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">EIC endpoint combines <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS IAM</a>-based access controls to restrict access to trusted principles with network-based controls such as security group rules. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It provides an audit of all connections via AWS cloud trail, helping customers improve their security posture. </li>

<p>04:11 Jonathan &#8211; “It’s kind of cool &#8211; it’s a neat hack as well as a way of AWS providing a really useful feature without having to do any work on the cloud platform itself. Just implement the tool that does the deploying rather than having a service which could do it for you.”</p>

<p>06:36 Matt- “I was thinking about it at the end of the migration &#8211; we finally got it all replicated; now we’re gonna wait a month before we actually cut over.

<h3>Titles we almost went with (and there’s a lot this week)</h3>
<p>The Cloud Pod becomes the cloud docs
The Cloud Pod loves inspector gadget
The Cloud Pod documents the documentation
The Cloud Pod bangs its shin, since geospatial abilities are lacking
The Cloud Pod bangs its shin, since we lack geospatial abilities
The Cloud Pod bangs its shin, if only we had geospatial abilities
Unlike the Cloud Pod, Alibaba Cloud exits the stage
Retiring AWS Documents on Github… or how we laid off too many people in our
document team and can’t support this albatross anymore
Microsoft Builds AI tools at its Build Conference and Wants you to Build More</p>

<p>01:29 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-19/alibaba-to-exit-lucrative-cloud-business-as-beijing-mars-promise?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alibaba to Exit Cloud Business After Beijing Undercuts Potential</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Alibaba is apparently planning to spin out its $12 Billion dollar cloud business. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">It’s unclear if Alibaba is bowing to market pressures or political pressures; in 2020 Beijing became increasingly suspicious of cloud services operated by private firms, and started cracking down on internet services. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Alibaba Cloud drew regulatory ire in 2021 for discovering and sharing a flaw before informing authorities (there goes their citizenship score), and was investigated for its role in China’s largest cybersecurity leak. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Analysts value it at 30B, and was a once thriving operation that harbored the potential to AWS level of market control in China. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“This full spinoff plan involving AliCloud is both bold and puzzling, “Nomura Holdings Inc analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen wrote in a note. &#8220;<em>Their current valuation for the unit stands at about $31 billion. AliCloud is BABA’s organic business and is still deemed as one of the long-term drivers for the group even though its growth temporarily slowed down in recent quarters due to macro headwinds. That is why we find it puzzling that BABA has decided to fully spin off this business instead of retaining a minority stake at least</em><em>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>04:30 Justin &#8211; “We&#8217;re basically entering a very Cold War period between the US and Chinese. And so that&#8217;s gonna be interesting to see how that continues to shake out. I saw some articles this week as well, like in the information about VC firms trying to exit their investments in China and just realizing that it&#8217;s not gonna be the growth engine they expect it to be. I mean, we talked about here on the show even some of the supply chain issues with China, with the cloud providers and how it&#8217;s impacted them. And now, I just saw this week, Apple just announced that they were making chips with Broadcom on US soil for some things. So, there&#8217;s definitely an undercurrent in our politics about China in general.”</em></p>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<p>01:10 &#8211; <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Terraform </a>is in the news! </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-cloud-updates-plans-with-an-enhanced-free-tier-and-more-flexibility" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Terraform Cloud updates plans with an enhanced Free tier and more flexibility</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A bunch of new updates are coming to Terraform Cloud</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">These update will provide access to **premium** features, up to 500 resources in the free tier</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">There are also new paid offerings for management capabilities, scaling currency, and enterprise support. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Consistent billing metrics based on managed resources, scaling concurrency, and enterprise support area available across all tiers. But let’s be honest &#8211; who needs consistent billing metrics? Half the fun is in the guessing!</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">New Features Include:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Premium security features such as SSO and Policy as Code on all tiers (yes, even the free ones for the poors like us.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Make it “easy and frictionless” for smaller teams and organizations to get started with their first use cases. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">And -finally- updated paid tiers provide easy upgrade paths for organizations as their usage scales, and they have more advanced use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Consumer Advice Time! The updated pricing models include a “per resource” charge. That has the potential to get REAL messy over 500 devices. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Of course, it’s an option to stay on the legacy models, but the “carrots” &#8211; like SSO and Sentinel/OPA support &#8211; are pretty good, so you really just need to do a cost benefit analysis for your particular situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>02:35 Ryan &#8211; “Yeah, I mean, the licensing for Terraform products for cloud and both enterprises always been rough, right? Like starting off per users for cloud makes sense. And at some point for enterprise, they had switched to per project, not users, because they figured out very quickly that what everyone did was just sort of link it together behind automation pane.”</p>
<p>04:48 ”Justin &#8211; the devil&#8217;s in the details of what they consider a resource, right? And it&#8217;s every single thing. I mean, 10 cents per EC2 instance, hmm. Like, yeah, I get 10 cents worth of value out of Terraform, not having to manually do that stuff. So, like, yeah, but then like you get into  S3 buckets and like, I&#8217;m definitely not gonna get 10 cents of value out of an S3 bucket every month.”</p>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<p>00:40 &#8211; News this week starts out with TCP’s own news &#8211; Peter’s podcasting career is riding off into the sunset. He claims he’ll actually start listening, but we’ll see…we’re always happy for more listeners though, no matter how we get them. </p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Have we mentioned the FinOps User Conference? I can’t remember if we’ve mentioned that at all… In any event, join the fun June 27th through the 30th in beautiful and sunny San Diego, and be immersed in all things FinOps. It’s a dream vacation opportunity! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In the meantime, the Finops foundation has announced FOCUS, an open-source initiative designed to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/finops-foundation-launches-new-specification-with-google-and-microsoft-to-demystify-cloud-billing-data-301814080.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">help companies more easily track their cloud costs</a>, which will initially launch at the conference. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The goal of the initiative is to develop a standard specification for organizing cloud spending and usage data. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">According to FinOps, FOCUS will also provide a number of related data management capabilities, MS and Google will join the steering committee tasked with managing the project. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">“FOCUS will solve problems that organizations maturing their cloud adoption now face,” said Udam Dewaraja, the chair of the FinOps Foundation’s FOCUS working group. “Today, there’s no clear way to unify cost and usage data sets across different vendors.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">FOCUS introduces standardized terminology for describing cloud expenses and usage metrics, provides a standardized schema, or a data format in which financial information can be organized. A schema specifies technical details such as the maximum number of expenses that should be included in each database row.</li>

Justin, Ryan, Jonathan, and Matthew are all here this week to discuss the latest news and announcements in the world of cloud and AI &#8211; including New Relic Grok, Athena Provisioned Capacity from AWS, and updates to the Azure Virtual Desktop.</p>
<h3>Titles we almost went with this week:</h3>
<p>None! This week’s title was SO GOOD we didn’t bother with any alternates. Sometimes it’s just like that, you know? </p>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<p>01:27 &#8211; Quick reminder &#8211; <a href="https://x.finops.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Finops X Foundation Conference</a> is almost here! </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This is the annual FinOps Foundation Annual User Conference, and it is taking place June 29th through the 31st in Beautiful San Diego, California. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hundreds of your fellow practitioners will be sharing their FinOps knowledge, collaborating in chalk talks and networking together.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Why should you attend? Great question. Let me tell you. 1) There’s a party on an aircraft carrier. Need more? You got it. 2) You can learn best practices when it comes to FinOps and save your company lots of money &#8211; you’ll be a hero! (Look at the economy and current interest rates. Heroic is an understatement.) Need another reason? Look no further! Justin will be there! We know you’ve always wanted to chat with him in person. No? How about free stickers? Free stuff is good. Everyone loves stickers. </li>
</ul>
<p>02:47 <a href="https://newrelic.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New Relic</a> is back on the pod &#8211; and they’ve got something new </p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/new-relic-launches-grok-its-ai-observability-assistant/?guccounter=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New Relic just launched Grok, their new AI observability assistant </a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">If you remember a few weeks ago, we had someone from New Relic on the pod, and they told us **something** was coming, but weren’t quite ready to tell us what it was &#8211; and now, it’s here! </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">New Relic is throwing their hat into the AI ring &#8211; Grok.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Grok will allow engineers to use large language models to help utilize natural language when performing many of the routine tasks in New Relic, like setting up instrumentation, building reports, or managing accounts.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Engineers can sift through the data more easily and come through their unified telemetry data without having to write complex queries.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">From New Relic: “Observability tools exist to serve the DevOps and DevSecOps movements. Engineers use observability tools to get the data they need to operate and secure the software they build,” said New Relic Chief Product Officer Manav Khurana. “The reality, howeve r, is that it’s hard for every engineer to translate a question they have into a data model, sift through their tools to find the right data, and then translate data back to an insight in natural language. That’s why DevSecOps practices are lagging behind all the innovation in Observability tooling. Now with Generative AI, there will be an explosion of new software developed in a completely different way, creating even more complexity t]]></description>

<li>The Cloud Pod DeepMinds bring you the Cloud News</li>
<li>The Cloud Sounds Better When Tuned Properly</li>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<p>00:43 &#8211; <a href="https://x.finops.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Finops X Foundation Conference</a> is just around the corner </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This is a great opportunity to meet with other Finops users and share knowledge, collaborate on Chalk Talk, and network in beautiful <a href="https://www.sandiego.org/explore/things-to-do.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">San Diego</a>, CA. There will even be an awards ceremony on an aircraft carrier, and you KNOW you want to be there for that. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Do you like stickers? Of course you do. Everyone likes stickers! Be on the lookout for Justin &#8211; he’ll be there! And if you ask nicely (or even just sort of nicely) he’ll give you a TCP sticker, so that right there is a great reason to attend. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The conference is June 29th &#8211; 31st, and registration can be found on the <a href="https://x.finops.org/register/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Finops Foundation website</a>. See you there!  </li>
</ul>
<p>02:51 It’s earning season. Listener discretion is advised. </p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Let’s start with Microsoft</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">At their earnings report on Tuesday, Microsoft is reporting $52.9 billion revenue, up 7% from the previous year. Expectations were set at $51 billion.  Much of this is driven by AI (because what isn’t driven by AI these days.) </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Overall profits were up 9% from last year, coming in at $18.3 billion. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Microsoft Azure helped with these numbers by recording a 22% increase, vs. a 34% increase seen last year.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>03:51 Ryan- I’m surprised with some of the numbers, just because I wasn’t expecting &#8211; after so many years of growth &#8211; that it would continue to rise despite the economic dip.”</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Moving on to Google Earnings… </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Google earnings were recorded at $69.79 billion, which was higher than analysts expected, thanks partly due to Google cloud revenue and an increase in Youtube advertising (all of it aimed at my kid, apparently.) </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Google cloud (GCI) revenue came in at $7.45 billion, which was slightly lower than expectations, but the good news is that Google<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/googles-cloud-business-turns-profitable-for-the-first-time-on-record.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> finally recorded a profit</a> in their cloud computing sector! This means everyone using GCI won’t be left in the dust, since we all know Google loves to kill off anything that isn’t profitable. </li>

<li>Azure gets an AI, Google gets an AI… and Amazon finally gets an AI</li>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<h2>AWS News</h2>
<p>@01:36 &#8211; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-codewhisperer-free-for-individual-use-is-now-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Codewhisperer is now generally available &#8211; and includes a free tier</a>! </p>
<ul>
<li>-Besides just the availability, this new real-time AI coding companion also includes a FREE individual tier open to all developers. This is a (good!) surprise to us. </li>
<li>-The free tier works with many popular IDEs, including VS Code and Intellij IDEA among others. </li>
<li>-Codewhisperer can assist in productivity by creating code for repetitive or routine tasks</li>
<li>&#8211; Cost wise, Codewhisperer is pretty much in line with other products like GitHub Copilot. </li>
<li>&#8211; Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell Scripting, SQL and Scala </li>
<li>-The downside: security is fairly limited (Python and Java, for instance) </li>
<li>02:50 Jonathan: “I’m super happy that they’ve launched with so many languages supported, and so much support for different IDE’s. It’s a great launch. It’s definitely a time saver, and I’d pay the $20 a month for the service even if there wasn’t a free tier.”</li>
<li>(But maybe we don’t say that too loudly, or the free tier will disappear…)</li>
<li>And speaking of that free tier &#8211;</li>
<li>04:49 Jonathan: “I expect the reason there’s a free tier is so that they get much more data from user experiences, and can retrain the model based on people’s feedback.”</li>
<li>05:24 Ryan: “It’s edging us closer to code writing code.”</li>
<li>-One of the things that is important to point out from our discussion today is that you can get a bit more for your money from <a href="https://resources.github.com/copilot-for-business/?ef_id=_k_9a140a2d0f2c126b3f8f6e652bcf31d8_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmc3fhtaow_SEM__k_9a140a2d0f2c126b3f8f6e652bcf31d8_k_&amp;msclkid=9a140a2d0f2c126b3f8f6e652bcf31d8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Copilot</a>, which also <a href="https://github.com/pricing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">has a free tier for individuals</a>. </li>

<ul>
<li>-SDAS is an open source solution, available under the Apache License, and can be deployed directly from your AWS account</li>
<li>-Do you have a problem with being able to safely archive data from your databases? According to Amazon this is a wide ranging problem for many folks, and since storing data on-premises can be extremely costly, this may be a great alternative. </li>

<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<h3>General News</h3>
<p>@00:57 &#8211; Interesting article &#8211; <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-openai-is-doing-that-google-isnt" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">What is Open AI doing that Google Isn’t </a></p>
<ul>
<li>(Besides making a usable product, obviously.) </li>
<li>-Google AI lab is separate, meaning researchers are separate from the engineers, versus Open AI where they are one combined team, which &#8211; go figure &#8211; works out better. -The article goes on to question whether Google is “losing their edge” which, as the number 3 player in the AI industry, is pretty evident. The guys discuss the two services, as well as how Bard can be crammed into every product Google makes. </li>
<li>02:49 Ryan: “I find it kind of fascinating that Open AI, because they were first to market, gets to dictate what AI is.”</li>
</ul>
<p>@07:01 Are you an AI developer? Are you looking to build out your own models? -Good luck. Finding the hardware to do that continues to be an issue. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Information put out an<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-developers-stymied-by-server-shortage-at-aws-microsoft-google" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> article about a shortage of servers at all the major cloud companies</a>, including AWS, Azure, GPC, and OCI. The biggest issue is a shortage of GPUs and GPU processors, which was one of the first and main resources to have supply chain issues. </li>
<li>Desktop computer GPUs are having less issues with supply. Some of that is thanks to the bottom falling out of the Bitcoin market (no need for mining anymore.)</li>
<li>07:57 Ryan &#8211; “It’s a run on a limited resource, and GPU’s &#8211; they were the first to hit supply chain issue… it’s always been sort of a scarce resource. When I first heard of GPU’s being used for machine learning and those types of workloads, there weren’t enough of them, and it wasn’t really embedded in the type of hardware you need to run in a data center.</li>
<li>09:07Justin &#8211; “A lot of GPU returns and GPU availability in the desktop market, which those GPU’s are better suited for doing high computational work of 3D and things that are required for getting to bitcoin… so you could use desktop GPUs but your experience won’t go as far.”</li>
<li>Unfortunately the smart British guy isn’t here to tell us all the ins and outs of the differences between types of GPUs, so do tune in for that next week!</li>
</ul>
<p>@10:37 FinOps slack channels had some chatter in regards to the Amazon spot market pricing increases. </p>
<ul>
<li>For the past couple weeks prices have continued to grow in US East 1, US AP Southeast 1A, and European servers (which are always more expensive anyway) among others. Justin discusses his ideas for why this is the case. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly at all) most of his theoretical reasons for these prices increases are pretty cynical &#8211; but they include capacity constraints in the supply chain, Amazon limiting additional buying because they’re going into e]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<h2>AWS Puts Up a New VPC Lattice to Ease the Growth of Your Connectivity</h2>
<p>AKA Welcome to April (how is it April already?) This week, Justin, Jonathan, and Matt are your guides through all the latest and greatest in Cloud news; including VPC Lattice from AWS, the one and only time we’ll talk about Service Catalog, and an ultra premium DDoS experience. All this week on The Cloud Pod. </p>
<h3>This week’s alternate title(s):</h3>
<ul>
<li>AWS Finally makes service catalogs good with Terraform</li>
<li>Amazon continues to believe retailers with supply chain will give all their data to them</li>
<li>Azure copies your data from S3… AWS copies your data from Azure Blobs… or how I set money on fire with data egress charges</li>
</ul>
<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>@00:56 &#8211;  Lots from AWS – Terraform and Service Catalog, Supply Chain and its crazy pricing, and VPC Lattice </p>
<p>&#8211;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-self-service-provisioning-of-terraform-open-source-configurations-with-aws-service-catalog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Self-service provisioning of Terraform</a> open source configured with AWS Service Catalog. This means you can define your service catalog resources with either cloud formation *or* Terraform. And yes, Service Catalog inception is potentially a viable thing. </p>
<p>Matt: “It’s useful when you want to give people who don’t know what they’re doing very specific things; if you’re in a large organization, really just defining exactly what people can do…but to me it really starts to remove a lot of the innovation… but if you really want your teams to leverage the cloud and innovate I feel like it does start to limit some of the different aspects of the cloud.”</p>
<p>Justin: “Don’t drink the ITSM kool-aid on Service Catalog.”</p>
<p>@ 04:32 &#8211; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/aws-supply-chain-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Supply Chain is now generally available</a>; and yes, this is the same Supply Chain that was introduced at re:Invent. AWS says it will help mitigate risks, lower costs, increase visibility and help give actual insights on the supply chain.</p>
<p>-Honestly, we’re talking about Supply Chain because the pricing is all over the place. For example, the first 100,000 Supply Chain insights are .40/each; the next 900,000 are .13/each, and over 900,000 its .065/each. </p>
<p>@ 09:26 &#8211; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-service-to-service-connectivity-security-and-monitoring-with-amazon-vpc-lattice-now-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VPC Lattice is finally here</a>! Also announced at re:Invent, this gives you the ability to connect, secure, &amp; monitor communications between services. It also gives the ability to refine policies for both traffic management and network access. </p>
<p>-Since the announcement, a few new capabilities have been added, including the ability to use custom domains, deploy open source AWS gateway API controllers to use Lattice with a Kubernetes-native experience, as well as giving the ability to configure SSL/TLS certificates when using HTTPS that matches the custom domain. </p>
<p>You can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the Kubernetes gateway API to connect services across multiple clusters</li>
<li>use an ALB or an NLB as a target for service</li>
<li>support IPv6 connectivity with IP address target type</li>
<li>-be confused by pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>Justin: “Their examples of Lattice pricing hurts my brain just a little bit.”</p>
<p>@ 13:36 &#8211; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-guardduty-now-supports-amazon-eks-runtime-monitoring/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Guard Duty now supports Amazon EKS Runtime monitoring</a>, which lets you detect Runtime threats from over 30 security findings via an EKS add on, which gives increased visibility on individual container Runtime activity.

	<description><![CDATA[<h2>Andrew Krug from Datadog</h2>
<p><em>In this episode, </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewkrug/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Andrew Krug</em></strong></a> <em>talks about Datadog as a security observability tool, shedding light on some of its applications as well as its benefits to engineers.</em></p>
<p><em>Andrew is the lead in Datadog Security Advocacy and Datadog Security Labs. Also a Cloud Security consultant, he started the Threat Response Project, a toolkit for Amazon Web Services first responders. Andrew has also spoken at Black Hat USA, DEFCON, re:Invent, and other platforms..</em></p>
<h2><strong>DataDog Product Overview</strong></h2>
<p><em>Datadog is focused on bringing security to engineering teams, not just security people. One of the biggest advantages of Datadog or other vendors is how they ingest and normalize various log sources. It can be very challenging to maintain a reasonable data structure for logs ingested from cloud providers. </em></p>
<p><em>Vendors try to provide customers with enough signals that they feel they are getting value while trying not to flood them with unactionable alerts. Also, considering the cloud friendliness for the stack is crucial for clients evaluating a new product. </em></p>
<p><em>Datadog is active in the open-source community and gives back to groups like the Cloud native computing foundation. One of their popular open-source security tools created is Stratus-red-team which simulates the techniques of attackers in a clean room environment. The criticality of findings is becoming a major topic. It is necessary when evaluating that criticality is based on how much risk applies to the business, and what can be done. </em></p>
<p><em>One of the things that teams struggle with as high maturity DevOps is trying to automate incident handling or response to critical alerts as this can cause <strong>Configuration Drift</strong> which is why there is a lot of hesitation to fully automate things. Having someone to make hard choices is at the heart of incident handling processes. </em></p>
<p><em>Datadog Cloud SIEM was created to help customers who were already customers of logs. Datadog SIEM is also very easy to use such that without being a security expert, the UI is simple. It is quite difficult to deploy a SIEM on completely unstructured logs, hence being able to extract and normalize data to a set of security attributes is highly beneficial. Interestingly, the typical boring hygienic issues that are easy to detect still cause major problems for very large companies. This is where posture management comes in to address issues on time and prevent large breaches. </em></p>
<p><em>Generally, Datadog is inclined towards moving these detections closer to the data that they are securing, and examining the application run time in real-time to verify that there are no issues. Datadog would be helpful to solve IAM challenges through CSPM which evaluates policies. For engineering teams, the benefit is seen in how information surfaces in areas where they normally look, especially with Datadog Security products where Issues are sorted in order of importance. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Security Observability Day is coming up on the 18th of April </em></strong><em>when Datadog products will be highlighted; t<strong>he link to sign up is available on the </strong></em><a href="https://www.twitter.com/datadoghq/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Datadog Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em> page </em></strong><em>and </em><a href="https://chat.datadoghq.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Datadog community Slack</em></strong></a><em>.

	<description><![CDATA[<h3>This week on the podcast, Justin, Jonathan and Ryan are joined by Matt Kohn and can be found chatting about all things microservices and containers &#8211; including new Security Copilot features.  In our cloud journeys, we discuss just what defines a microservice (spoiler: the guys actually agree for once) and whether or not those microservices require containers. Also on the agenda, IS Kubernetes the new Monolith? </h3>
<h2>News this Week:</h2>
<p>@4:00  &#8211; HashiCorp has announced quite a few updates for Terraform, including a number of innovations for the cloud version. This includes:</p>
<p>-A *new version of the UI (*not actually new if you use the cloud version) and a new cross organizational provider, which will allow users to share via a private registry across an organization. </p>
<p>-They introduced Projects, which will give the ability to organize workspaces and ownership boundaries within Terraform. </p>
<p>-An Auth update will give enhanced integration between Terraform and GitHub.com</p>
<p>-But wait, there’s more from HashiCorp! Among the updates is a new and improved pipeline model called the TFE Taskworker. This will let Terraform offer features like OPA support, dynamic provider credentials, and drift detection. </p>
<p>From Justin: “And OPA is exactly what you thought &#8211; they’re getting rid of Sentinel. No. They’re not. They’re giving you OPA AND Sentinel so you can use either/or or both of them.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-enterprise-adds-projects-drift-detection-and-more" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Terraform Enterprise adds projects, drift detection, and more</a></p>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p>@7:57 In AWS News &#8211;  We discussed a few weeks ago the new app migration service from AWS; well, they’ve added three new features! </p>
<p>-Import/Export: You can use the App Migration Service to import source environment inventory list from a CSV file (snazzy!) as well as exporting that same data for reporting purposes, offline reviews, and update integration. </p>
<p>&#8211; New dashboard for server migration metrics and added 8 additional predefined actions, such as converting licenses to Amazon licensing.  </p>
<p>&#8211; ALB’s now support TLS 1.3 (Did anyone else realize they hadn’t already offered that update?)</p>
<p>Matt: “I think what scares me more is the Windows update version; they have a runbook that will just do the upgrade for you. I feel like that **definitely** will never end well.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-application-migration-service-major-updates-import-and-export-feature-source-server-migration-metrics-dashboard-and-additional-post-launch-actions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Application Migration Service Major Updates: Import and Export Feature, Source Server Migration Metrics Dashboard, and Additional Post-Launch Actions</a></h3>
<h2>GCP </h2>
<p>@14:04 &#8211; Nothing of interest from GCP this week. Still trying to get Bard to work, go figure. Google recently discussed their “shared agenda for sensible AI progress” which is essentially an “if you can’t beat ‘em &#8211; regulate ‘em” ideology.</p>
<p>SIDENOTE: Weird Amazon returns policies </p>
<p>SIDENOTE: AI Startup Replika &#8211; it goes where you think it does. (Hint: Where the internet ALWAYS goes.) </p>
<h2>Azure </h2>
<p>@ 20:19 &#8211; Moving on to Azure &#8211; Microsoft’s inaugural Security event says they are “bringing the power of AI to security” but *are* they? The announcement doesn’t tell us much, but it essentially marries GPT to Security Copilot. But is this really a product they need to be selling? The guys discuss what GOOD AI integration would look like for InfoSec. </p>
<p>Ryan: “I can’t get the image out of my head of Clippy wearing a badge saying ‘Would you like to open a Sev1 incident’?”</p>
<p>Justin: “Just because you have the big partnership with Open AI for billions of dollars doesn’t mean every one of your products ha]]></description>

	<title>TCP-Talks: Evolution of NoSQL with Couchbase CTO, Ravi Mayuram</title>
	<link>https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/couchbase-ravi-mayuram/</link>
	<pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 23:49:17 +0000</pubDate>
	<dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Brodley, Jonathan Baker, Ryan Lucas and Matthew Kohn]]></dc:creator>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=15395</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p><em>In this episode, Ravi Mayuram highlights the functionality of Couchbase as an evolutionary database platform, citing several simple day-to-day use cases and particular advantages of Couchbase.</em></p>
<p><em>Ravi Mayuram is CTO of Couchbase. He is an accomplished engineering executive with a passion for creating and delivering game-changing products for startups as well as Fortune-500 industry-leading companies.</em></p>
<p><strong>Notes </strong></p>
<p><em>Couchbase set out to build a next-generation database. Data has evolved greatly with IT advancements. The goal was to build a database that will connect people to the newer technologies, addressing problems that relational systems did not have to solve. The fundamental shift is that earlier systems were internally focused, built for trained users but now the systems are built directly for consumers. This shift also plays out in the vast difference in the number of consumers now interacting with these systems compared to the fewer trained users previously interacting with the systems. </em></p>
<p><em>One of the key factors that sets Couchbase apart is the No-SQL Database. It is a database that has evolved by combining five systems; a Cache and Key-value store, a Document store, a Relational document store, a Search system, and an Analytical system. Secondly, Couchbase performs well in the geo-distributed manner such that with one click, data is made available across availability zones. Lastly, all of this can be done at a large scale in seconds. </em></p>
<p><em>Regarding the global database concept that Google talks about, a globally consistent database may not be needed by most companies. The performance will be the biggest problem as transaction speed will be considerably low. Couchbase does these transactions locally within the data center and replicates them on the other side. The main issue of relational systems is that they make you pay the price of every transaction no matter how minor, but with Couchbase, it is possible to pay only the cost only with certain crucial transactions. </em></p>
<p><em>Edge has become a part of the enterprise architecture even such that people now have edge-based solutions. Two edges are emerging; the Network edge and the Tool edge where people are interfacing. Couchbase has built a mobile database available on devices, with sync capability.</em></p>
<p><em>As a consumer, the primary advantage of bringing data closer to the consumer is the latency issue. Often, data has to go through firewalls and multiple steps which delays it but this is the benefit of Couchbase. The user simply continues to have access to the data while Couchbase synchronizes the data in the back. </em></p>
<p><em>One of the applications of Couchbase in healthcare is insulin tracking. With many devices that monitor insulin which must work everywhere you go, Couchbase Lite does the insulin tracking, keeps the data even in the absence of a network, and later syncs it for review by healthcare professionals. This is also useful in operating rooms where the network is not accessible. The real benefit is seen when the data eventually gets back to the server and can be interpreted to make decisions on patient care. </em></p>
<p><em>The Couchbase Capella Service runs in the cloud and allows clients to specify what data should be sent to the edge and what should not be. This offers privacy and security measures, such that even in the loss or damage of a device, the data is secure and can be recovered. To effectively manage edge in devices, a lot of problems must be addressed to make it easier. </em></p>
<p><em>One of the concerns for anyone coming into Couchbase Capella is the expense of data extraction from the cloud, however, Couchbase is available on all three cloud providers.

	<title>TCP-Talks: Revolutionizing Observability with New Relic featuring Daniel Kim</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<h2>Revolutionizing Observability with New Relic</h2>
<p><em>In this episode, Daniel explains a new strategy towards observability aimed at contextualizing large volumes of data to make it easier for users to identify the root cause of problems with their systems.</em></p>
<p><em>Daniel Kim is a Principal Developer Relations Engineer at New Relic and the founder of Bit Project, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to making tech accessible to under-served communities. His job is basically to get developers excited about Observability, and he hopes to inspire students to maximize their potential in tech through inclusive, accessible developer education. He is passionate about diversity and inclusion in tech, good food, and dad jokes. </em></p>
<h2>Show Notes</h2>
<p><em>First, it is important to differentiate between monitoring and observability. Monitoring is basically when a code is instrumented to send data to a backend, to give answers to preconceived questions. With Observability, the goal is to monitor your system so as to later ask questions that were not in mind during the instrumentation of the system. Hence, if something new comes up you can find the root cause without modifying the code. There are so many levels of things to check when troubleshooting to find the cause of a problem, and this is where observability comes in. </em></p>
<p><em>There are different use cases for logs, metrics, and traces; Logs are files that record events, warnings, or errors however logs are ephemeral which means there is increased risk of losing a lot of data. A system needs to be in place to move logs to a central source. Another issue with logs is that it is poorly structured data. Logs are good to have as the last step of observability. Metrics and traces can however help to narrow down where to search in the logs to solve an issue. </em></p>
<p><em>Metrics are measurements that reflect the performance or health of your applications. They give an overview of how the systems are doing but tend to not be very specific in finding the root cause of a problem; other forms of data have to be adopted to get a clear picture. This is where Traces come in. </em></p>
<p><em>Traces are pieces of data that track a request as it goes through the system. Because of this, they can identify the root cause of an error or bottlenecks slowing down the system. However, they are very expensive and as such sampling is used when tracing but this reduces the accuracy of traces. Correlating information from logs, metrics, and traces gives a full clear picture for debugging to be carried out successfully. A lot of New Relic customers strive to get more pieces of data to get errors faster. </em></p>
<p><em>To balance the right data at the right time with the right cost, the first step when collecting large amounts of data is to find out how your organization is leveraging the data. A quick audit of the data to identify useful data is helpful. This can be done monthly or quarterly. Unstructured logs are difficult to aggregate </em></p>
<p><em>In the cloud native space, being able to be compatible with as many people as possible will determine the winners because there are many projects people use in production. Projects that are compatible with many other projects are the way forward. </em></p>
<p><em>APM is still very useful to understand application performance and in the future, data from all sources will be correlated to figure out the cause of a problem. Getting value very early from the system involves having a solid infrastructure and installing APM. The real power of full stack observability is getting data from different parts of your stack so you can diagnose what part of your system is going wrong. Leveraging AI to make sense of large amounts of data for engineers is going to be a huge plus. </em></p>
<p><em>A lot of vendors claim that their alert systems will automatically generate all alerts for you but this is not true because they would not know your ]]></description>

	<title>TCP-Talks:  A New Approach to Spatial Simulations with Rahul Thakkar</title>

	<description><![CDATA[Spatial Simulations with AWS SimSpace Weaver
<p>In this episode, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/about-us/">Peter</a> sits with Rahul Thakkar to discuss the revolutionary <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AWS SimSpace Weaver</a>, highlighting its unique function and applications across several industries.</p>
<p>Rahul Thakkar is the Director and General Manager of Simulation Technologies at Amazon Web Services. Before AWS, he held multiple executive roles at Boeing, Brivo, PIXIA, and DreamWorks Animation. He is an inventor, and global technology executive with a background in cloud computing, distributed and high-performance computing, media and entertainment, film, television, defense and intelligence, aerospace, and access control.</p>
<p>His film credits include Shrek, Antz, and Legend of Bagger Vance. In 2002, he was part of the team that won an Academy Award for Shrek as the Best Animated Feature. Again in 2016, at the 88th Annual Academy Awards, Thakkar received a Technical Achievement Award.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS SimSpace Weaver</a> enables customers to run extremely large-scale spatial simulations without having to manage any of the underlying infrastructure. It also removes the complexity of state management of entities as they move about the simulation. Previously, carrying out such simulations would be done sequentially, in a cumbersome manner over years but now it can be done in parallel in weeks. Different organizations have tried out this functionality for several scenarios and the results have been amazing. This value was largely made possible due to the approach of working with customer feedback.</p>
<p>Rahul&#8217;s interest in the cloud came much later in his career which started initially in the R&amp;D department of the Motion Picture industry where he created many of the complex graphics in movies. He later moved into a small start-up that was developing technologies for satellite imagery and mapping, and from here he moved to aerospace. Generally, he observed the problem that it is very expensive for companies to maintain their infrastructure when dealing with simulations. It also would drain resources and distract from the main focus of the company. Eventually, knew he had to use AWS, and now he works with them.</p>
<p>All the other primitive tools within AWS are being consumed to build the service. There is also the ability to write to S3 so that customers can write the simulations out. This helps customers to remember how the simulation played out.</p>
<p>Relating this new service to the metaverse, Rahul believes that when it comes to the metaverse, each organization has its vision of what it should be. However, AWS built the tools to empower these organizations to build their metaverses. Despite the possibility of having competition from Azure or GCP, the focus of AWS would remain on the customer and their needs, innovation on their behalf.</p>
<p>Identifying new problems that the service would be very applicable for is a great challenge that AWS relies on customers for, to help AWS envision where they want to go with the service. There are definitely many companies running simulations but it is hard to predict how many would migrate to the AWS SimSpace Weaver because it is still a new product. Nonetheless, a lot of industries are interested in this new service. These include smart cities, organizations ranging from local to federal or international, logistics and supply chains, large-scale event planning, or any situation where there is a need to simulate a large problem with digital replicas of the real world.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Quotes </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li> &#8220;The fact that we worked from the customer backwards is something that allowed us to deliver the kind of value that they&#8217;re getting right now with AWS SimSpace Weaver&#8221;</li>]]></description>

	<title>TCP Talks: Applying and Maximizing Observability with Christine Yen</title>
	<link>https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/maximizing-observability-christine-yen/</link>
	<pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 10:37:36 +0000</pubDate>

	<description><![CDATA[Applying and Maximizing Observability
<p>In this episode, Christine talks about her company, <a href="http://www.honeycomb.io" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Honeycomb</a> which runs on AWS, with the goal of promoting observability for clients interested in the performance of their code or those trying to identify problem areas that need to be corrected.</p>
<p>Christine Yen is the Co-Founder and CEO of Honeycomb. Before founding Honeycomb, she built analytics products at Parse/Facebook and loved writing software to separate signals from noise. Christine delights in being a developer in a room full of ops folks. Outside of work, Christine is kept busy by her two dogs and wants your sci-fi &amp; fantasy book recommendations.</p>
<h2><strong>Notes </strong></h2>
<p>Honeycomb is an observability platform that helps customers understand why their code is behaving differently from what they expected. The inspiration behind this software came after Christine’s previous company was acquired by Facebook and they realized how software made it very easy to identify problems in large code data within a short time. This encouraged them to build the tool and make it available to all engineers.</p>
<p>If the first wave of DevOps was Ops-people learning how to automate their working code, the second wave would be helping developers learn to operate their code. Honeycomb is designed intentionally to ensure that all types of engineers can make sense of the tool.</p>
<p>Honeycomb has always come up with ways for customers to use AWS products and get the data reflected in Honeycomb to be manipulated. Over the last few months, they have ensured that it is possible for clients to plug into CloudWatch Log and CloudWatch metrics, and redirect data directly from AWS products into Honeycomb instead. Clients can also use Honeycomb to extract data based on what their applications are doing. This applies to performance optimization, experimentation, or any situation where a company wants to try a code to see how it performs on production. The focus remains on the application layer. Before Honeycomb, no one was using observability in this context.</p>
<p>The pricing of Honeycomb is based on the volume of data, which makes it predictable and understandable. Unlike when the pricing scale is based on the fidelity of the data, which can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Challenges within the observability space: The question is how to help new engineers learn from the seasoned engineers on the team through paper trails left by the seasoned engineers. This is a problem that can only be solved by enabling teams to orient new engineers on their systems without having to create another question as part of the code.</p>
<p>Building an AI Approach in Honeycomb may not be suitable because of the context involved, since training effective machine learning models relies on a vast amount of easily classifiable data and this does not apply in the world of software; every engineering team&#8217;s systems are different from every other engineering team&#8217;s systems. Honeycomb is interested in using Al to build these models in order to help users know what questions to ask.</p>
<p>With Honeycomb, usage patterns are much more dependent on the curiosity and proficiency of the engineering team; while some engineers who are used to getting answers directly may just leave the software, those who have a culture of asking questions will benefit more from it.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Quotes </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li> &#8220;Not having to predict ahead of time what matters, is making such a difference in our ability as engineers to get ahead of issues, identify them quickly, resolve them&#8221;</li>
<li> &#8220;We&#8217;re out of a world where any individual engineer holds the entire system in their head&#8221;</li>
<li> &#8220;Observability is the only way forward as we make our worlds ever less predictable&#8221;</li>
</ul>]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p><em>On this episode of The Cloud Pod, the team sits to talk about AWS&#8217;s new patching policies, the general availability of Azure OpenAI, and the role of addressing IM or access management challenges in ensuring the seamless transition to the Cloud.</em></p>
<p><em>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, </em><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn/"><em>Foghorn Consulting</em></a><em>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</em></p>
<h3><strong>This week’s highlights</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces new patching policies,</li>
<li> Azure OpenAI service is now generally available.</li>
<li> IM/Access Management in CCOE&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top Quotes </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> &#8220;I think it(access management) should be the first challenge that&#8217;s tackled, and I usually try to approach it as such but it&#8217;s also sort of hard to do when it starts off as an experiment…and you have to retrofit it in”</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>AWS: Announcement of new patching policies</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/01/aws-systems-manager-patch-policies-cross-account-region-patching/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Systems Manager announces Patch Policies, enabling cross account and cross Region patching</a></li>
<li> This allows users to deploy policies to enforce patch compliance across their AWS accounts and regions&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Azure: Azure OPN AI service is now generally available.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>0&#x20e3; <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/general-availability-of-azure-openai-service-expands-access-to-large-advanced-ai-models-with-added-enterprise-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General availability of Azure OpenAI Service expands access to large, advanced AI models with added enterprise benefits</a></li>
<li>0&#x20e3; This is Close to Jonathan&#8217;s prediction that Azure will launch a ChatGPT service, and more businesses can now access the most advanced AI models with pricing based on the mode of use..</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Cloud Journey Series; The Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>IM or Access management should be the first area people look at and the first challenge to be tackled, while also defining data protection boundaries.</li>
<li>CCOE also provides the opportunity to identify activities in production that are unnecessary and should be changed.</li>
<li>Permissions are the least important part of your IM journey; permissions change and would need to be evaluated continually.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>For our New Years Resolution, we decided to change some of our show.

<p><em>On this episode of The Cloud Pod, the team follows up on the news from Salesforce&#8217;s last episode, as workforce cuts ensue as a fallout of the noted decline in productivity, with more on 2023 predictions from Peter, including general expectations in the tech space, while also highlighting the new Graph-explorer tool by Amazon Neptune, GCP security trends for the coming year, the CES Conference and CCOE from the new Cloud Journey Series.</em></p>

<li> The Cloud Journey Series; The Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top Quotes </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> &#8220;A lot of traditional security operations has been at the infrastructure level; tracking packets and using the header information of those packets for identification, and none of that really works on cloud anymore&#8221;</li>
<li> &#8220;It&#8217;s not just how to use cloud technology, which is what the IT teams were focused on, it&#8217;s how do you provide the value of cloud into your business and succeed?&#8221;</li>
<li> &#8220;Understanding the advantages of why you want to adopt Cloud is really important for a business, even before they start the CCOE&#8221;<strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> </strong></li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p><em>On this episode of The Cloud Pod, the team wraps up 2022 so far, comparing predictions made with the events so far while projecting into 2023 as the year comes to a close. They discuss the S3 security changes coming from Amazon, the new control plane connectivity options with GCP, and Microsoft&#8217;s achievement, finally topping a list within the cloud space. </em></p>
<p><em>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, </em><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn/"><em>Foghorn Consulting</em></a><em>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</em></p>
<h3><strong>This week’s highlights</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> Starting in April, Amazon will change defaults around S3 security.</li>
<li> The new control plane connectivity and isolation options are coming to GKE clusters</li>
<li> Finally, Microsoft is Number #1 In a Cloud Thing.</li>
<li> Salesforce Founder, Marc Benioff says employees hired during the pandemic are facing much lower productivity.</li>
<li> Open AI&#8217;s new chat AI and AI playground create much buzz but with high compute costs, it will be monetized soon.</li>
<li> A lookback at 2022 predictions by our hosts, none of which came true.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Top Quotes </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> &#8220;The problem with low-code No-code… is that the gap between those solutions and the bespoke development that you typically would meet is mountains of distance but with this [Open AI&#8217;s new chat AI] ..now I just have to tell the computer what I&#8217;m trying to do…and then the computer can determine what type of code to write for that&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2023 Predictions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> Jonathan: Microsoft will release in preview of an Azure branded Chat GPT</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p><em>On The Cloud Pod the team reviews the multi-billion-dollar DOD contract formerly known as Jedi awarded to big tech companies; Microsoft buys a stake in LSE, raising questions; Werner shares his 2023 tech predictions and posts the Distributed Computing manifesto to his blog; and lastly, at Azure, Bell hits bumps while trying to make Microsoft safer. </em></p>
<p><em>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, </em><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn/"><em>Foghorn Consulting</em></a><em>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</em></p>
<h3><strong>This week’s highlights</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> The Pentagon awards a cloud-computing contract that can reach up to $9 billion in total through 2028 to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle.</li>
<li> Microsoft buys 4% stake in the London Stock Exchange</li>
<li> AWS: Werner posts the Distributed Computing Manifesto to his blog All Things Distributed and shares his 2023 tech predictions.</li>
<li> GCP: Break down data silos with the new cross-cloud transfer feature of BigQuery Omni</li>
<li> Azure: Bell hits obstacles in his push to make Microsoft more secure as feedback suggests the bar is being set too high.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top Quotes </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> &#8220;The long and the short of it is that slowly over time, the ship date when buying something on Amazon or anywhere else gets closer to real-time and the cost to get it to you gets lower&#8221;</li>
<li> “All software has defects since it’s created and configured by humans, [But] the pattern of security incidents [and] defects in Azure reported by third parties and the related severity suggests that even Microsoft is challenged in adopting proper security controls in cloud-native development pipelines, like many enterprises.”</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>AWS: ALL THINGS DISTRIBUTED – WERNER VOGELS’ BLOG</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> Werner posted the Distributed Computing Manifesto to his blog “All Things Distributed”.</li>
<li> The manifesto highlights the challenges Amazon was facing at the end of the 20th century, and hints at where it was headed.</li>
<li> He also shared his 2023 tech predictions on the blog involving cloud technology, simulated worlds, silicone chips supply chain transformation, and smart energy..</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>GCP: </strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bq-omnis-cross-cloud-transfer-now-generally-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Break down data silos with the new cross-cloud transfer feature of BigQuery Omni</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>0&#x20e3; GCP launched big query Omni in 2021 to help customers break down data silos.</li>
<li> They have now added support for SQL-supported Load Statements that allowed AWS/Azure Blob data to be brought into big query as a managed table for advanced analysis.</li>
<li> Feedback confirms improvements in usability, security, latency, and cost audibility.<strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> </strong></li>

<ul>
<li> After spending 23 years at Amazon, Charlie Bell, the most senior cybersecurity executive now at Microsoft, faces resistance to preventing and responding to software vulnerabilities believing that he was setting the bar too high.</li>
<li> If there are flaws in the software they write that leads to vulnerabilities for downtime, developers in bell’s unit can expect to be paged and asked to fix it. This is long-standing practice at AWS but a new concep]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>The Cloud Pod recaps all of the positives and negatives of Amazon ReInvent 2022, the annual conference in Las Vegas, bringing together 50,000 cloud computing professionals.  This year&#8217;s keynote speakers include Adam Selpisky, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Data and Machine Learning at AWS and Werner Vogels, Amazon&#8217;s CTO.  Attendees and web viewers were treated to new features and products, such as AWS Lambda Snapstart for Java Functions, New Quicksight capabilities and quality-of-life improvements to hundreds of services.  Justin, Jonathan, Ryan, Peter and Special guest Joe Daly from the Finops foundation talk about the show and the announcements.</p>

<h2>Top Quote</h2>
<p> <em>“But if I&#8217;m putting my business data into another data lake, and I want to use the business data to inform my security data, I now have to cross the lakes to even make this connection to get that data set. So I agree with you on a pure security basis in the open schema for security data is really great. My issue is that you&#8217;re putting borders around these lakes, when you really want to bring the data together and be able to hydrate across. That&#8217;s why we have enterprise data, we analyze data warehouses, where we have all these things to bring this data together, add context to data. And I feel like this is just more removing context.” [37:20]</em></p>

<p> “I get the feeling that the multiple tenancy, in a way is probably the selling point here. That as you acquire new companies, or as you bring on new partners dynamically, it&#8217;s easier to integrate those IDPs. Whereas previously, it&#8217;s been pretty difficult to to have multiple sources of identity, I guess it sort of abstracts those and provides a single layer to the Google identity service.” [22:07”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team weighs the merits of bitcoin mining versus hacking. Plus: AWS Trusted Advisor prioritizes Support customers, Google provides impenetrable protection from a major DDoS attack, and Oracle Linux 9 is truly unbreakable.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS Trusted Advisor offers a new Priority capability for Enterprise Support, offering a prioritized view of critical risks.</li>
<li> Nothing’s touching Google, as it blocks the largest Layer 7 DDoS attack to date, with a whopping 46 million requests per second (RPS).</li>
<li> The new Oracle Linux 9 comes with Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 7 (UEK R7) and Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK).</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “This is really just institutionalizing the knowledge that the Enterprise customers are already getting from their account team. And it probably really helps — in the event that the AWS account team experiences churn for those customers — not to be negatively impacted. It probably makes it really easy for new people on that AWS account team to come in and know where the other team left off. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really a new feature — just a new way to access data that customers are already getting.”</li>
<li> “Ignoring those Tor nodes — which didn&#8217;t make a whole lot of traffic — that&#8217;s 12,000 requests a second per source IP, on average. That&#8217;s enormous.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: A Trusty Advisor’s Priorities</h3>
<ul>
<li> Finally, AWS has found a use for Mechanical Turk, with its new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-trusted-advisor-new-priority-capability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Priority capability for Trust Advisor</a>.</li>
<li> If you&#8217;ve been curious about what&#8217;s happening during domain updates of the OpenSearch Service, you now get <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/amazon-opensearch-improved-visibility-validation-errors-blue-green-deployments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more visibility into validation errors during blue/green deployments</a>.</li>
<li> Great news for license-holders and clearly by popular demand: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/amazon-rds-oracle-supports-managed-oracle-data-guard-switchover-automated-backups-replicas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RDS for Oracle now supports managed Oracle Data Guard Switchover and Automated Backups for read replicas</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Heavily Armored Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/08/17/google-cloud-discontinue-iot-core-service-2023/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Cloud is saying goodbye to its IoT Core service in 2023. How about instead of turning it off, just stop selling it? </a></li>
<li> You can benefit from operating system Committed Use Discounts (CUD) with workload predictability. Now, get some cuts on your <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/suse-linux-enterprise-server-committed-use-discount-sles-cud-on-google-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)</a> — with savings of up to 79%.</li>
<li> There’s much fanfare at Google, as it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-blocked-largest-layer-7-ddos-attack-at-46-million-rps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocks the largest Layer 7 DDoS attack to date</a>. It didn’t last long though, because the attackers gave up — probably deciding there was no value in continuing.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team chats cloud region wars to establish the true victor. Plus: AWS Storage Day offers a blockhead badge, all the fun of the Microsoft Dev Box, and Google sends people back to sleep with its Cloud Monitoring snooze alert policy.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS Storage Day 2022 marks the fourth annual event streamed live on Twitch, with its File Cache service announcement and five new available learning badges.</li>
<li>Google now offers alert policy snoozing in Cloud Monitoring for maintenance or non-business hours.</li>
<li>Microsoft previews its Dev Box, a managed service enabling developers to create cloud workstations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I found it completely shocking that this didn&#8217;t exist in AWS — that you only had enable/disable — when first moving over there. So this is a fantastic feature for Google Monitoring. I love it.”</li>
<li> “This seems like one of those things I&#8217;d like, but half the fun of starting a new project is installing a new version of Python or something that completely hoses my local laptop. And I spend the next three or four days frantically trying to undo what I&#8217;ve done that breaks six other things.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: It’s Storage Day!</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS livestreamed its fourth annual <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-storage-day-2022/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Storage Day</a> on Twitch, and Ryan is rather excited about getting his hands on that blockhead badge for core storage competency. Plus, the new File Cache service promises to accelerate and simplify hybrid cloud workloads.</li>
<li> Continue to be blown away by the theory of HTTP/3 (and if you’re like Ryan, dread the day you have to troubleshoot it), as Amazon CloudFront <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-http-3-support-for-amazon-cloudfront/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now supports it</a>.</li>
<li> Now available in US regions (with a likely quick extension with increased adoption and understanding of the service): <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-private-5g-build-your-own-private-mobile-network/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Private 5G</a>.</li>
<li> Amazon and Splunk co-announce the release of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-co-announces-release-of-the-open-cybersecurity-schema-framework-ocsf-project/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) project</a> with a lot of partners… but (interestingly) no Elastic.</li>
<li> If you&#8217;ve been holding off on that move from Dockershim to the new launcher, now’s the time to do it before it’s too late: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/amazon-eks-distro-support-kubernetes-version-1-23/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro now support Kubernetes version 1.23</a>.</li>
<li> Apparently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/amazon-cognito-enables-native-support-aws-waf/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Cognito enables native support for AWS WAF</a>, but we’re not entirely sure what they&#8217;re enabling here — it feels like something they should have already been doing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Hitting the Snooze Button</h3>
<ul>
<li> Query Library offers new tools for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/increase-developer-productivity-with-query-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing developer productivity</a>. You should eventually be able to actually save your queries into a custom Query Library, but we’re ]]></description>

	<title>177: The Cloud Pod Hopes That Amazon Knows the Three Laws of iRobots</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team gets judicial on the Microsoft-Unity partnership. Plus: Amazon acquires iRobot, BigQuery boasts Zero-ETL for Bigtable data, and Serverless SQL for Azure Databricks is in public preview. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> iRobot signs an agreement with Amazon for its acquisition. To what end remains known to Amazon and Amazon alone.</li>
<li> Google offers a Zero-ETL approach for Bigtable data analytics using BigQuery.</li>
<li> Serverless SQL for Azure Databricks is now in public preview.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Almost all of Amazon&#8217;s big acquisitions have always been about something indirect. The Whole Foods acquisition was really about the logistics supply chain behind the scenes of moving that around — they kept the brand … and they have the same footprint for stores … but now they have a lot more infrastructure for AmazonFresh. And I suspect for iRobot it&#8217;s the same thing.”</li>
<li> “This is super handy for huge datasets where you want to track trends over a long time. It&#8217;s always really difficult and you always end up compromising somewhere — by not loading or querying your full dataset, because you can’t get it from A to B, or trying to run the query against two separate data sets and combining the results. So this is a nice thing to have for those users who have data across these multiple places.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: We, Robots</h3>
<ul>
<li> Those who hate working in Amazon warehouses might not have to have anything to complain about anymore, as <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-and-irobot-sign-agreement-amazon-acquire-irobot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon agrees to acquire iRobot</a>.</li>
<li> If you need to get up to speed with Graviton, you’ve now got <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/graviton-fast-start-a-new-program-to-help-move-your-workloads-to-aws-graviton/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Graviton Fast Start</a>, which helps move workloads over to AWS.</li>
<li> VMware’s interesting <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/08/04/aws-cloud-workload-protection/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cloud workload protection</a> feels like a continued diversification away from virtualization as your main revenue stream.</li>
<li> CloudWatch Evidently, Amazon&#8217;s second product to help with feature flagging, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/amazon-cloudwatch-evidently-customer-segments-feature-launches-experiments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">adds support for creating target customer segments for feature launches and experiments</a>. Neat!</li>
<li> In what seems like a cost-saving announcement, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/aws-lambda-tiered-pricing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lambda gets tiered pricing</a> (but most enterprise customers already have this pricing experience).</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: It’s A Big World Out There</h3>
<ul>
<li> You can now benefit from a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigtable-bigquery-federation-brings-hot--cold-data-closer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero-ETL approach for Bigtable data analytics using BigQuery</a>.</li>

	<title>176: The Cloud Pod Earnings Continue To Be Steady</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses why Ryan’s yelling all day (hint: he’s learning). Plus: Peter misses the all-important cloud earnings, AWS Skill Builder subscriptions are now available, and Google Eventarc connects SaaS platforms. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Earnings time is upon us once again, and it’s apparently doom and gloom all around as tears of loss are wiped away with $100 bills.</li>
<li> AWS makes its Skill Builder subscriptions available with more than 500 courses and four new learning experiences. (The Cloud Pod is now registering signups for a virtual proctor while you take the test.)</li>
<li>Google Eventarc for events enthusiasts unifies and integrates supported SaaS platforms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Teams is a huge focus. The last two years have been companies figuring out how to remote work for the first time ever. That&#8217;s not a sustainable thing —  those two years’ growth is all just pandemic.”</li>
<li> “I do like the way that they&#8217;re presenting a lot of this training. I don&#8217;t learn well in the classroom setting — I learn by doing, so any kind of hands-on labs or the jams which I&#8217;ve done in person at re:Invent are better for me to learn the internet intricacies of different services. So I love this.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Earnings, Damned Earnings, and Negative Analysts </h3>
<ul>
<li> First up for reported earnings is Microsoft, where <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2022-11658786211" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">no one’s really hurting</a>. (Wait until you see the other guys.)</li>
<li>Sadly, Google still hasn’t figured out how to make money on GCP. Ad revenue <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-report-2022-11658802135" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">is down</a>.</li>
<li> Amazon suffers slower demand amid <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-amzn-q2-earnings-report-2022-11658947016" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">another net loss</a>. Rivian takes a big hit, so if you were hoping to see it turn around, it hasn’t.</li>
<li> Of course, all of this bad news means <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/07/21/google-microsoft-reportedly-scale-back-hiring-efforts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google and Microsoft have scaled back hiring efforts</a>. Coupled with high inflation and bad interest rates, an economic bloodbath in the next 12 months looms.</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/oracle-axes-u-s-staff-part-of-plan-to-lay-off-thousands?rc=3t8xtd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oracle axes U.S. staff</a> as part of a plan to lay off thousands — mainly in marketing and customer experience. This could signal a step back from opening so many new data centers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Building Skills One Course at a Time</h3>
<ul>
<li> Handy new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-global-accelerator-internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6-support/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IPv6 support appears for AWS Global Accelerator</a>.</li>
<li> Already five years too late, CDK for Terraform is <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdk-for-terraform-now-generally-available" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now (finally) generally available</a>. </li>
<li> Amazon OpenSearch Service gets a trifecta of boosts in the form of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/08/amazon-opensearch-service-includes-log-application-analytics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">advanced log and application analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.]]></description>

<ul>
<li> AWS re:Inforce brings us Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Detective and IAM Identity Center releases, updates and name-changes for additional protection and headache.</li>
<li> Google Cloud adds a third Latin American data region to its collection — this time, in Mexico.</li>

<li> “This must always have been their plan. Amazon did not build that block Inspection Service just so that Orca could serve their own customers. They must have had an eye on the huge customer base of people using EBS Volumes to do this exact same thing. So it&#8217;s no surprise [as they’ve] had almost two years of sole ownership of the service to deliver this to customers. I&#8217;m not surprised at all to see an enhancement like this. And it&#8217;s awesome. Really.”</li>
<li> “Microsoft is in a lucky position, because the Windows ecosystem has been very services heavy for a long time. … They&#8217;ve got this unique position where they can deprecate … they can pivot to new APIs more quickly than AWS, who are stuck with so many customers [and it’s] very painful for them to deprecate … It’s lucky that [Microsoft] don&#8217;t have customers that would push back against this, because they&#8217;re used to constant change.”</li>

<h3>AWS: re:Inforcing Prime Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>#&#x20e3; There may well be some spin in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-prime-day-2022-aws-for-the-win/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Barr’s latest brag</a> on behalf of Amazon for its Prime Day 2022. Impressive numbers nonetheless!</li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-amazon-guardduty-malware-detection-for-amazon-ebs-volumes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New malware detection for EBS Volumes</a> with GuardDuty is the first of three announcements hot out of AWS re:Inforce — very similar to Orca Security malware snapshot and restore functions.</li>

There’s nothing not to like here, and it shows exactly why we use managed services.</li>
<li> Finally, the terribly named AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/scale-your-workforce-access-management-with-aws-iam-identity-center-previously-known-as-aws-sso/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IAM Identity Center</a> — which you may remember was previously called AWS SSO — promises to scale your workforce access management.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses facial recognition avoidance tactics. Plus: Waving farewell to CentOS 7 with the rise of Rocky Linux, Amazon traverses the new Cloudscape, and the U.K. heatwave spells disaster for Oracle and Google data centers.</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> As CentOS is put out to pasture, say hello to Rocky Linux, named in honor of CentOS late co-founder Rocky McGaugh.</li>
<li> Cloudscape Design System is the latest AWS open source wonder for web application building.</li>

</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “It answers the question of who we shout at if there&#8217;s a bug at zero day and the community doesn’t get around to fixing it. Now we can shout at Google.”</li>
<li> “It&#8217;s probably a sign of further issues to come unless they do some productive work. Because it&#8217;s one thing to … build a data center in Utah [where] it gets up to 45 degrees C and the sun&#8217;s heating the air under some land. And that&#8217;s a completely different situation than heating up Europe, which is … much less expected to have those kinds of temperatures so far north. … So it&#8217;s going to be time to invest in HVAC business.”</li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Future forward Google prepares for a post-quantum world, while most corporations won’t catch up for a long time.</li>
<li> Amazon EC2 M1 Mac instances are now generally available (so the hidden Mac Mini under that developer’s desk can finally be replaced).</li>
<li> Master of marketing Oracle introduces sovereign cloud regions for the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p> “Quantum computing has been taken very seriously from a security perspective. Conservative estimates [are] 10 to 20 years before we have quantum computers large enough and reliable enough to run short algorithms to factor these large primes. But we&#8217;re starting &#8230; It’s going to take a long time for businesses to actually catch on and realize and modernize and adopt this before the bad things start to happen. If they ever do.”</p>
<p> “The big issue is from a federal government perspective: In a world where quantum computing can actually go through those primes fast enough and decrypt all this data … it&#8217;s a huge national security risk [and] a huge problem for the world. … Does it follow into the corporate world as quickly? No. Will it become a big issue when it happens? Hell yeah. There&#8217;ll be a Y2K-level disaster that we&#8217;ll have to be dealing with.”</p>

<h3>AWS: New York, New York</h3>
<ul>
<li> EC2 M1 Mac instances are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m1-mac-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a>. Thanks to Apple’s licensing agreement, they have to be turned on for 24 hours minimum.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses data sovereignty for future space-customers. Plus: There’s a global cloud shortage, Google announces Apigee advanced API security, and GKE Autopilot gets new networking features.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Microsoft is the latest victim in a global cloud shortage, spinning it as a temporary issue fueled by surging Teams demand and rapid Azure growth.</li>
<li> Google announces Apigee Advanced API Security in a bid to defend against increased attacks and traffic volumes.</li>
<li> GKE Autopilot gets new network features in the form of IP masquerading and eBPF, now generally available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “The supply chain has been huge on a lot of people. You don&#8217;t hear so much from Amazon, and I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s related to the commerce site Amazon.com and the overprovisioning they did … If AWS went the same route and has a bunch of stock, cluster manufacturing their own chips, maybe they have a little bit more control. But everyone else is screwed.”</li>
<li> “In the article, it just says what you can do to detect bots. But some bots are the use case [you’re] selling to the world. &#8230; On the surface, it sounds logical, but there are some ‘gotchas’ that you need to be careful of if you&#8217;re doing B2B or doing things that look bot-ish.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: All the Joy of the Crypto Crash</h3>
<ul>
<li> Apparently the tech talent crunch (not because we suck at running Kafka) is to blame for <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/07/04/report-68-of-orgs-plan-to-rely-more-on-aws-managed-services-in-the-next-12-months/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a 68% reliance on AWS managed services</a>. Come on, VentureBeat, you can do better than this! </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Peter finally returns with some beer-based bets about Amazon extending its TLS deadline. Plus: Terraform drift detection for managing infrastructure, chilling tales of Amazon’s CodeWhisperer ML advances, and Anthos on-premise options finally arrive for your platform of choice. Plus the cloud talks about AWS SNOWCONES in SPACE!!!!!!</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Terraform Cloud finally adds drift detection to help manage infrastructure, now generally available after its 2020 preview.</li>
<li> Amazon’s crazy “ML-powered coding companion,” CodeWhisperer, is here for our jobs.</li>
<li> Google expands its Distributed Cloud platform with Anthos on-premises options. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s taken so long. Because I mean, the reality is if you&#8217;re in a plan, and the plan doesn&#8217;t require any changes, then there&#8217;s been no drift. So what was the obstacle in delivering this as a feature sooner?”</li>
<li> “Not only they&#8217;re training their own machine learning models, but they&#8217;re also generating code. Not concerned at all.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Drifting in the Right Direction</h3>
<ul>
<li> While everyone’s been a little afraid to pull the trigger, HashiCorp <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-cloud-adds-drift-detection-for-infrastructure-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announced drift detection in Terraform cloud</a>, which is in a public beta.

</ul>
<h3>AWS: Whispering Sweet Somethings to the Machine</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-now-supports-synthetic-data-generation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SageMaker Ground Truth now supports synthetic data generation</a>, promising to reduce time and training costs for model operations. Getting enough data to actually train a model could be hard… (fake it til you make it?)</li>
<li> Your new “ML-powered coding companion” <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-in-preview-amazon-codewhisperer-ml-powered-coding-companion/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CodeWhisperer</a> now writes code for you. We’ve joked about it before, but Alexa really is one step away from upskilling to coding.</li>
<li> Peter’s betting two beers at his local pub on Amazon extending the deadline on this one: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/tls-1-2-required-for-aws-endpoints/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TLS 1.2 is to become the minimum TLS protocol level for all AWS API endpoints</a>. There’s currently just under a year to get yourself sorted. Good luck!</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses Jonathan’s penance for his failures. Plus: Microsoft makes moves on non-competes, NDAs, salary disclosures, and a civil rights audit; AWS modernizes mainframe applications for cloud deployment; and AWS CEO Adam Selipsky chooses to be intentionally paranoid.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> The Balmer era is officially dead: Microsoft curbs non-competes, drops NDAs from worker settlements, disclose salary ranges, and even launches a civil rights audit. </li>
<li> AWS launches their new modernization service for mainframe applications, now deployable in fully managed AWS runtime environments.</li>
<li> AWS CEO Adam Selipsky “choose[s] to be intentionally paranoid,” as he leads the company through turbulence. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “We&#8217;ve talked about how garbage those [noncompetes] are, the problems they&#8217;ve had with them, executives leaving, Amazon going to Microsoft, then getting sued and all the mess of that. So I&#8217;m super glad they&#8217;re finally starting to see a tide swell change in technology where that&#8217;s no longer a thing.”</li>
<li> “I always felt like Amazon was going to just create a mainframe as a service offering — buy a bunch of IBM mainframes that they sell out to you — because that&#8217;s been a model of mainframe for a long time: CPU slicing, rentals and that kind of thing. But it seems like now they&#8217;re going to go down this other path where the answer is [that] you convert to a more modern architecture, which is interesting.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: It’s a New Era</h3>
<ul>
<li>  The times they are a-changin’, as <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2022/microsoft-to-end-non-competes-for-all-but-senior-execs-drop-ndas-from-employee-settlements-disclose-salary-ranges-launch-civil-rights-audit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft revises its position on non-competes, NDAs, and salary range disclosure</a>, while launching a civil rights audit. Take that, Amazon!</li>
<li> Target CIO Mike McNamara <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/target-cio-mike-mcnamara-multicloud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jumps away from AWS</a> with a scaled move toward multicloud architecture. Target allegedly has 4,000 engineers, which seems like a lot.</li>
<li> Archera vents via Venturebeat about the unmanageability of cloud costs, calling for <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/06/11/cloud-costs-are-unmanageable-its-time-we-standardize-billing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">standardized billing</a>. While it might be helpful and even valuable, this seems a road too far traveled.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Modernized Mainframes and Intentional Paranoia</h3>
<ul>
<li> You can now take advantage of AWS’ new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/modernize-your-mainframe-applications-deploy-them-in-the-cloud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modernization service for mainframe applications</a>, deployable in fully managed AWS runtime environments.</li>
<li> There are some <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-mgn-update-configure-dr-convert-centos-linux-to-rocky-linux-and-convert-suse-linux-subscription/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">nice enhancements for MGN</a>, including DR configuration and Linux to Rocky Linux and SUSE Linux Subscription conversions.</li>
<li> AWS CEO Adam Selipsky admits, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/i-choose-to-be-intentionally-paranoid-adam-selipsky-navigates-aws-into-a-cloudy-future?rc=3t8xtd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“I choose to be intentionally paranoid,”</a> as he leads the compan]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, half the team whizzes through the news in record time. Plus: AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery, Google Distributed Cloud adds AI, ML and Database Solutions, and there’s another win for NetApp with Azure VMware Solution.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery now supports up to 300 staging and target accounts, which seems like a small number for some enterprises with thousands.</li>
<li>With the power of Anthos, Google Distributed Cloud adds AI, ML and Database Solutions — continuing the trend of service monetization regardless of host location.</li>
<li> Another win for NetApp, the home of choice for Azure VMware solutions optimization. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “If you&#8217;re really doing auto scaling [and] traditional cloud native, you don&#8217;t use the service because you’ve already built it into your app. So this is for legacy IT operations like SAP, Oracle, and others. Three hundred or 3,000 covers small and medium business, but large enterprise has way more than that.”</li>
<li> “When Anthos first was announced, and Outpost for AWS, we talked about how likely it was that more and more cloud-native services were going to be made available anywhere, on any cloud, in any data center. It&#8217;s definitely a pattern of monetizing the services regardless of where they&#8217;re hosted.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Bouncing Back From Disaster</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-emr-serverless-now-generally-available-run-big-data-applications-without-managing-servers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EMR Serverless is now generally available</a>, a cool feature running big data applications (and Outpost too). But it’s interesting that it’s been branded “serverless” when it’s clearly a managed service.</li>
<li> Elastic Disaster Recovery <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/aws-elastic-disaster-recovery-multiple-staging-target-accounts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now supports 300 staging and target accounts</a>, but we can’t help wondering how this helps the largest enterprises.</li>
<li> Step Functions <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/aws-step-functions-interactive-workshop-building-deploying-application-workflows/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">launches a workflow-based interactive application workshop</a>, and it looks like a golden age for developer experience is close at hand.</li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/amazon-route-53-ip-based-routing-dns-queries/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Route 53 announces IP-based routing for DNS queries</a>, which is going to make things complicated. So preoccupied with whether or not they could integrate, they didn&#8217;t stop to think if they should.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Complexity on Top of Complexity</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google Chronicle offers <a href="https://chronicle.security/blog/posts/powering-security-operations-with-context-aware-detections-alert-prioritization-and-risk-scoring/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">context-aware detections, alert prioritization and risk scoring</a> for  its Security Operations. But wouldn&#8217;t you want to protect everybody from everything?</li>
<li> A boon for customer choice and flexibility: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-distributed-cloud-adds-ai-ml-and-database-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Distributed Cloud adds AI, ML and database solutions</a>. On prem, running Kubernetes and Anthos? Justin loves this.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses the new Madrid region’s midday siesta shutdown. Plus: Broadcom acquires VMWare for $61 billion, Azure gets paradigmatic with 5G, and you can now take the 2022 Google-DORA DevOps survey.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Broadcom acquires VMWare for $61 billion, in one of the largest-ever acquisitions.</li>
<li> Google Cloud and DORA team up to bring us the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Survey.</li>
<li> Azure calls 5G a “paradigm,” but is it just hype?</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “This is an interesting reverse on the large cloud providers getting into the silicon business, which makes sense to me — that they want to control their supply chain and optimize. … Is Broadcom going to start becoming like a cloud provider? That&#8217;s interesting. I wouldn&#8217;t suspect that.”</li>
<li> “What [is Azure] trying to do? Are they trying to sell us on [5G]? Are they trying to change the way we develop? Because we&#8217;re just going to waste our time developing stuff that requires some of these things, and then the infrastructure is not going to be there to support it.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Diversifying the Portfolio</h3>
<ul>
<li> In one of the largest acquisitions ever (just shy of Dell’s EMC takeover at $67 billion and Microsoft’s Blizzard acquisition at $69 billion), <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/26/broadcom-to-acquire-vmware-for-61b/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Broadcom acquires VMware for $61 billion</a>. This could have <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/27/what-broadcoms-acquisition-of-vmware-means-for-the-enterprise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">big implications for enterprise</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Need for Speed</h3>
<ul>
<li> If you need a lot of disk space to log transactions, you’re in luck: Amazon EC2 M6id and C6id instances <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-m6id-and-c6id-instances-with-up-to-7-6-tb-local-nvme-storage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">buff up their storage</a> by up to 7.6TB.</li>
<li> Ryan’s usually doing whatever he can to avoid this, but if you need Elastic Volumes and Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) support for io2 Block Express, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/05/amazon-ebs-elastic-volumes-snapshot-restore-fsr-io2-block-express/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">you’ve now got it</a>.                                   </li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: the State of DevOps in 2022</h3>
<ul>
<li> Why do IT leaders choose Google Cloud certification for their teams? In case you were wondering, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/value-of-google-cloud-certifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s a puff piece with the answer</a>.</li>
<li> If you need to change streams with Cloud Spanner, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/spanner/change-streams-for-cloud-spanner-now-generally-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can now do so</a>. A cool feature, but it does need to be by email (there’s no homing pigeon option… yet).</li>
<li> If you want to learn a whole bunch of irrelevant HPC jargon, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/new-google-cloud-hpc-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this is the blog post for you</a>.</li>

<li> Microsoft Build comes out of nowhere to deliver awesome, scary AI-driven tools with much mention of metaverse (yuck).</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “This feature isn&#8217;t developed for you because you&#8217;re curious about the cost. This is developed specifically for the people who are not curious about the cost. It&#8217;s a big red number. When they&#8217;re doing the deployment, it’s like, oh, I should probably not do that.”</li>
<li> “I cannot wait for the robot overlords to completely school me at code. This is gonna be hilarious… and frightening.”</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team struggles with scheduling to get everyone in the same room for just one week. Plus, Microsoft increases pay for talent retention while changing licensing for European Cloud Providers, Google Cloud introduces AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, and AWS announces EC2 support for NitroTPM.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Big changes are afoot with Microsoft on both pay and European licensing fronts.</li>
<li> A very busy Google finds time to release AlloyDB for PostgreSQL. </li>
<li> NitroTPM gets Amazon EC2 support. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I hope that it&#8217;s the exact opposite of TK and Google Cloud — that they’re really focused on the values and the culture and providing meaningful work. Especially during the last year in the pandemic, a lot of people have realized there&#8217;s a lot of different priorities; that money is good — it doesn&#8217;t buy happiness, but it buys a lot of things that can make me happy — but it&#8217;s getting that fulfillment, and enrichment is also super important. Not just a slog.”</li>
<li> “The problem is they&#8217;re not building power plants fast enough to support all of the power demand they have in this country. So there&#8217;s a possibility that these cloud providers may get pushback on building data centers in the region, which can have a huge detrimental impact. So keep an eye on that.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Some Dynamite Announcements</h3>

<li> Open source supply chain security gets a nice big <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-investing-an-additional-10-million-in-open-source-supply-chain-security/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$10 million investment from AWS</a>.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Peter’s been suspended without pay for two weeks for not filing his vacation requests in triplicate. Plus it’s earnings season once again, there’s a major Google and SWIFT collaboration afoot, and MSK Serverless is now generally available, making Kafka management fairly hassle-free.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Earnings season is upon us once again, with billions earned and lost. Who are the winners? </li>
<li> MSK Serverless is now generally available as a boon for Kafka management.</li>
<li> Google and SWIFT uproot the financial world in announcing a huge cloud-based collaboration. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “It&#8217;s hard to call a 32% increase for Azure earnings a slowdown, but it is definitely slower than what they saw in 2021 and the boom of the pandemic. But the overall trend is everyone&#8217;s gonna keep adopting cloud hyperscalers to host their infrastructure.”</li>
<li> “The important thing about this is that it&#8217;s signaling a change in compliance controls; all these financial organizations with very traditionally physical hardware in Iraq in the data center [had] no way to move to the cloud. So whether it&#8217;s through advocacy or proof of process, being able to virtualize all these things is going to be huge and will open up a massive market for new customers.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Earnings Are In, and It’s Looking&#8230; Good?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Imagine earning $116.4 billion and then <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-first-quarter-results-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">still losing money</a>. But fear not after such a rough quarter, Amazon: AWS revenue is here to save the day at 37%.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=d9e9d97" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google</a> revenue increased slightly below expectations, and GCP is still losing money — but $43 million less than last year.</li>
<li> Finally, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2022-Q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Azure to thank</a> for its 32% growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: A Truly Kafkaesque Affair</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-msk-serverless-now-generally-available-no-more-capacity-planning-for-your-managed-kafka-clusters/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MSK Serverless is now generally available</a>, offering a reduction in the overhead of managing Kafka.</li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-storage-optimized-amazon-ec2-instances-i4i-powered-by-intel-xeon-scalable-ice-lake-processors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 instances</a> get some storage-optimizing icy processing power. (You just know there&#8217;s still a whole team of DBAs that doesn&#8217;t think this is good enough.)</li>
<li> Last on the AWS front: There are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-management-features-ec2-key-pairs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new management features for EC2 key pairs</a>. We’re ecstatic!</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Last Chance to Register for the Google Cloud Security Summit</h3>
<ul>
<li> GCP offers some <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-april-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CISO perspectives</a> on security updates, as well as a reminder to register for the upcoming summit.</li>

	<title>165: The Cloud Pod Angry That Amazon Describes Step Functions as Low Code</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses wholesome local Oakland toast for breakfast. Plus: Hybrid infrastructure is unsustainable, the AWS Proton template library expands, and Amazon angers the team by describing Step Functions as “low-code.”</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Against the trend of popular opinion, it turns out that hybrid infrastructure is a bad idea in the long term, with a few significant drawbacks.</li>
<li> The AWS Proton template library just got bigger, so now people can find something else to complain about.</li>
<li> Amazon annoyingly describes Step Functions as low-code, which is definitely not true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Proton was only developed as an answer for, how should we deploy onto Amazon? It&#8217;s setting yourself up just so someone can armchair-quarterback and poke holes in it. Now they&#8217;re saying, well, how would you do this? [Answer:] You have the templates. And then they&#8217;re gonna be like, the templates are cool, except it doesn&#8217;t meet my pretty edge case, so they&#8217;ll complain about that. We&#8217;ll see templates for the templates next.”</li>
<li> “I just love the assumption that you could low-code a solution with Step Functions, just because I&#8217;ve created many a step function and state machine flow. And all it is is coding and then figuring out why the code isn&#8217;t doing what I want — because I&#8217;m not passing things correctly between the different functions. The ability for someone who can&#8217;t write code to be able to to accomplish anything is a little far fetched.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Don’t Plan on Hybrid for Long&#8230;</h3>
<ul>
<li> In the cloud court of public opinion, dissent is infrequent. Yet <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/07/the-future-of-on-prem-and-the-cloud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here’s Michael Bathon of Rimini Street</a> claiming that hybrid is actually bad in the long-term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: What Is Low-Code, Anyway?</h3>
<ul>
<li> The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-new-templates-to-the-aws-proton-template-library/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Proton template library expands</a> — as does people’s list of things to complain about.</li>
<li> Amazon very irritatingly calls Step Functions low-code, with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/05/announcing-new-workflow-observability-features-aws-step-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new workflow observability features</a>.</li>
<li> Can the annoying customer with the single use case please stand up? <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/05/amazon-rds-postgresql-cascaded-read-replicas-30x-capacity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL now supports a lot more read replicas</a>. Driven by the business side, perhaps?</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Something’s Got To Give With BigQuery</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/cloud-tpu-vms-are-generally-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud TPU VMs are now generally available</a>, with faster speeds and lower costs for training.</li>
<li> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-bi-engine-generally-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigQuery BI Engine now supports more tools and custom applications</a>. All we heard is that the analysts want to learn BigQuery, so they made it work for them.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team rediscovers who Ryan is after an eternity (a secret agent). Plus AWS Fargate now delivers faster scaling of applications; new features for Oracle Support Rewards; and Google Cloud Optimization AI: Cloud Fleet Routing API from GCP.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Witness the magic of AWS Fargate scaling of applications — harder, faster, better, stronger.</li>
<li> Ooooh! Unveiling brand new shiny features for Oracle Support Rewards.</li>
<li> Better planning with more routes: GCP unleashes Optimization AI, API for Cloud Fleet Routing (CFR). </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Because of that Fargate-specific limitation, [with] the first three services you&#8217;re concurrently updating, you&#8217;ll actually get a much faster rate through ECS test launches, but that fourth service will be slower. At that point, if the math works out where you&#8217;re better off hosting it on EC2 … it&#8217;s a lot more complex. I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of teams on trying to get ECS services to scale faster, and usually I look at them a little skeptically — do you really need this fast?”</li>
<li> “In terms of looking at lists of interview questions from Google algorithm questions and the traveling salesman problem and optimizing journeys through multiple locations, multiple cities, everything else, it&#8217;s a really hard problem. It only gets exponentially more difficult. And then the more efficient you are with that, the more it costs the environment, the more it costs in time or it costs money. So yeah, it&#8217;s actually a worthy problem to solve.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Microsoft Feels the Heat</h3>
<ul>
<li> We’re feeling the pain of Microsoft’s licensing, as its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/350e7fed-cd52-4a0a-9902-5f2d9ebc3fe7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tactics to win the cloud battle lead to new antitrust scrutiny</a>.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team establishes that Justin may be immune to COVID. Plus all the latest from the AWS Summit, Azure Red Button team up on DDOS defense, and engines are revving in the great VMware showdown. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> The AWS San Francisco Summit kicks off with a ton of new generally available stuff, but not-so-impressive attendance (looking at you, COVID).</li>
<li> Microsoft and Red Button buddy up on DDOS defense testing initiative.</li>
<li> AWS, Google and Oracle rev their engines for the VMware top spot. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Really shows you the power of partnership … There’s finally some easy button for testing these things. Because you always dream: Maybe I could create my own DDoS situation, which seemingly I do occasionally by accident, but intentionally would be nice this time.”</li>
<li> “I don&#8217;t necessarily trust their math, but assuming that it’s reasonably correct, it seems like a good market for Oracle to go after if you&#8217;re gonna try to compete with those three platforms — I don&#8217;t see a ton of people moving straight to the cloud on VMware. But that&#8217;s a pretty compelling argument and potentially a way of getting VMware customers to the cloud quicker: let&#8217;s just do it now if we don&#8217;t have to get off of VMware.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Great Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li> Gartner anticipates <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/04/20/report-public-cloud-spending-expected-to-grow-20-4-in-2022/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">big growth (20.4%) in public cloud spending</a> for 2022!</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Everything Generally Available</h3>
<ul>
<li> Finally, you can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/iam-access-resource-organization/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">use IAM to control access to a resource based on the account, OU or organization that contains the resource</a> — just how it used to be, and makes a whole lot more sense.</li>

	<title>TCP Talks: The Service Not the Software: Anthony Lye on Evolution and Revolution</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Anthony Lye, Executive Vice President and General Manager of NetApp’s Public Cloud Services Business Unit. An industry veteran for over 25 years, Anthony has been at the forefront of cloud innovation for over half this time.</p>
<p>Anthony shares his insight on the importance of embracing disruption in the tech industry. He discusses how NetApp seized the right opportunities, got lucky, and came to dominate the Cloud space — even while younger app developers may have no idea what it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t comprehend — nor should they — the complexities of infrastructure,” Anthony explains. “And I really love the fact that we&#8217;ve been able to democratize ONTAP, because it&#8217;s cool, but you’ve got to be really smart to get the best out of it. And so we just decided we would be the smart ones.”</p>
<p>What’s really behind innovation in tech? “The context is where you are. And people like to think that the world operates through evolution. And sometimes it&#8217;s revolution –- sometimes, you have to do something radically different.”</p>
<p>Anthony also discusses cloud computing trends, the importance of customer focus, what NetApp does differently, and the multi-cloud.</p>
<h2>Featured Guest</h2>
<p> Name: Anthony Lye</p>
<p> What he does: Anthony is Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Public Cloud Services business for <a href="https://www.netapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NetApp</a></p>
<p> Key quote: “You’ve got to put the customer in the middle of your business. And you’ve got to go where they want you to go. If you don&#8217;t, your hold may last a while, but it won&#8217;t last. And I still can&#8217;t believe that what we did we got away with, and we&#8217;ve gotten so much time to build so aggressively. It&#8217;s great.” </p>
<p> Where to find him: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonylye" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li> There are two halves of the cloud space: the IT half and the app half. IT people see huge opportunities in extending data centers. App people want to and can build and run their own stacks, and Anthony took advantage of this. “They don&#8217;t have to wait for the IT people,” Anthony says. “And I wanted to build something for them — I didn&#8217;t want to just hang out on the IT side. I went and asked a whole bunch of application people: what do you need?”</li>
<li> NetApp spies huge business growth potential on the horizon with recurring revenues. “Recurring revenues are the best kinds of revenues you can get,” Anthony clarifies. But people don’t always consider this. “Because they&#8217;re different, they sort of ignore them — they don&#8217;t like them. And before they know it, they&#8217;re years behind and caught. And passed as if they&#8217;re standing still.” </li>
<li> The customer is and always should be focused on as front and center of any business. For NetApp, the software and implementation are the same, but the unique integrations are what makes the service stand out. With SaaS, it’s now the second “S” — the service — that matters most. “The rule of SaaS is the other Henry Ford thing: you can have it in any color you want, as long as it&#8217;s black,” Anthony says. “We&#8217;re going to run it for you as a service, and you&#8217;re going to love it”, NetApp tells customers, increasing developer productivity and providing a much higher release cadence.</li>
</ul>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week and with half the team gone fishin’, Justin and Peter hash it out short and sweet. Plus Google Cloud SQL Insights, Atlassian suffers an outage, and AWS finally offers accessible Lambda Function URLs.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Atlassian suffers an outage, sparking fears of data loss.</li>
<li> AWS offers some very welcome accessibility for Lambda Functions.</li>
<li> Google announces Cloud SQL Insights for MySQL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “When Lambda first came out, before I even used it, this is how I thought it would work … then it didn&#8217;t. So it&#8217;s cool that it&#8217;s now available. I&#8217;m surprised it wasn&#8217;t the default — the starting point — before getting more complex, like API gateways.”</li>
<li> “It&#8217;s almost required: These tools are so important when it&#8217;s a managed service and you can&#8217;t get under the covers yourself. So it&#8217;s cool, for sure. Especially when you get into how these things work with your cloud and how they interact with each other, it becomes even more important.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Atlassian Made a DevOops</h3>
<ul>
<li> While only 0.25% of their customer base was affected, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/engineering/april-2022-outage-update" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Atlassian’s outage</a> is not a good look. The company <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/08/atlassian_service_issues_linger_leaving/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">continues to be haunted</a> by it, with data loss fears.</li>
<li> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/04/11/cloud-services-provider-sungard-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sungard is doomed.</a> A Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing confines them to history’s unmarked grave of discarded cloud victims. </li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Lambda Finally Does What It Was Always Meant To</h3>
<ul>
<li> Accessible <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-lambda-function-urls-built-in-https-endpoints-for-single-function-microservices/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lambda Function URLs</a> are now yours — something that would’ve been nice when it first came out.</li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-security-hub-controls-new-integration-partner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Security Hub launches five controls and one new integration partner</a>, in a move that seems to open the door to start using it for all sorts of non-security checks. </li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/amazon-commands-windows-container-aws-fargate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon ECS now allows you to run commands in a Windows container running on AWS Fargate</a>. Peter doesn’t want to do this at all, but maybe someone does.</li>
<li> Something you always thought would have been there but didn’t know actually existed: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/amazon-rds-sql-server-sql-agent-job-replication/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon RDS for SQL Server now supports SQL Server Agent job replication</a>.</li>
<li> Ooooooh: PrivateLink, Transit Gateway and Client VPN services all get a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-data-transfer-price-reduction-privatelink-transit-gateway-client-vpn-services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data transfer price reduction</a> — a good first step!</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Google Biglake takes the feature of the week with the ability to federate data from multiple data lakes. On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses the most expensive way to run a VM (Oracle wins). Plus some exciting developments, an AWS OpenSearch 1.2 update with several new features, and Azure’s having a party, so bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> The Cloud Pod goes fishing on Google BigLake with a new tackle box and a whole lot of data.</li>
<li> AWS opens up the market with its OpenSearch 1.2 update boasting several new features and which could attract more customers.</li>
<li> Azure implements a fancy new bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Are they saving BigOcean for the next layer of unification above when we need to aggregate multiple BigLakes?”</li>
<li> “It is good to be able to do it, and I still pity the poor companies who need to migrate IP addresses and anchor their IPs to a provider in order to get their DVR functionality. So this now makes that possible, however bad a pattern that is in the cloud.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Decisions, Decisions</h3>

<li> VentureBeat discusses <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/04/05/how-to-choose-the-right-aws-region-for-your-business/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">how to choose the right AWS region for your business</a>, but they seem to be missing a few considerations (sovereignty, anyone?). Also, picking a region isn’t a great idea for a business (like an e-commerce site) that needs to be multiregional to survive if things go sideways.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Opening up the Search Nice and Wide </h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-now-supports-kubernetes-1-22/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EKS now supports Kubernetes 1.22</a> — maybe AWS bribed the Kubernetes governance board because they were tired of trying to keep up with Kubernetes’ quarterly patch releases.</li>
<li> Good news for console users who no longer have to click through five separate pages of configurations, with the new and improved <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/amazon-ec2-launch-experience-console/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 console launch experience</a>.</li>
<li> Cue applause track: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-organizations-central-account-closure-lifecycle-management/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Organizations now provides central AWS account closure</a>. We’ve been waiting for this for years.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Ryan is in the doghouse and he’s been suspended (with full pay). Plus, we’re comfortably numb with AWS Cloud NGFW, GCP suspends hosts for big savings, and Azure is once again shutting the Front Door on us. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>  AWS Cloud NGFW cost calculations leaves us comfortably numb.  </li>
<li> GCP boasts big savings by temporarily suspending unneeded hosts.</li>
<li> Azure is once again shutting the Front Door with a new, modern cloud service. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I&#8217;m ready to make my [AWS] re:Invent next year&#8217;s first prediction, which will be an AmazonBasics version of that for 1/10th of the cost.”</li>
<li> “I’m very curious to actually see the comparison … in cost because, assuming performance is relatively similar, cost is what this always comes down to.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Pay Less, More Often!</h3>
<ul>
<li> Helping you bleed cash by the hour instead of writing one big annual check, AWS presents <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cloud-ngfw-for-aws/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the new Cloud NGFW</a>. Ouch.</li>
<li> Knock yourself out with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-now-supports-up-to-10-gb-ephemeral-storage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">up to 10 GB ephemeral storage</a> supported with AWS Lambda. It’s cheap (at $0.0000000309 for every GB-second), but they’re not giving it to you — they’re selling it to you.</li>
<li> We’re slightly concerned about the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-proton-terraform-open-source/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Proton support for Terraform Open Source</a> and its effects on potential future innovation.</li>
<li> Amazon hops on Google’s gamification bandwagon with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/amazon-gamesparks-preview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon GameSparks now in preview</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: GCP Equalizes With a Quiet Week</h3>
<ul>
<li> Nice job, Google: a feature with an edge over other cloud providers that offers big savings by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/save-by-suspending-vms-on-google-compute-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily suspending unneeded Compute Engine VMs</a>. Awesome!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Azure: It All Comes Down to Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li> Azure shutting the front door on us once again with the now generally available <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/generally-available-the-new-azure-front-door-a-modern-cloud-cdn-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern cloud CDN service, Azure Front Door</a>. This probably gives them a competitive advantage over AWS for at least a week or two.</li>
<li> In a surprising turn of events, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-india-hyderabad-data-center-region-intent/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft announces its intent to establish an India datacenter region in Hyderabad</a>. As that’s where most of their employees are, how was there not one there already?</li>
<li> It’s like UPnP for cloud, so do not use lightly: Azure Load Balancer now allows you to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/manage-port-forwarding-for-backend-pool-with-azure-load-balancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage port forwarding for a backend pool</a>. We seriously recommend discussing this with your security team in advance.</li>
</ul>
TCP Lightning Round
<p> Peter finally levels up, making the scores: Justin (4), Ryan (1), Jonathan (1), Peter (1).</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On The Cloud Pod this week, it’s a brave new world for Ryan, who learns all kinds of things. Plus the Okta breach leads to customer outrage over not telling them for months, AWS announces its new Billing Conductor, and Google expands Contact Center AI for a reimagined customer experience. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Okta is in big trouble with furious customers after it fails to disclose a security breach… for months. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> AWS announces the brand new and very welcome AWS Billing Conductor to much fanfare and great rejoicing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Google expands end-to-end with Contact Center AI for a touted “reimagining” of the customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> “The breach is bad enough, but then the handling of the communications of it is really what seals the deal and where you really do all the damage. It&#8217;s one thing if someone attacks you and gets in through something unintended … that&#8217;s not going to shake my confidence in using a company. But someone who&#8217;s hiding it, someone who&#8217;s clearly dancing around it, makes me think that they&#8217;re not well organized.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> “Google is notoriously bad for customer support … and it&#8217;s very difficult to be a satisfied customer of Google when you have to deal with their support channels. So anything they can do for anybody to make the customer experience less frustrating is good. Let&#8217;s hope that this doesn&#8217;t just turn into another agent, please situation where all you want to do is break out of the system and just speak to a real person who can apply some logic.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Okta Breach Shenanigans</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Change your credentials immediately. Customers are raging at Okta, which manages 100 million logins but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/03/22/fury-as-okta-the-company-that-manages-100-million-logins-fails-to-tell-customers-about-breach-for-months/?sh=583289fe8734" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">failed to disclose a security breach for months</a>. Just who is running things over there?</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Money Money Money</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Donald Trump’s golf courses are going to be very unhappy to learn that <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/03/17/aws-invest-2-3b-uk-data-centers-next-two-years/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS is investing $2.3 billion in UK data centers over the next two years</a>, taking advantage of the Moray West Wind Farm off the coast of Scotland — creating 1000 jobs and injecting £500,000 into the Scottish economy.</li>
<li> Billing and accounting departments across the land rejoice as AWS announces its very welcome and much improved <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-announces-aws-billing-conductor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Billing Conductor</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Sharing is caring: AWS Lambda console now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-lambda-console-test-events/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supports the option to share test events between developers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: ReAImagining Customer Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> “Agent, please.” Let’s hope Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-announces-new-cloud-contact-center-ai-platform" target="_blank" r]]></description>

	<title>157: The Cloud Pod Goes on a Quest…. An AWS Cloud Quest</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team discusses Peter’s concept of fun. Plus digital adventures with AWS Cloud Quest game, much-wanted Google price increases, and a labyrinthine run-through of the details of Azure Health Data Services.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS gamifies cloud training with the release of Cloud Quest, along with two new initiatives in a bid to build foundational cloud skills for younger people.</li>
<li> Google announces price changes while framing it as “choice”: Some services will decrease in price while others will increase.</li>
<li> Microsoft launches Azure Health Data Services, the details of which turn out to be super fun trying to get your head around.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “If you&#8217;ve ever wanted the job of living in a 3D world where a construction worker runs up to you and tells you that the server running in this weather app is failing and helping them figure this out, this game is for you. And you can earn gems and build and it feels very much like Roblox…. I give it an A for effort and an F for execution.”</li>
<li> “One of the arguments that people have made against the cloud forever is that once you&#8217;re locked in, they&#8217;re gonna jack the rates up, and then you&#8217;re screwed because you&#8217;re stuck there. It&#8217;s that exact thing. This is now giving credence to those naysayers who traditionally will say that&#8217;s not really true. … Now we have an exact use-case: Google did it. So what’s to stop Azure and AWS from doing it?”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Slay the Dragon and Rescue the Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li> New bigger and badder <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-x2idn-and-x2iedn-instances-for-memory-intensive-workloads-with-higher-network-bandwidth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC2 X2idn and X2iedn Instances</a> for you to throw your money away on are now here — supporting memory-intensive workloads with higher network bandwidth.</li>
<li> If you’re excited about Pi Day, Jeff Barr helps celebrate with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-pi-day-2022/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bragging blog post</a> on the number of objects Amazon S3 now boasts (with some fun galaxial anecdotes to boot).</li>
<li> A feature we can finally appreciate: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/amazon-ecs-service-api-updating-elastic-load-balancers-service-registries-tag-propagation-ecs-managed-tags/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon ECS Update Service API now supports updating Elastic Load Balancers, Service Registries, Tag Propagation, and ECS Managed Tags</a>.</li>
<li> And moving onto an AWS feature we don&#8217;t care about, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/amazon-ecs-on-premises-orchestration-windows/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon ECS now supports on-premises workload orchestration on Windows OS</a>.</li>
<li> More Windows support arrives, this time for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/windows-containerd-runtime-eks-kubernetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">containerd runtime on EKS</a> starting with Kubernetes 1.21. We don’t know about you, but we’re starting to get releases mixed up here. </li>
<li> Don&#8217;t get fooled by the marketing folks: There’s still work for the dev team to do with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-appconfig-feature-flags/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">general availability of AWS AppConfig Feature Flags</a>.</li>
<li> We’re not sure who wants to use this, but Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL <a h]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team reminisces about dealing with awful database technologies, which Ryan luckily managed to avoid. Plus all things cybersecurity as Linux gets hit with a huge security emergency, Google acquires Mandiant for $5.4 billion, and Orca Security catches a major Azure cross-tenant vulnerability. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Linux is on the backfoot as it’s hit by the most severe vulnerability in years.</li>
<li> Google has acquired the cybersecurity giant Mandiant for a cool $5.4 billion.</li>
<li> Orca Security catches a huge Azure cross-tenant vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> ”But is Mandiant now going to be suddenly finding the vulnerabilities and publishing the vulnerabilities that they&#8217;re finding in Azure and AWS, and happen to maybe not mention the ones externally that are happening in GCP? They&#8217;re no longer an independent third party.”</li>
<li> “Even with these things happening, you&#8217;re still safer running in the cloud. Even though there are outages, you&#8217;re still more highly available in the cloud. I hate to see these things in the news.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Linux Is Feeling the Pain</h3>
<ul>
<li> Knative is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/knative-becomes-a-cncf-project/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now officially a CNCF incubating project</a> — any competitors in the market?</li>

</ul>
<h3>AWS: Solving Very Cloudy Problems </h3>
<ul>
<li> Faster failover is the name of the game with AWS this week: its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-rds-multi-az-db-cluster/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RDS for MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL Multi-AZ</a> deployment option comes with improved write performance. Jonathan is also very, very excited about their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/amazon-web-services-jdbc-driver-mysql-failover/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JDBC driver for MySQL</a>.</li>

But who watches the watchmen? </li>
<li> Ryan’s always suffered from slow performance, but now he can now get specific about how his bad code is affecting it, thanks to Amazon DevOps Guru’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/amazon-devops-guru-support-lambda-codeguru-profiler-integration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">extended support for Lambda</a> with CodeGuru Profiler integration.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Getting Out the Wallet </h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/08/google-to-acquire-cybersecurity-company-mandiant-for-5-4b/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google pays $5.4 billion in hush money to Mandiant</a> in a move that’s sure to massively boost their credibility in the cybersecurity arms race.

	<title>155: The Cloud Pod Shows Green in the New AWS Status Page</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team heads down a Cisco business model rabbithole. Plus cloud status pages struggle with reality, AWS is tracking carbon footprints, and Microsoft sees serious security business growth with Defender. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Cloud status pages aren’t reflecting reported issues, in what appears to be a cover-up by error-shy cloud providers.</li>
<li> AWS introduces a new carbon footprint dashboard to help customers track their sustainability for cleaner, greener living.</li>
<li> Following on the heels of AWS and Azure, Microsoft Defender now provides security on Google Cloud, and is also available for Azure Cosmos DB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p> “Understanding the thresholds would be nice, but it&#8217;s difficult, because if you have an instance up and running just fine, but you can&#8217;t launch a new instance, is EC2 down? Is the control plane being down the same as the service itself being down? The ability to launch a new instance would be fairly instrumental to using the service. There&#8217;re lots of very fine distinctions made between whether something&#8217;s working or not. I think a little more transparency is needed. But I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re trying to mislead anybody.”</p>
<p> “They&#8217;re so strong in other areas, I think it&#8217;s a mistake to try to compete everywhere with the two other companies that are roughly [their] size. Do the thing you&#8217;re really good at and just keep doing it better.”</p>
<h3>General News: Move Along, Everything’s Fine Here</h3>
<ul>
<li> It seems like cloud providers are on a customer gaslighting mission, with cloud status pages <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/24/cloud_service_status_pages_fail/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">not reflecting reported issues</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Continuing Its Tradition of Silly Names</h3>
<ul>
<li> In a badly timed announcement, AWS shows off its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/aws-health-dashboard-first-iteration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new unified Health Dashboard</a>. It does make sense to <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">keep it in one place</a>, though.</li>
<li> Amazon S3 showcases important, super valuable new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-additional-checksum-algorithms-for-amazon-s3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">additional checksum algorithms</a>. If it’s computationally expensive, push it back onto the client. </li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/amazon-ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools-supports-hibernating-returning-instances-warm-pools-scale-in/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Warm Pools</a> has two new hibernation and scale-in features — a great solution for penny-pinchers who invested in Windows.</li>
<li> The new <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudsaga" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS CloudSaga</a> tool allows for security event simulation and testing. A great first step in what should prove to be cheaper than bringing in a whole team to do it. </li>
<li> How many IPv6 workloads are you running? Now you can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/let-your-ipv6-only-workloads-connect-to-ipv4-services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">connect them to IPv4 Services</a>.</li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>

<li> AWS is getting quick and rusty this week with s2n-quic, its new open-source protocol for Rust implementation.</li>
<li> GCP announces Dataplex in Google Cloud is now generally available, enabling the creation of the data mesh view. </li>

<li> “We must be hitting some huge brick walls in web performance that are really hurting certain application workloads that require low latency, because if you look at both these announcements back-to-back, they&#8217;re really trying to improve performance.”</li>
<li> “This is definitely a hard problem for companies to solve. Data is not going to be uniform, and you&#8217;re going to have many different sources of it, and you want it to all play nice together so it&#8217;s usable across a larger view than it used to be. I like these types of solutions, where they&#8217;re applying governance and a way of doing things that&#8217;s not just everyone reinventing these wheels — which is what we&#8217;ve been doing up until now.”</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Jonathan’s got his detective hat on. Plus Akamai steps up to CloudFare with Linode acquisition, AWS’ CloudFormation Hooks lift us up, and EPYC instances are now available.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Akamai notes CloudFare’s aggressive pivot to edge computing and acquires AWS competitor Linode for $900m.</li>
<li> AWS announces the general availability of AWS CloudFormation Hooks, which should prove very useful.</li>
<li> Amazon provides EPYC-powered instances, with up to 15% improvement in price-performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “When AWS announces general availability of an instance, I have never been unable to launch that instance to test it. … I can&#8217;t say the same thing for workloads on GCP.”</li>
<li> “If you ever take a laptop that has no security patches on it and you put it on a network … it&#8217;ll be hacked within minutes. It&#8217;s crazy how bad it is, actually. This is what we always talk about: it’s when you get hacked, not if you get hacked. Because if you have vulnerabilities, there&#8217;s always a chance. It&#8217;s just a matter of time before someone figures it out.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Akamai Steps Up Its Game</h3>
<ul>
<li> Capitalizing on existing relationships, F5 unveils its new cloud platform <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/02/15/new-f5-cloud-platform-shows-huge-advantage-in-security-ceo-says/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">with a huge advantage in security</a> — but it might be a tough sell.</li>

</ul>
<h3>AWS: Getting Its CloudFormation Hooks In</h3>

<li> AWS announces the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/aws-announces-general-availability-aws-cloudformation-hooks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">general availability of its CloudFormation Hooks</a>. Very nice.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Ryan grapples with life in the confusion matrix. Plus money money money with Q4 2021 earnings announcements, shiny new digital badges from AWS, and Google Serverless Spark lights the way on data processing and data science jobs.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Q4 2021 earnings: Amazon and Microsoft are killing it with impressive cloud revenues (the only part we care about), and Google is losing money but its cloud is still growing.</li>
<li> Nothing much from AWS (again) as performance reviews continue over there; but there are some new digital badges to show off your AWS cloud storage knowledge.</li>
<li> Serverless Spark is now available on Google Cloud to simplify data processing and data science jobs, allowing more focus on code and logic, and less on managing clusters and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “There&#8217;s the rub: it&#8217;s in the details as usual. You do need to operate as a business and achieve that transformation together. No matter what, any kind of migration is going to have an impact on product delivery and feature roadmap, which will have an impact on the ability to sell. So it really does take everyone marching to the same tune in order to get that done, or it just causes infighting.”</li>
<li> “The safest move is always to take a small [proof of concept], push that, and do your cloud landing zone with that… But then you&#8217;re left — at a certain point — with the thing that makes you the most amount of money [not fitting] your plans… It&#8217;s a huge risk: a lot of businesses get stuck trying to modernize. How do you justify the interruption to the revenue streams and the lack of feature delivery while you&#8217;re doing that transformation to the thing that pays all the bills?”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Q4 2021 Earnings Are In and It’s Looking Good</h3>
<ul>
<li> Some serious cloud revenue growth reports from <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-fourth-quarter-results" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2022-q2/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=d72fc76" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alphabet</a> with growth at 40% or higher, despite Amazon losses. And if you ever want to own Google stock, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-shares-jump-7-on-big-sales-earnings-11643750701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now’s your chance</a>.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, we’re back to a full house (at least for one episode.) Plus, introducing AWS open-source Cloud Map, GCP announces new Bigtable autoscale feature, and Oracle gives us a retro tour of a data center.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> In a move that shows it supports open source when convenient, AWS introduces new Cloud Map capabilities, and U-turns on proposed charges after 30 days. The new console still sucks, by the way.</li>
<li> GCP introduces the very welcome Bigtable autoscaling feature, with new optimizing and manageability features and improvements.</li>
<li> Oracle comes bearing over a hundred gifts from its blog, and gives us a look inside a data center. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I&#8217;m starting to wonder what&#8217;s going on over at AWS. We’ve talked about the Orca issues, the security rollout … And now we have this: We&#8217;re turning on things in your account that are going to cost you money. I saw the earnings… they look pretty good, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure why they&#8217;re turning on features that cost money — with no notice — and putting the onus on me to turn this stuff off.”</li>
<li> “So isn&#8217;t that really just a rehashing of the same problem that most IT professionals have been doing for the last 20 years? On the other hand, I don&#8217;t want to manage my own legacy Oracle footprint, so the fact that they&#8217;re going to take that, move it to the cloud, and then run it for me — I&#8217;m all for that.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Zero Trust ‘Hijacked’ by Network Security Firms </h3>
<ul>
<li>0&#x20e3; Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/31/zscaler-ceo-network-security-firms-have-hijacked-zero-trust/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gets us wise to network security firm marketing tactics</a>, highlighting that practicing zero trust and investing in network security are incompatible with each other.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Not Amazon’s Best Month… </h3>
<ul>
<li> In a ridiculous move that completely violates the trust of its customers, AWS attempts to charge after a 30-day trial when no one is paying attention — <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/amazon-guardduty-elastic-kubernetes-service-clusters/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">but everyone noticed</a>. First Orca, now this.</li>
<li> Watch out you don’t make your CFO cry with the launch of the very nice but very expensive <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-x2iezn-instances-powered-by-the-fastest-intel-xeon-scalable-cpu-for-memory-intensive-workloads/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new Amazon X2iezn instances</a>.</li>
<li> AWS shows its open-source credentials — but only because it’s convenient — with the rollout of the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-the-aws-cloud-map-multicluster-service-controller-for-k8s-for-kubernetes-multicluster-service-discovery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Cloud Map MCS Controller for K8s</a>.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Jonathan is still AWOL. Also Amazon is on GuardDuty with credential exfiltration, Google Cloud Deploy is generally available, and Azure is suffering from more serious DDoS attacks. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon’s been on GuardDuty with enhanced detection of EC2 instance credential exfiltration. </li>
<li> Google Cloud Deploy (GCD) is now generally available, making continuous delivery on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) easier.</li>
<li> Azure reports that it spent the last half of 2021 dealing with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that are increasing in both severity and frequency. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “The biggest risk to cloud infrastructure is that you’re one secret access key away from a big booboo.”</li>
<li> “Last November, [Azure] had just mitigated a pretty large attack — at the time the largest in history, at least from ones that have been reported to the world. … Things have gotten worse in Q3 and Q4 — not only the levels [of attacks], but the complexity has gotten worse.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Beefing Up GuardDuty</h3>
<ul>
<li>  The threat detection service Amazon GuardDuty — which monitors your accounts for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior — is pretty great already. In the aftermath of the <a href="https://orca.security/resources/blog/aws-glue-vulnerability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Superglue issue</a>, however, AWS is ramping things up with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-guardduty-enhances-detection-of-ec2-instance-credential-exfiltration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">enhanced detection of EC2 instance credential exfiltration</a>.</li>
<li> AWS Security Hub has been integrating with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/aws-security-hub-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Health</a> and with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/aws-trusted-advisor-security-hub/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Trusted Advisor</a> (TA). Does this mean everything annoying gets reflagged? Thanks, TA!</li>
<li> In a move that makes a lot of sense, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/amazon-ecs-exec-linux-2-container-workloads/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supports ECS Exec and Amazon Linux 2 </a>for workloads running on-premises with Amazon ECS Anywhere. No more yum and Red Hat-based Fedora deployment sounds great, although it would be nice to have a few more implementation details ahead of rolling it out.</li>
<li>  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-replication-for-amazon-elastic-file-system-efs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Replication is now possible for Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a>, but watch out for those pesky inter-region transfer fees — which do rack up — before enabling this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCP: Google Cloud Deploy Makes Your Life Easier</h3>

<li> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-now-ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Deploy (GCD) is now generally available</a>, making it easier to do continuous delivery to GKE. We’ve also done the math on this and it seems to be cheaper than Ryan: GCD customers get their first active delivery pipeline per account free, and pay a $15/month management fee for each additional pipeline. Whereas Ryan is, frankly, expensive.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team decides 2022 is already a long, cursed year — bring on 2023. Plus nuggets of wisdom from Gartner, Orca discovers breaksformation and Glue vulnerabilities, and 10 questions to help boards (and others) maximize cloud opportunities.</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Gartner reveals six cloud trends for 2022: Take what you need for your organization and throw away the rest.</li>
<li> Orca Security discovers vulnerabilities in AWS’ CloudFormation, and — more seriously — Glue.</li>
<li> GCP releases 10 questions to help boards safely maximize cloud opportunities — which can also give you the opportunity to bag that promotion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “Look at the rate of growth of cloud over the past few years. The rate of training new people could not possibly keep up. … [Organizations] want to hire someone who&#8217;s got 20 years’ experience in something that&#8217;s only been around for five years. I can see it being a real problem in terms of quality of output.”</li>
<li> “Because Orca published a blog post, we know about this — would AWS have disclosed it to us? If there are other people out there doing research against AWS and they&#8217;re not publishing these things, there could be other things that we don&#8217;t know about, that are not being addressed. Transparency is important.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Get Out the Crystal Balls </h3>
<ul>
<li> SiliconANGLE published <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/01/16/22-six-cloud-trends-year-ahead/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a guest blog from Gartner’s Paul Delory</a> on his six predictions for what is coming to the cloud in 2022.</li>
<li> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/18/5-considerations-for-saving-more-and-wasting-less-on-cloud-services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a> has five considerations for saving more and wasting less on cloud services. We didn’t learn much, but everyone’s mileage varies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: CloudFormation’s Breaking Apart and the Glue Doesn’t Stick</h3>
<ul>
<li> Orca Security Research Team’s been hunting in AWS waters, and <a href="https://orca.security/resources/blog/aws-cloudformation-vulnerability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">found a vulnerability</a> in CloudFormation. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2022-001/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS responded</a> that on further inspection, there was no threat to customers or resources.</li>
<li> There’s something more troublesome afoot, though: The Orca team also <a href="https://orca.security/resources/blog/aws-glue-vulnerability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">discovered a vulnerability with Glue</a>. AWS Principal Engineer Anthony Virtuoso <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2022-002/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">thanked Orca for its findings</a>: but a coordinated effort between AWS and Orca might have avoided all of this. </li>
<li> AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/a-new-aws-console-home-experience/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">releases its new console</a> which, overall, looks a lot like the old one with new lipstick — it still doesn’t appear to deliver.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Peter finally gets to share his top announcements of 2021. Plus, Google increases security with Siemplify, Azure updates Defender, and AWS comes into the new year with a lot of changes.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning, and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS confirms that applications can now be deployed on Amazon EKS using the IPv6 address space.</li>
<li> Google looks to boost its security operations by acquiring SOAR provider Siemplify.</li>
<li> Azure spent December updating Defender: was it worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p> “All the cloud providers are embracing containerization and the technologies that allow containerized workloads to work well on their platform. But the side effect is that they also run equally well on everybody else&#8217;s platform.” </p>
<p> “[As Vice President of Google Cloud Phil Venables wrote in a blog post,] ‘The race by deep-pocketed cloud providers to create and implement leading secure technologies is the tip of the spear of innovation.’ Which is interesting, because I think this is an area where Google&#8217;s really crushed it, and I think Amazon has failed. Not failed, but not invested as much as they should have.”</p>
<h3>General News: Google Acquires Siemplify</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/04/google-cloud-acquires-siemplify-for-boosting-security-operations/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google acquired Siemplify</a>, a security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) provider. The hope appears to be that it will help security teams using GCP better manage their threat responses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Plenty of Non-Outage News</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-adds-ipv6-networking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IPv6 applications are now deployable</a> through Amazon’s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This prevents IP exhaustion, minimizes latency, and simplifies routing configurations. On the downside, IPv6 can’t be added retroactively, and this EKS add-on only supports Linux — a dealbreaker for the team.</li>
<li> The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/aws-compute-optimizer-multiple-ec2-instance-architectures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS compute optimizer has been enhanced</a> to allow users to specify both x86 and ARM as their preferred architecture for their EC2 instance type recommendations. This is a big blow to other tools that perform the same operations. </li>
<li> AWS announced the<a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-ec2-hpc6a-instances" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> general availability of the EC2 Hpc6a Instance</a>. It’s built for HPC workloads to leverage AMD EPYC 3rd-generation processors. This release expands AWS’ portfolio of HPC compute options. Plus, according to Justin, the instance name reminds him of the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaFd8ucHLuo" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“abcdefu” by GAYLE</a>.</li>
<li> According to a recent job posting, AWS plans to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-new-project-reimagine-network-job-posting-2022-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">completely re-imagine how its network is managed</a>. It allegedly has two secret projects that could mitigate the risk of cloud outages — like the one that impacted the company in December of 2021.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>EDITORIAL NOTE: Your Cloud Pod hosts are on vacation until early January!! Enjoy our 2021 wrapup and look ahead to 2022 and we&#8217;ll be back in your Podcast feed mid January! </strong></p>
<p>Justin, Jonathan, and Ryan are minus Peter in this episode as they review the year in cloud computing.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"> It’s the last podcast of 2021. The next one premieres in the third week of January.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"> Log4j came back with a vengeance during the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/using-aws-security-services-to-protect-against-detect-and-respond-to-the-log4j-vulnerability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">holiday season</a>.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"> The team looks back at its 2021 predictions and forecast for 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Log4jackass</h3>
<ul>
<li> Using AWS security services to protect against, detect, and respond to the log4j vulnerability is still an issue. Suggestions to upgrade to version 2.16 for Apache log4j security issue for EKS, ECS, and Fargate customers wasn’t enough. Customers are asked to upgrade to 2.17. By the end of 2021, it will probably be 2.22 just to get into the spirit. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Did The Team’s 2021 Predictions Come True?</h3>
<p> The hosts reviewed their 2021 predictions to see if they came true.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Johnathan’s prediction about bracket computing and other quantum technology didn’t come true to break TLS. It’s still a long way off but there are now more classes in quantum programming to prepare for the cutover. Jonathan takes half a point on his merit.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Peter believed The biggest blocker to cloud adoption would be costs, with individuals spending too much on poor cloud migrations. Justin believes he’s way off on this prediction. Though cost is a big consideration it’s definitely not the blocker. However, Jonathan believes more controls are needed to prevent overspending.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Justin’s prediction on the verticalization of the cloud in fintech, health, retail, etc. came true. Ryan says it makes a lot of sense for industries to go this route instead of building everything out. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ryan said work from home (WFH) would be a permanent trend, further breaking traditional security. Justin agreed on the first part but not the second on security issues. Though plenty of workers still log in through their companies’ VPNs, there is a big move to implement zero-trust security. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Favorite Announcements Of 2021</h3>
<p> The hosts reviewed their favorite announcements of 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Justin is happy that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-redshift-serverless-run-analytics-at-any-scale-without-having-to-manage-infrastructure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon released its Redshift Serverless program</a> to compete with Snowflake</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Jonathan’s most favorite announcement was<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> the introduction of OpenSearch</a>. Especially how it went from notification to general release in a short period. Justin is impressed at the community working to improve OpenSearch. He hears more about this product now than elasticsearch.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Oracle finally has some news to share. Plus Log4j is ruining everyone’s lives, AWS suffers a massive outage post re:Invent, and Google CAT releases its first threat report. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> A critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j wrought havoc over the weekend. Cloud platforms and developers alike are racing to fix the bug, which gives hackers an opportunity to take control of systems remotely. </li>
<li> On the heels of re:Invent, AWS suffered a major outage last Tuesday in its US-EAST-1 region, which had staggering repercussions across the cloud. </li>
<li> Google Cybersecurity Action Team (CAT) releases its first Threat Horizons report, revealing its top three concerns threatening cloud users today.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “It’s amazing how much of our infrastructure and applications live on these open source contributions of one or two people, and how critical they are to the entire ecosystem. And when they break or they&#8217;re vulnerable, it becomes a huge issue for us very quickly.”</li>
<li> “Think about what Microsoft did: They started signing device drivers and signing applications that run in Windows, and everyone thought Oh, they’re just exerting control, what a terrible idea. They&#8217;re just trying to corner the market. And now, of course, 15 years later, binding authorization is probably the most critical next step in securing the cloud.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: The Log4j Vulnerability is COVID for Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li> In light of the critical Apache Log4j 2.0 vulnerability that gives attackers the ability to to execute arbitrary code on other systems, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS has released a hotpatch</a> for the logging platform. The aim is to help developers mitigate risk as they work to update their systems to 2.15 or newer. </li>
<li> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/10/the-log4j-vulnerability-is-bad-heres-the-good-news/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a> reminds us that while the Log4j debacle is bad, at least organizations now have tools and processes in place to respond quickly to zero-day bugs. </li>
<li> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/recommendations-for-apache-log4j2-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GCP has released a set of recommendations</a> for those who are investigating and responding to the Log4j 2.0 vulnerability. </li>
<li> To help customers detect whether their systems have been compromised by the Log4j bug, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ids-to-help-detect-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google has updated its IDS signature</a> to automatically scan for any Log4j exploit attempts. </li>
<li> Google creates a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-armor-waf-rule-to-help-address-apache-log4j-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule</a> to detect and block Log4j exploit attempts by attackers. </li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon’s re:Invent 2021 featured a ton of new updates, including AWS CloudWatch Evidently, AWS Private 5G, and a new AWS Sustainability Pillar. </li>
<li> Justin’s prediction pick — Graviton 3 — was announced on Day Two of re:Invent, along with serverless options for data analytics, and a free machine learning (ML) database for existing AWS customers. </li>
<li> Amazon CEO Adam Selipsky missed the mark at his re:Invent debut, announcing fewer new releases than expected to a low-energy crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p> “This is Adam’s [Selipsky] first keynote as CEO of AWS… I do feel it was a missed opportunity. Number one, he didn&#8217;t drive out a ton of announcements, which everyone expected. There was a miss across the entire audience — people were expecting something they didn&#8217;t get. And then number two, OK, maybe you&#8217;re not the best public speaker: maybe you should go with a different model.”</p>
<p> “In the keynote, the message was really clear: They&#8217;re trying to democratize access to machine learning, they&#8217;re trying to give this access to more than just the elite data scientists and programmers. And that made me think that if you expand that out to no-code in general, that’s a really powerful thing”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>The Cloud Pod: Oh the Places You’ll Go at re:Invent 2021 — Episode 144</p>
<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, as a birthday present to Ryan, the team didn&#8217;t discuss his advanced age, and focused instead on their AWS re:Invent predictions. Also, the Google Cybersecurity Action Team launches a product, and Microsoft announces a new VM series in Azure.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS releases new G5 instances, which feature up to eight NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs. That’s super, super fast. </li>
<li> Google’s Cybersecurity Action Team adds Risk and Compliance as Code (rCaC) Solution.</li>
<li> Microsoft announces the NDm A100 v4 Series, and claims another spot on the  TOP500 supercomputers list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Top Quotes  </h2>
<ul>
<li>  “[AWS Resilience Hub] is already building on top of the FIS, which is interesting, but at some level I just want you to execute Lambda functions that validate things for me, and then tell me that I&#8217;m resilient because I validated it with Lambda.”</li>
<li> “Anything that empowers more dynamic and interactive web development I&#8217;m all for.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Give Us Your Car  </h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS is releasing new G5 instances, which feature up to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-instances-g5-with-nvidia-a10g-tensor-core-gpus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">eight NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs</a>. For the cost of a small car every month, you too can get up to 40% better value on inferencing and graphics-intensive operations.</li>
<li> AWS is releasing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/monitor-and-improve-your-application-resiliency-with-resilience-hub/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Resilience Hub</a>, a service designed to help you define, track and manage the resilience of your applications.</li>
<li> Unified Search in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/unified-search-aws-management-console-blogs-knowledge-articles-events-tutorials/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a> now sources results from blogs, knowledge articles, events and tutorials. Buyer beware with this one: It will pull outdated information that is still available on AWS, and you could end up with a giant albatross that costs you a fortune.</li>
<li> Amazon ECS is improving ECS Capacity Providers to deliver faster <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-ecs-improved-capacity-providers-cluster-auto-scaling/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cluster auto scaling</a>. When you&#8217;re using a capacity provider, it&#8217;s painfully slow to get the underlying hosting infrastructure to scale fast enough, so we’re presuming AWS has addressed this in the back end.</li>

<li> Amazon ECS adds container instance <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-ecs-container-instance-health-information/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">health information</a>. This is nice to see and will help]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the pod squad is down to the OG three while Ryan is away. Also AWS announces serverless pipelines, GCP releases Spot Pods, and Azure introduces Chaos Studio. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS releases Serverless Application Model (SAM) pipelines to save development teams time. These pipelines streamline CI/CD configurations for AWS applications. </li>
<li> In the spirit of savings, new GCP Spot Pods help GKE Autopilot users run fault-tolerant workloads while spending less money. Hooray!</li>
<li> Azure Chaos Studio helps development teams wreak controlled havoc with a managed experimentation service, allowing them to safely build, break and optimize their apps with reckless abandon. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I think for some people when they&#8217;re looking at, OK, we&#8217;re gonna make this commitment to a different architecture, at that point in time, they&#8217;ve looked at serverless versus containerized apps, and most companies went the containerized apps route, but that might change in the next wave.” </li>
<li> “Python 3.10 looks really interesting. It&#8217;s got a bunch of new features … around data handling specifically, which is really what people have been using Python for for years: bioinformatics and data science. But it has really neat features around matching different schemas of data and things like that.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Finally, a Pipeline We Can Get Behind</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/ci-cd-configuration-aws-serverless-applications-system-general-availability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS releases Serverless Application Model (SAM) pipelines</a>, a new feature of the AWS SAM CLI, to help users simplify CI/CD configurations for AWS serverless applications. The new feature will help development teams minimize the amount of time spent creating pipelines, while also ensuring safe deployments. </li>
<li> With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-fault-injection-simulator-amazon-cloudwatch-alarms-automation-runbooks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Fault Injection Simulator</a>, users can now create and run FIS experiments that check the state of Amazon CloudWatch alarms and run SSM automations. We hope the only fault injections you have are in your EC2 instances, not in your Thanksgiving turkey. </li>
<li> AWS customers running Windows containers rejoice: New <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-amazon-ecs-exec-to-access-your-windows-containers-on-amazon-ec2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon ECS Exec</a> allows you to execute commands or get information directly from your Windows container shell. Magic!</li>
<li> Amazon is doubling down on Canada. <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-plans-open-second-region-canada-western" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS announced plans to open a second Canadian region</a>, in Calgary, bringing the company’s total region count to nine.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team wishes for time-traveling data. Also, GCP announces Data Lakehouse, Azure hosts Ignite 2021, and Microsoft is out for the metaverse. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> GCP releases its data lakehouse, a new architecture that offers low-cost storage in an open format. The real question is, can we book it on Airbnb?</li>
<li> Microsoft kicks off Azure Ignite 2021, announcing new capabilities for its hybrid, multicloud and edge computing platforms. </li>
<li> Microsoft also unveils plans for its own metaverse, including upgrades to Teams, Dynamic 365 Connected Spaces and more. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I&#8217;m a big fan of IDE for coding and that integrated environment to reduce context shifting, but when you&#8217;re talking about access to data, Jupyter is something that&#8217;s hosted, that you can protect and grant access to, versus an IDE like RStudio. It becomes a much trickier scenario to maintain any kind of data sovereignty, or protect that in any way, just because, by its true nature, you have to open it up.”</li>
<li> “Between the Facebook Metaverse and Microsoft, who&#8217;s going to win the race? Everyone wants to build “Ready Player One.” And Facebook owns Oculus and they have all my data, then they can get my brain as well: They can just monetize the crap out of my profile. And then Microsoft  has their augmented reality things… . But I think the power of the Azure cloud actually gives them the advantage versus Facebook, in my opinion. “</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: ‘Tis Earnings Season</h3>
<ul>
<li>​​ Microsoft was the first to announce its <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-profits-jump-48-20b-big-quarter-cloud-business/?mc_cid=8123fb9dd0&amp;mc_eid=04fad859c0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">quarterly revenue, boasting a $45 billion increase</a>. This jump of 22% <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/10/26/strong-cloud-sales-microsoft-comfortably-beats-earnings-targets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">beats Wall Street expectations</a>, and includes Microsoft Azure, LinkedIn commercial revenue, Office 365, and Xbox.  </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/alphabet-goog-earnings-q3-2021.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google also posted impressive results</a>, rounding out the quarter at $18.9 billion, up a whopping 68% from one year ago. Much of this success came from <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/10/26/google-ads-cloud-computing-keep-alphabet-humming/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Ads and GCP</a>, where revenue was up 45% or about $5 billion. </li>
<li> Due to ongoing supply chain issues and labor shortages, <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-results-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon missed the mark</a> on its earnings forecast, posting a profit of $3.2 billion, a 49% decrease from last year. AWS, however, outperformed (as usual), with a <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-results-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">39% rise in revenue to $16.1 billion.</a> </li>

	<title>TCP Talks: From Monolith to Microservices: Jonathan Heiliger on Modern IT Service Management</title>
	<link>https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/it-service-management-jonathan-heiliger/</link>
	<pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=3365</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Jonathan Heiliger, co-founder and partner at <a href="https://www.vertexventures.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vertex Ventures</a>: an early-stage venture capital firm backing innovative technology entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Earlier in his career, at just 19, Jonathan co-founded web hosting provider GlobalCenter and served as CTO. He went on to hold engineering roles at Walmart and Danger, Inc., the latter of which was acquired by Microsoft. He was also Vice President of Infrastructure and Operations at Facebook (now Meta), and a general partner at North Bridge Ventures. The latter firm’s portfolio included Quora, Periscope, and Lytro (which has been acquired by Google.)</p>
<p>At Vertex Ventures, Jonathan has helped cutting-edge companies like LaunchDarkly and OpsLevel revolutionize the tech space with continuous delivery and IT service management solutions. Jonathan shares his insights into the shifting market of IT services and explains why decentralizing infrastructure management can help digitally native companies operate at a faster pace.</p>
<p>According to Jonathan, the question of IT service infrastructure isn’t being adequately addressed. Without properly defining service ownership, businesses looking to scale run the risk of siloing critical knowledge, and losing track of services networks. </p>
<p>Jonathan also discusses his own experiences running infrastructure at Facebook (oops, Meta), the merits of both centralized and decentralized IT services management, and how he and his partners at Vertex Ventures approach new investments.  </p>
<h2>Featured Guest</h2>
<p> Name: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jheiliger/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan Heiliger</a></p>
<p> What he does: Jonathan is a co-founder and partner at <a href="https://www.vertexventures.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vertex Ventures</a>, an early stage venture capital firm that backs B2B software entrepreneurs. He held his first CTO role at 19, and has previously worked for Walmart; Danger, Inc.; Facebook (soon to be known as Meta); and North Bridge Ventures.</p>
<p> Key quote: “We need systems to help us build bridges from the world of paper-based and in-memory to scaling to tens and then hundreds of microservices. It’s that pain point of tracking all the info about apps and their services, dependencies, ownership and versions that I think is this big problem lurking below the surface.”</p>

<p> As companies rely on an increasing number of IT services, Jonathan says that it’s imperative that technology leaders establish ownership of IT service management, and meticulously track their software and vendor partners. </p>
<p>According to Jonathan, this kind of IT management is still done in a fairly rudimentary way, even for larger companies. “Every engineering team — even the most well run engineering orgs — the majority of them use Excel spreadsheets to track who owns what service, and even what services may talk to one another,” he says. He sees this as a big problem that’s going to catch up with companies one day.</p>
<p> When considering whether a centralized or decentralized IT management service infrastructure is best for you, Jonathan suggests doing a deep dive on your business objectives. </p>
<p>For example, digitally native businesses, which rely on a vast network of microservices, might work better with a decentralized infrastructure. Non-digitally native brands, on the other hand, might benefit from a centralized system to ensure continuity in the technology. </p>
<p> Avoiding vendor lock-in — i.e. becoming too dependent on a single service provider — is critical in keeping]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, half the team misses Rob and Ben. Also, AWS Gaudi Accelerators speed up deep learning, GCP announces that its Tau VMs are an independently verified delight, and Azure gets the chance to be Number One for once (with industrial IoT platforms.)</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>  AWS is using Gaudi Accelerators to speed up deep learning models — for nearly $10,000 a month. </li>
<li> Google announces that Tau T2D VMs are now available in preview, and takes the opportunity to report that Phoronix has identified these Tau instances as the best price-performing ones yet. </li>
<li> Azure bags the Number One spot in the Gartner Magic Quadrant category of Industrial IoT Platforms. We’re wondering how much schmoozing Microsoft had to do to pull this off. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p> “I guess [AWS Gaudi Accelerators] solve the problem of lack of availability of NVIDIA CPUs. It&#8217;s almost impossible to buy a decent graphics card, and I&#8217;m sure the cloud providers are suffering horrendously with not being able to scale their machine-learning instances the way they wanted to, because of the chip shortage.”</p>
<p> “We&#8217;ve said it for a long time now that with Google coming to the market when they did, it was very easy to take all the major gripes of AWS and Azure and improve on them. And they banged it out of the park. So kudos to them, because it is a much better user experience than [what you get with] the other two cloud providers.”</p>
<h3>General News: HashiCorp Increases Access to its Service Mesh</h3>
<p> HashiCorp introduces its new <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-consul-api-gateway" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Consul API Gateway</a> to help route traffic to applications running on the Hashicorp Consul Service Mesh. This seems like an early release, given its fairly basic capabilities.</p>
<h3>AWS: Rolling Out Gaudi Accelerators — Not Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/computer-vision-at-the-edge-with-aws-panorama/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Panorama</a>, which is an appliance and SDK that allows users to process video data at the edge of their locations. AWS Panorama was first introduced at the last re:Invent, and is now <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-general-availability-aws-panorama-appliance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">generally available</a>. </li>
<li> Amazon joins Microsoft, Google, IBM, Honeywell and more in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/amazon-quantum-computer-caltech/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">race to build a quantum computer</a>, partnering with Caltech to open a new center in Pasadena.  </li>
<li>4&#x20e3; To save Peter some time in the lightning round, we combined four Amazon DocumentDB updates into one announcement: Users can now enjoy additional support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/amazon-documentdb-access-control-user-roles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">access control</a>; support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/amazon-documentdb-adds-additional-mongodb-compatibility-apis/" rel="nofollow no]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team’s collective brain power got a boost from guest hosts Rob Martin of the FinOps Foundation and Ben Garrison of JumpCloud. Also, AWS releases Data Exchange, Google automates Cloud DLP, and Azure Synapse Analytics is available for pre-purchase. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces Data Exchange for Amazon Redshift, which will allow users access to and management of third-party data. Watch out, Snowflake.</li>
<li> Google is making its Cloud Data Loss Protection (DLP) automatic so users no longer have to worry about manually monitoring their data. </li>
<li> Azure has made Azure Synapse Analytics available for pre-purchase for customers looking to manage their analytics workloads. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p> “There&#8217;s always that line: If you build a module that is very effective for users across the board, regardless of what they&#8217;re doing, at some point it just becomes a resource. It’s pretty tough to build complex modules that everybody&#8217;s going to use as-is, and not want to end up making their own.”</p>
<p> “I do not envy security people in this current climate. The proliferation of cloud computing, edge computing, has really had to get a lot of creative minds working together to try and secure data outside your four walls of sanctity. … And so it&#8217;s good to see big companies starting to chime in and address that, because I think it&#8217;s just going to continue to keep growing.”</p>
<h3>General News: Hashicorp + AWS =  A Match Made in Heaven</h3>
<ul>
<li> At .conf21, Splunk announces a <a href="https://devops.com/splunk-expands-scope-of-observability-while-lowering-costs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new workload-based pricing model</a> for its smaller customers that will help drive retention. Clearly Splunk has been listening to TCP complaining about its insanely expensive model. </li>
<li>  <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-public-beta-of-hcp-packer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HashiCorp releases the public beta of HCP Packer</a>, which allows teams to track and automate build updates across their packer and terraform workflows. </li>
<li> AWS and HashiCorp are partnering to make developers’ lives easier with <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/aws-hashicorp-collaborate-new-terraform-modules" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new terraform modules for AWS</a>, as well as an API path that will enable users to quickly deploy AWS resources while keeping modules lightweight and composable. Justin is stoked for this!</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: AWS Data Exchange is Coming for Snowflake </h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS releases its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-the-security-at-the-edge-core-principles-whitepaper/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Security at the Edge: Core Principles</a> whitepaper to help business and technology leaders ensure their cloud network security extends to workloads running on the edge. The paper points out three strategic areas to address: AWS Services at the edge location, AWS security best practices, and additional edge services.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> We take a good, hard look at the ways <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3316436/13-ways-google-cloud-beats-aws.html?utm_content=content&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=organic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Cloud has AWS beat</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3>General News: Let Me Count the Ways</h3>
<ul>
<li> Peter Wayner of InfoWorld wrote an article listing the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3316436/13-ways-google-cloud-beats-aws.html?utm_content=content&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=organic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">13 ways</a> Google Cloud beats AWS. Well…he didn’t say they were all good reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: That’s a MTHFL</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announced the Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/introducing-the-cdk-for-kubernetes-a-new-software-development-framework-and-open-source-project-for-defining-kubernetes-applications-using-code/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cdk8s</a> is now in alpha. Rolls right off the tongue, doesn’t it?</li>
<li> You can now use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/ec2-instance-connect-supports-attribute-based-access-control/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Attribute-based access control</a> with EC2 Instance Connect to define Secure Shell access permissions based on attributes. It’s good to move away from passing around all those extra keys.</li>
<li> State Manager features for Systems Manager now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-systems-manager-enhances-support-for-state-manager-resources-in-aws-cloudformation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">integrate with AWS CloudFormation</a>. Assuming we’re parsing the naming conventions correctly in these press releases, that’s good news!</li>
<li> Amazon CodeGuru Profiler added <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/amazon-codeguru-announces-javaagent-switch-to-start-profiler/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">-javaagent switch</a>, and CodeGuru Reviewer now supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/amazon-codeguru-reviewer-announces-support-for-bitbucket-repositories-and-enhancements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud</a>. Obviously, profiling and reviewing are totally different services —   how could anyone get those mixed up?</li>
<li> The AWS CloudTrail console has been <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-cloudtrail-simplifies-trail-creation-management/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">redesigned</a>. It’s just the S3 user interface again, so it’s not a very intuitive interface.</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon picks fights with <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/12/05/not-so-fast-analyst-says-there-are-questions-over-whether-microsoft-can-deliver-on-jedi-reinvent/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">New York Times</a> and the <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/09/jedi_contract_complaint_amazon/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">President</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Oracle’s finances reflect the trouble <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/the-right-to-bare-arm-chips-ep-43/">we predicted</a> they’d be in when Amazon pulled out.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Google sets its sights on dramatically <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-brass-set-2023-as-deadline-to-beat-amazon-microsoft-in-cloud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">increasing its market share</a> by 2023.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Return of the JEDI</h3>
<p>It’s official: the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract has been awarded to Microsoft to modernize the Department of Defense’s IT systems to the tune of $10 billion. Amazon, which anticipated that it would be awarded the JEDI contract, believes the decision was <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/09/jedi_contract_complaint_amazon/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">politically motivated</a>, and that Microsoft is <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/12/05/not-so-fast-analyst-says-there-are-questions-over-whether-microsoft-can-deliver-on-jedi-reinvent/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">under-equipped</a> to deliver on their promises, highlighting the <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/06/project_jedi_decision/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dangers of a vulnerability</a> in such a sensitive system.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Sundar Pichai will be taking over as the <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/alphabet/letter-from-larry-and-sergey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new CEO of Google</a>. Since he was already the CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet, don’t expect any drastic changes.</p>
<p>And speaking of CEOs, Safra Catz is now <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/13/oracle_q2_fy2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">officially</a> the sole CEO of Oracle following the death of her co-CEO Mark Hurd. After Amazon’s migration, she’ll have to deal with the company’s <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/12/12/oracles-stock-drops-misses-revenue-targets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">revenue challenges</a> and falling stock prices. It’s not a great time for Oracle as the company continues to lose face with CIOs after years of licensing audits and exorbitant penalties. </p>
<h3>Football in the Amazon</h3>
<p>Amazon may have lost the contract with the DoD, but it can proudly claim to be the cloud computation provider for the <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/11/25/seat]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Cloud Pod, the team used their slightly cloudy crystal balls to share their predictions for Re:Invent 2020. They hope Amazon doesn’t ruin them before the event.</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon spoils the prediction party by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-network-firewall-new-managed-firewall-service-in-vpc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">revealing a new product</a> just before Re:Invent.</li>
<li> Google is making sandcastles by itself <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/introducing-the-anthos-developer-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the sandbox</a>. </li>
<li> Azure is smart enough not to announce <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/boost-your-client-performance-with-azure-files-smb-multichannel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anything exciting</a> right before Amazon’s big day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Crushing Hopes and Dreams</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon Lightsail lets developers easily <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/lightsail-containers-an-easy-way-to-run-your-containers-in-the-cloud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">deploy containers in the cloud</a>. This is like the cloud version of candy-flavored tobacco — somebody out there will be excited.</li>
<li> Amazon announces visual data preparation tool <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-glue-databrew-a-visual-data-preparation-tool-that-helps-you-clean-and-normalize-data-faster/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Glue DataBrew</a>. Really cool — we wish they’d created this sooner! </li>
<li> AWS Key Management Service now supports three new hybrid <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/round-2-post-quantum-tls-is-now-supported-in-aws-kms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">post-quantum key exchange algorithms</a>. We’re just happy that the defense is ahead of the offense this time.</li>
<li> Amazon launches AWS Network Firewall, a highly available, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-network-firewall-new-managed-firewall-service-in-vpc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">managed network firewall service for VPC</a>. Peter is angry that Amazon killed one of his Re:Invent predictions.</li>
<li> Introducing Amazon S3 Storage Lens for organization-wide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-storage-lens/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">visibility into object storage</a>. We think the dashboard is built on years of customer complaints, not experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Re:Invent Predictions</h3>
<p>Prediction rule: If it’s already been officially announced by Amazon, then it doesn’t count. It needs to be in the rumor mill and somewhat specific.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Peter
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration between Sumerian and Chime/Slack (messaging service) for virtual in-person meetings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Major upgrade to CloudWatch/Logs/GuardDuty/CloudWatch Events (SIEM) but an actual SIEM product. Will have its own name or does something to GuardDuty</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Robot SDK for tight integrations into AWS Cloud</li>
</ul>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, everyone’s favorite guessing game is back, with the team making their predictions for AWS Summit and re:Inforce — which were not canceled, as they led us to believe last week.                  </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS CTO talks about continuous configuration (CC) at Amazon <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/08/continuous-configuration-on-aws.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">in his latest blog post</a>. CC has made it possible for the company to keep services running while it also adapts and reacts in real-time. </li>
<li> Google launches monitoring and troubleshooting <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/better-access-to-observability-data-for-virtual-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for virtual machines (VMs)</a>. Developers will be able to access visual guides talking them through various scenarios.  </li>
<li> Microsoft launches a lawsuit in response to AWS <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/report-amazon-awarded-secret-10b-nsa-cloud-computing-contract-microsoft-files-protest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">winning a $10 billion NSA contract</a>, the content of which is reportedly related to the organization’s attempts to modernize the way it stores classified data.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “When it comes to streaming VR, you can be very smart about what you send to a consumer and what you don&#8217;t. I mean, there&#8217;s still enough compute power locally that it has a good idea of what most of the scenes can look like. So potentially, local computers do the background or the bits that are complex, and you just stream the complexity with the bits that do need to be latency sensitive.”</li>
<li> “I feel like all the monitoring tools out there have been missing this [monitoring and troubleshooting for VMs] for a long time, in that they seem to have all the features you need, but then getting the things you want is so difficult.” </li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Here We Go Again</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon has won a secret $10 billion cloud computing <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/report-amazon-awarded-secret-10b-nsa-cloud-computing-contract-microsoft-files-protest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">contract from the NSA</a>. This is JEDI all over again: Microsoft is not happy and has already launched a lawsuit.</li>
<li> AWS CTO Dr. Werner Vogels talks about <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/08/continuous-configuration-on-aws.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">continuous configuration at Amazon</a>. There are a lot of helpful tips in this article, particularly if you’re in Dev, DevOps or Ops.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: A Good Brew</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS Codebuild allows project owners to make build logs and artifacts publicly accessible to anyone <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/08/codebuild-supports-publicly-viewable-build-results/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">outside of AWS Console</a>. This is a great way to build trust in your product: thumbs up from us. </li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon is catering to the unimaginative with its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/05/announcing-general-availability-of-aws-application-migration-service/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">version of a vanilla milkshake</a>.</li>
<li> Google now performs commitment ceremonies but <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-committed-use-discounts-for-cloud-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they come at a cost</a>.</li>
<li> Azure did an online pastry course and <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/06/microsoft-upgrade-cloud-products-data-controls-eu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">can now make croissants</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: La France Est Méconnaître Amazon (France Is Ignoring Amazon)</h3>
<ul>
<li> VMware picks longtime executive <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/12/vmware-picks-longtime-executive-raghuram-new-ceo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Raghuram as its new CEO</a>. So many people were overlooked for this position.  </li>
<li> France says Google and Microsoft Cloud Services are <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/17/france-says-google-microsoft-cloud-services-are-ok-for-sensitive-data/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OK for storing sensitive data</a>. Bit of a snub for Amazon.    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Busy Little Bees</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS SaaS Boost <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-saas-boost-released-as-open-source/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">released as open source</a>. Sounds more like a product than it actually is.   </li>
<li> AWS announces general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/05/announcing-general-availability-of-aws-application-migration-service/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Application Migration Service</a>. If play is to lift and shift, with no thought of transformation at all, this is for you.    </li>
<li> AWS CloudFormation Guard 2.0 is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/05/aws-cloudformation-guard-2-0-is-now-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a>. It’s great that this supports more than just cloud transformation. </li>
<li> AWS Premium Support launches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/05/aws-premium-support-launches-support-automation-workflow-runbooks-for-self-service-diagnosis-remediation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Support Automation Workflows (SAW)</a>.

<li> Amazon announces the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-1-20-released/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">release of EKS 1.20</a> — the raddest release ever.  </li>
<li> AWS launches another way to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/app-runner-from-code-to-scalable-secure-web-apps/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">run containers with App Runner</a>.

<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure</li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> More conference <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/12/microsoft-cancels-its-build-developer-conference-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-wwdc-should-be-next/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cancellations</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/postponing-google-cloud-next20-digital-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roll in</a> due to the ongoing global pandemic.</li>
<li> Amazon Redshift made <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-redshift-launches-pause-resume/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-redshift-introduces-support-for-materialized-views/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">improvements</a> this week.</li>
<li> We take a look at a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/sre-keeps-digging-to-prevent-problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug-hunt</a> by a Site Reliability Engineer at Google.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Working From Home</h3>
<p> As the pandemic response ramps up across the world, teleconferencing services like Slack and Zoom <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/12/remote_work_struggles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">have struggled</a> to meet demand. Microsoft Teams users in Europe <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/16/microsoft-teams-struggles-as-coronavirus-pushes-millions-to-work-from-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> difficulty logging into the service. If you’re looking for an open-source web conferencing application, AWS recommends you use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/getting-started-with-jitsi-an-open-source-web-conferencing-solution/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jitsi</a>. If you’re a startup with more AWS credits to spend than money, we recommend you check it out.</p>
<p> In the continued wave of canceled conferences, Microsoft <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/12/microsoft-cancels-its-build-developer-conference-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-wwdc-should-be-next/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">moved the May 19-21 Build developer conference</a> to a virtual-only format. Even virtual conferences aren’t entirely safe bets, as Google has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/postponing-google-cloud-next20-digital-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponed</a> Google Cloud Next 2020: Digital Connect. Perhaps they will try to wait until they can safely host a physical conference again, but who knows when that will be?</p>
<h3>AWS: Redshifting Into Gear</h3>
<p> Amazon Redshift now allows users to<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-redshift-launches-pause-resume/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> pause and remove clusters</a> so they are not billed for their use while unneeded.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Your hosts (minus Jonathan) talk outages and instances on this week’s episode of The Cloud Pod.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Mark Russinovich (twitter: @markrussinovich) published a guide on scaling-up during the pandemic.</li>
<li> Sagemaker Ground Truth lets robots see in 3D.</li>
<li> Check out our <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/tcp-talks-with-amiram-shachar-reducing-cost-and-complexity-of-the-cloud-with-spot/">interview</a> with Spot CEO Amiram Schachar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Not Our Fault</h3>
<ul>
<li> IBM assigned the cause of a several-hour global outage on June 10 to an <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/11/ibm_cloud_outage_report/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unnamed third party</a>. We can expect a full formal report from IBM soon.</li>
<li> Data warehouse specialist company Snowflake is rumored to be filing for initial public offering at <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/10/snowflake_ipo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$20 billion</a>, 1,333% of its valuation just two and a half years ago. It’s just a matter of time until Amazon Redshift makes a move to break into Snowflake’s space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<ul>
<li> Chief Technical Officer at Azure Mark Russinovich detailed <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/advancing-microsoft-teams-on-azure-operating-at-pandemic-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how Azure scales Microsoft Teams during the pandemic</a> in what appears to be a face-saving measure after Azure’s recent capacity issues. It’s a weighty article — we recommend checking this one out for yourself if you’re encountering any scaling issues of your own.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: The Third Dimension is Data</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/software-package-management-with-aws-codeartifact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS CodeArtifact</a>, a managed artifact repository service, is now generally available. Everyone has to store their Build Artifacts somewhere, so this is an exciting tool, especially at this price point.</li>
<li> Amazon Sagemaker Ground Truth can now label <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-label-3d-point-clouds-with-amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">3D point clouds</a> using a new editor and assistive labeling features. We don’t know how this one works but expect widespread adoption in advanced machine learning.</li>
<li> New EC2 instances with Graviton2 processors are now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-ec2-c6g-r6g-instances-amazon-graviton2-processors-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">generally available</a>. Whether you choose C6 or R6, expect some hefty price-performance improvements.</li>
<li> AWS Lambda functions can now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-a-shared-file-system-for-your-lambda-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">connect to Amazon Elastic File Systems</a>. Sure, some people may make the point that this runs counter to the purpose of Lambda, but just think of the use cases!</li>
<li> The AWS CloudFormation Guard open-source command-line interface is now available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/introducing-aws-cloudformation-guard-preview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">preview</a>. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of remediation, and it’s good to see that made easy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General News: Ryan Doesn’t Want to Wear Pants</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon has kicked controversial social media <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parler-shutdown-by-amazon-might-not-be-fatal-to-the-social-network-2021-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">platform Parler off AWS</a>. The multi-cloud people are going to be unbearable now.    </li>
<li> Amazon defends its decision to suspend <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">in response to Parler’s lawsuit</a>. Most people don’t know Amazon sent Parler notices for months — it’s not like they weren’t warned.   </li>
<li> F5 Networks to <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/01/07/f5-networks-acquire-edge-service-startup-volterra-500m/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acquire edge-as-a-service startup Volterra</a> for $500M. There’s so much buzzword lingo in this announcement, we suspect this service will lack substance.</li>
<li> Red Hat <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/01/07/red-hat-buys-kubernetes-security-startup-stackrox/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">buys Kubernetes security startup</a> StackRox. We’re surprised Google didn’t buy it.</li>
<li> Pat Gelsinger is stepping down as VMWare CEO to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">replace Bob Swan at Intel</a>. We think he has a very long road ahead to get Intel back on track.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Family Time</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces Transfer Family now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-transfer-family-support-for-amazon-elastic-file-system/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">provides support for EFS file systems</a> as well as S3. Would be nice if this would tie into Incognito or Simple Directory Service.    </li>
<li> Amazon EMR now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/01/amazon-emr-now-supports-apache-ranger-for-fine-grained-data-access-control/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supports Apache Ranger</a> for fine-grained data access control. Neat. </li>

</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;"> This week’s highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fighting words from Amazon over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/jedi-why-we-will-continue-protest-politically-corrupted-contract-award/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JEDI loss</a>. </li>

</ul>
<h3>General: A Bit Picky </h3>
<ul>
<li> Business App Platform Progress will <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/chef-acquired-220m-progress-next-chapter-seattle-automation-tech-company/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acquire automation technology</a> company Chef for $220 million.

<li> AWS has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/jedi-why-we-will-continue-protest-politically-corrupted-contract-award/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">responded to the Pentagon</a> reaffirmation of Azure with a harshly worded blog post. Well, life’s just not fair.</li>
<li> Foghorn Consulting (sponsor alert!) are teaming up with Hashicorp and sponsoring <a href="https://events.hashicorp.com/virtualwkelsey-september24/foghorn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a virtual Q&amp;A with Kelsey Hightower</a> on September 24.

<h3>Amazon Web Services: You’ll Need Some Pain Relief</h3>

	<title>Get Your Hands Cloudy with Forrest Brazeal from A Cloud Guru &#8211; Episode 11</title>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=1023</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Forrest Brazeal, a Senior Manager at <a href="https://acloudguru.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Cloud Guru</a>, a cloud education platform that has attracted more than two million students. A Cloud Guru offers full certification training and technical deep dives for Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more.</p>
<p>Forrest talks about why companies need to invest in training to reap the benefits of “cloud fluency,” and how A Cloud Guru is contributing to cloud adoption success at Fortune 500 companies. </p>
<p>While discussing knowledge gaps, Forrest highlights how important it is to clearly identify which cloud services and knowledge areas you’re going to become certified in to avoid missing important high level areas. </p>
<p>“Going through the certification training and prep really helps you to avoid those blind spots that will keep you from speaking effectively to the other teams that you work with,” says Forrest. </p>
<h2>Featured Guest</h2>
<ul>
<li> Name: Forrest Brazeal</li>
<li> What he does: Forrest is a Senior Manager at cloud learning platform <a href="https://acloudguru.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Cloud Guru</a>.</li>
<li> Key quote: “When I look at people who are going from the data center to the cloud today, they are thinking about the cloud as something that&#8217;s going to take undifferentiated heavy lifting away from them.”</li>
<li> Where to find him: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> l <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Personal Website</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li> Be strategic with your cloud certifications. If you’re trying to reach a certain number of certifications, make sure you have a plan or you might end up with gaps in your knowledge. “It’s so easy to do, right?” Forrest says, “as I&#8217;m sitting on one team, and I&#8217;m touching one technology all the time, I could go two, three, four years and never know anything about networking because all I&#8217;m doing is databases, right? Or never know anything about compute, because all I&#8217;m doing is storage. Going through the certification training prep really helps you to avoid those blind spots that will keep you from speaking effectively to the other teams that you work with.”  </li>
<li> College grads beware: Just because you have a Computer Science degree doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll just be writing algorithms all day. If you’re looking at a career in programming, the day to day job includes negotiating with people and figuring out what requirements of the business are &#8211; not just writing algorithms. Forrest says  “it&#8217;s figuring out requirements, and it&#8217;s writing the same line of code and then deleting it because it turns out the business requirement changed.” </li>
<li> Scaling to zero, where a function can be reduced down to zero replicas when idle and brought back to the required amount of replicas when needed, is one example of how the underlying principles adopted by the serverless community that might have been considered “radical” five or six years ago is now seen as welcome wisdom in the broader cloud community. The term, “serverless,” might be retired eventually, but the fundamental principles will remain and evolve into “cloud native.” </li>
</ul>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Matthew Kohn joins the team as a substitute for Jonathan and Peter, who have gone AWOL. Also, Google demonstrates again why its network is superior to the other cloud providers.        </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS now allows crash-consistent AMIs without <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/06/amazon-ec2-allows-create-crash-consistent-amis-from-instances-multiple-amazon-ebs-volumes-without-rebooting-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">requiring a reboot</a>. No more manual processes needed. </li>
<li> Google is building a subsea cable <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/announcing-the-firmina-subsea-cable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named Firmina</a>. The cable, to be comprised of 12 fiber pairs, will carry traffic quickly and securely between North and South America.</li>
<li> Oracle announces improvements to its <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/300000-iops-per-volume-with-ultra-high-performance-oci-block-volumes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">block volumes</a>. Its Ultra-High-Performance (UHP) block volume comes with up to 300,000 IOPS and 2,680 MB/s throughput per volume and is generally available across all OCI commercial regions and on all interfaces. </li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Not Dead Yet</h3>
<ul>
<li> Hashicorp Vagrant 3.0 will maintain its Ruby-based features <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/toward-vagrant-3-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">while being ported to Go</a>. We thought this was on a path to death but apparently not.   </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Proceed With Caution</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces a new region in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-tel-aviv-israel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tel Aviv, Israel</a>. AWS clearly realized it was behind the other cloud providers on building new regions. </li>
<li> Amazon launches AWS Proton in <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/09/amazon-launches-aws-proton-in-general-availability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">general availability</a>. There are some super cool improvements that have been done to this.</li>
<li> Amazon EC2 now allows you to create crash-consistent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/06/amazon-ec2-allows-create-crash-consistent-amis-from-instances-multiple-amazon-ebs-volumes-without-rebooting-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Machine Images</a> (AMIs). This is one of our EC2 wish list items — it’s great to tick it off the list.</li>
<li> AWS announces per second billing for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/06/announcing-per-second-billing-for-ec2-windows-server-and-sql-server-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC2 Windows Server and SQL Server Instances</a>. It’s nice to only be billed for what you actually use.  </li>
<li> AWS removes NAT Gateway’s dependence on Internet Gateway <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/06/aws-removes-nat-gateways-dependence-on-internet-gateway-for-private-communications/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">for private communications</a>. This has been a big annoyance for a while so nice to see it sorted!<]]></description>

</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: So Many Faults </h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon is launching the AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) for controlled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fault-injection-simulator-use-controlled-experiments-to-boost-resilience/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fault experiments on AWS workloads</a>.

<li> Amazon announces <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-glacier-price-reduction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price reduction for S3 Glacier</a>. We can hear the cash registers ringing in the background.      </li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon and Microsoft are acting like children that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/16/aws_jedi_protest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">need to be separated</a>. </li>
<li> Infrastructure nerds are rejoicing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-liveblog-infrastructure-keynote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">at re:Invent</a>.</li>
<li> You can spend while you sleep <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/10/google_cloud_over_run/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">with Google</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Everyone&#8217;s Favorite Topic</h3>
<ul>
<li> A heavily redacted version of AWS&#8217;s latest protest against Microsoft and the JEDI contract <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/16/aws_jedi_protest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">has been unsealed</a>. Trump made them do it.</li>
<li> U.S. Treasury and Commerce Department communications were reportedly <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/u-s-treasury-commerce-depts-hacked-through-solarwinds-compromise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">compromised by a supply chain attack</a> on security vendor SolarWinds. Go hug a security team this week. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: The Presents Keep On Coming</h3>
<h3>re:Invent Continued</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS launches the VPC Reachability Analyzer to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-insights-analyzes-reachability-and-visibility-in-vpcs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">measure reachability</a> between two endpoints without sending any packets. Anything that makes life easier is a win. </li>
<li> The re:Invent infrastructure keynote lacked announcements but gives insight into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-liveblog-infrastructure-keynote/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">how AWS thinks about data centers</a>. Old school infrastructure nerds, take note of this one.</li>
<li> AWS announces the general availability of Amazon EMR on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-emr-on-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Elastic Kubernetes Service</a>. EMR fans will be super happy about this. </li>
<li> AWS has released an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/amazon-ec2-announces-spot-blueprints-an-infrastructure-code-template-generator-to-get-started-with-ec2-spot-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Infrastructure Code Template generator</a> to make it easy to start using Spot Instances.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Lucas (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryron01" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@ryron01</a>) fills in for Peter as we review the latest batch of cloud news. AWS re:Invent 2019 is just a month away and there’s no shortage of announcements this week either. </li>
</ul>
<p>This week’s highlights</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS re:Invent 2019</a> session catalog is live. If you haven’t gotten into the panels you want, you&#8217;ll have to get on a waitlist. We’re also considering a podcast meetup! Please let us know if you’d be up for that. Reach out on Twitter or through the <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/contact-us/">contact form</a>. </li>
<li>Look at migrating from Oracle. It may take some time and effort to accomplish, but the savings Amazon’s had are results that bear an attempt at repeating.</li>
<li>You might be in luck if you have an open-source project. AWS is offering promotional credits to promote certain open-source work.
Amazon completes massive migrations from Oracle After moving 75 petabytes of data involving 100+ teams, Amazon has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-consumer-business-just-turned-off-its-final-oracle-database/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">finished migrating</a> the last database of their first-party programs from Oracle to AWS services. The slashes in operational costs and latency may have the Amazon teams happy, but Oracle will definitely be watching to see if their other customers will be tempted to follow suit. A 90 percent reduction in cost would be an enticing prospect to switch providers of any service, and half the latency is nothing to sneeze at either.</p>
<p>Amazon looks to be taking some of those savings and turning them right back around into more projects. Of note, they will be offering <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">promotional credits</a> to those working on open-source projects, especially if you are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-sponsorship-of-the-rust-project/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">working in Rust</a>. If you manage to get a whole year of funding through Amazon that will mean more time working on what you really care about and less trying to keep the grants coming in every quarter or, worse, every month.</p>
<p>Rounding out AWS news, we discussed four other stories:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-firewall-manager-update-support-for-vpc-security-groups/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VPC security groups</a> come to Firewall Manager. Finally. You’d think this would be included day one, but at least it’s here now. Maybe soon it’ll be updated to include federated access?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">New M5n/R5n EC2 instances will offer up to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-m5n-and-r5n-instances-with-up-to-100-gbps-networking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">100 Gbps</a> networking speeds. If you need to move around larger sets for machine learning, for instance, the price is reasonable.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">EC2 instances will also be available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-bare-metal-arm-based-ec2-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Arm-based bare metal form</a>. The bare metal probably won’t grant much of an efficiency edge anymore, but hey, maybe it will help meet especially strict compliances.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, AWS releases OpenSearch and EKS Anywhere, Google Cloud is now available in the Toronto region, and Microsoft deals with two critical security issues. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS releases OpenSearch (previously Elasticsearch) and makes EKS Anywhere generally available — to those who run VMware. </li>
<li> Google Cloud opens a Toronto region, expanding its core Google portfolio into three new zones. How aboot that?</li>
<li> Security issues continue to plague Microsoft, with critical vulnerabilities exposed in both its ACI and OMI features. Hopefully new hire, Charlie Bell, can help them out. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<p>  “I hope that the reason [AWS is] integrating with VMware only is because they&#8217;re deeply integrating with that platform and they can spin up new VMs, deploy new infrastructure, and provide the scaling you need to make EKS Anywhere work the way it works in the cloud.”</p>
<p> “Everything now is driven by the cloud in a big way, where you pay by the drip. So now I need to make the drip as efficient as possible. And if I can give you dedicated silicon to do that, that&#8217;s the best thing for me. And so it&#8217;s quite interesting.”</p>
<h3>General News: Jump On It </h3>
<ul>
<li> The Cloud Pod sponsor, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/13/cloud-directory-service-jumpcloud-raises-159m-as-remote-work-booms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud, raises $159 million in its Series F round</a>, bringing its total funding to $350 million. Remote working has catalyzed growth for this cloud directory service, now valued at $2.56 billion. Take that, AD.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: New Features, Who Dis?  </h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elasticsearch-service-is-now-amazon-opensearch-service-and-supports-opensearch-10/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Elasticsearch is now OpenSearch</a>. In addition to the new name, AWS has also added a host of new features like advanced security, SQL query syntax, updated reporting capabilities, and more. Overall, we are super happy with this first release! </li>
<li> Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-anywhere-now-generally-available-to-create-and-manage-kubernetes-clusters-on-premises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EKS Anywhere is now generally available</a>… as long as you use it on top of VMware. EKS (almost) Anywhere helps users manage any Kubernetes cluster, and offers automation tooling for cluster lifecycle support. This comes two weeks late for Justin, who included it in his predictions draft. Bummer. </li>
<li> Livestreamers rejoice! AWS is launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-vt1-instances-for-live-multi-stream-video-transcoding/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC2 T1 instances for live multi-stream video transcoding</a>, which will provide resolution up to 4K Ultra HD. Using GPUs for graphics processing — what an idea!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Google Welcomes Toronto to the Family </h3>
<ul>
<li> In addition to giving users dedicated CPUs, GCP is now offering <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-always-on-cpu-allocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"]]></description>

<h3>Google: What’s Next?</h3>
<ul>
<li> The Google Cloud Next <a href="https://youtu.be/81y2EEjllcI" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">keynote address</a> was this week, and Jonathan has taken the win for our draft picks by predicting new collaborations and productivity tools in Google Meet. Congratulations, Jonathan!</li>
<li> Google launched the <a href="https://openusage.org/news/introducing-the-open-usage-commons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Open Usage Commons</a> framework to support Open Source development. Google has donated the ISTIO trademark to the Commons, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/google-says-trademarks-should-be-open-source-too-ibm-disagrees/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">upsetting IBM</a>.</li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> IBM is spinning off its infrastructure services business — the new public company will be called “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-divestiture-idUSKBN2BZ1OR?taid=60745e2bb509cb00014097ff&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kyndryl</a>.”</li>
<li> Teresa Carlson has left the AWS building. The AWS VP is <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/04/05/top-aws-executive-teresa-carlson-joins-splunk-president-chief-growth-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">headed to big-data analytics company Splunk Inc.</a> as its new chief growth officer. </li>
<li> Google’s like the cool kids who <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/startups/leaf-space-enabling-next-gen-satellites-on-google-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know how to party</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Eventual Degradation of Profits</h3>
<ul>
<li> IBM to name its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-divestiture-idUSKBN2BZ1OR?taid=60745e2bb509cb00014097ff&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">infrastructure services business “Kyndryl”</a>. We hope they didn’t spend a lot of money coming up with that name. </li>
<li> Top AWS executive Teresa Carlson joins Splunk as <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/04/05/top-aws-executive-teresa-carlson-joins-splunk-president-chief-growth-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">President and Chief Growth Officer</a>. We thought she might have been a candidate to succeed Andy Jassy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: 5G Not Included</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS formally launches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the OpenSearch project</a>. Seems like it’s listened to the open source feedback.    </li>
<li> Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling introduces Warm Pools to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-ec2-auto-scaling-introduces-warm-pools-accelerate-scale-out-while-saving-money/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">accelerate scale-out while saving money</a>. Please don’t let Andy name anything.</li>
<li> AWS and Verizon team up to provide <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/04/05/aws-verizon-team-provide-5g-powered-edge-computing-infrastructure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5G-powered edge computing infrastructure</a>. Justin got his COVID-19 vaccination and was disappointed it didn’t come with 5G.   </li>
<li> Amazon Redshift now supports data sharing when <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-redshift-supports-data-sharing-producer-clusters-paused/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">producer clusters are paused</a>. We wonder what underlying tech made this possible? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Excel at No Code</h3>
<ul>
<li> Leaf Space enables <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/startups/leaf-space-enabling-next-gen-satellites-on-google-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next-gen satellites on Google Cloud</a>. This fills a very obvious gap in the market and is pretty cool. </li>
<li> Google introduces a new blog series: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/ciso-perspectives-april-202]]></description>

<ul>

<h3>General News: [Upgrade to Premium for Full Segment Title]</h3>
<ul>
<li> GitHub has switched to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/github-is-now-free-for-all-teams/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">freemium business model</a> — core features will be free to all users, and premium features like Security Assertion Markup Language will require a paid plan.

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Our first 2020 prediction comes true in a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/ibm-power-systems-now-available-on-google-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft/IBM team-up</a>.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Matters of National Security</h3>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/01/14/aws-seeks-temporary-block-pentagons-10b-jedi-contract-microsoft/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">going to court</a> over allegations that the $10 billion JEDI contract was awarded to Microsoft due to improper pressure from the president as part of his personal issues with Amazon CEO Jeffrey Bezos. Expect the temporary restraining order to be granted or denied on February 11. Amazon may try to drag out proceedings until after the election — and a more favorable administration.</p>
<p>For those of you running Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016, be sure to grab the new patch advised by Microsoft and the National Security Agency. The patch solves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/microsoft-critical-certificates-bug/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a vulnerability</a> that was found in a decades-old component called CryptoAPI, and would allow an attacker to copy the digital signature of legitimate software.</p>
<h3>Amazon Web Services — Seven Short Sweet Stories</h3>
<p>Though AWS may be hoping to stall the JEDI contract, business as usual shows no sign of slowing. Here are the seven AWS stories we talked about this week:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can now go to Github for the public roadmap of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/01/aws-elastic-beanstalk-launches-public-roadmap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a> and voice any of your input.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">UK Home Office (think Department of Homeland Security) has announced they’ll <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/10/home_office_hands_aws_100m_for_public_cloud_services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">renew their public cloud services deal</a> with AWS for another <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/10/home_office_hands_aws_100m_for_public_cloud_services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">£100</a> million over four more years. To put that in context, it’s 0.13 percent the size of JEDI.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Ariel Kelman has left to join Oracle, and in his absence, AWS is taking the opportunity to <a href="https://siliconang]]></description>

<li> Microsoft, AWS and others boast of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2wfm94n8es9vvhz/Microsoft%2C%20AWS%2C%20Others%20Boast%20of%20%E2%80%98Exclusive%E2%80%99%20Cloud%20Customers%20Who%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Information.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">exclusive cloud customers</a> that aren’t actually exclusive to them. At the end of the day, being “all in” is a gimmick. </li>
<li> Palo Alto Networks, Inc. announced it’s adding <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/10/13/palo-alto-networks-beefs-multicloud-security-platform-prisma-cloud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">four new cloud security modules</a> to Prisma Cloud.

<h3>Amazon Web Services: Strangely Quiet</h3>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, with a couple of no-shows, Justin and Ryan’s Happy Hour includes returning guests Matthew Kohn and Sara Tumberella. Also, the team is curious to see what’s going to change at AWS with its new CEO.             </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon has finally launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/opensearch-1-0-launches/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenSearch 1.0</a>. They’re hoping to make the transition to as simple as possible for open-source Elasticsearch users.</li>
<li> AWS customers can now pre-pay for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/aws-allows-customers-pay-their-usage-in-advance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">their usage</a>. This will allow customers to pay future invoices automatically. </li>
<li> Google announced the general availability of its new <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-certificate-authority-service-is-now-ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Certificate Authority Service (CAS)</a>. It hopes the service will help address the increased need for digital certificates.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I&#8217;m curious to see if you can do things like optimization, where you can reference a security group rule many times across multiple security groups. [You could] simplify a lot of your ecosystem by having maybe a catalog of rules that you apply selectively.”</li>
<li> “I still haven&#8217;t seen much talk about what they&#8217;re doing with Beats, and if they&#8217;re going to fork Beats as well. Initially, they weren’t going to, but then it sounded like Elasticsearch basically pulled the rug out from under them on that too. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see that also get forked at some point in the future as well.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Red Tape
</h3>
<ul>
<li> New AWS CEO Adam Selipsky faces <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/aws-new-ceo-faces-a-fresh-challenge-bureaucracy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bureaucracy challenges</a>. It will be interesting to see what he keeps and what he changes.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Security: Ryan’s Going to Space </h3>
<ul>
<li> Research suggests security tools are fighting for attention, and there’s a <a href="https://beta.darkreading.com/application-security/tool-sprawl-false-positives-hold-security-teams-back" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">rise in false-positive alerts</a>. When companies want the latest and greatest security applications, they often end up competing with each other, and it makes troubleshooting difficult.       </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Setting Fire to Dumpsters  </h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/easily-manage-security-group-rules-with-the-new-security-group-rule-id/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VPC security group rule IDs</a>. We’re curious to dig into the details: for example, will it allow users to reference one security group rule across multiple security groups?     </li>
<li> AWS launches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/opensearch-1-0-launches/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenSearch 1.0</a>. We get the impression AWS is handling this project differently, by really i]]></description>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> We crown the winner of this year’s AWS Summit Draft Picks!</li>
<li> Amazon and Microsoft keep <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/05/08/amazon-files-new-protest-fatally-flawed-jedi-cloud-computing-contract-award/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">slinging blog posts</a> over JEDI.</li>
<li> We’re all just trying to stay sane, honestly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS Summit: Draft Picks</h3>
<ul>
<li> While it wasn’t a particularly accurate set of predictions this year (with no honorable mentions scoring and even the tiebreaker non-functional), Justin managed to squeak out a win by correctly predicting a price cut in EC2, S3, or Networking and the Covid Crazy Growth Numbers. Jonathan scored the only other point with his prediction of improved DLP Tools for S3.</li>
<li> Amazon Macie <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-enhanced-amazon-macie-now-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">simplified</a> its pricing plan and dramatically reduced costs. Is the 80% price cut the new way of announcing a product is generally available?</li>
<li> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-price-reduction-for-ec2-instance-saving-plans-and-standard-reserved-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cut prices</a> across all regions for Standard Reserved Instances and EC2 Instance Saving Plans. </li>
<li> Inter-Region Data Transfer prices have been <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-inter-region-data-transfer-dtir-price-reduction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reduced</a> for data coming out of São Paulo, Bahrain, Cape Town and Sydney.</li>

Microsoft and Amazon continue to snip at each other in public blog posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>COVID-19</p>
<ul>
<li> Amazon will allow non-warehouse employees to<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-will-let-employees-work-home-least-early-october-new-guidelines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> work from home</a> for at least five months.

<h3>AWS</h3>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Jonathan reveals his love for “Twilight.” Plus GCP kicks off Google Cloud Next and announces Google Distributed Cloud, and Azure admits to a major DDoS attack. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> After a few awkward keynotes, Google Cloud Next kicks off days one and two, highlighting new features and announcing Google’s $10 billion investment in cybersecurity advancements.</li>
<li> At Google Cloud Next, GCP announced the Google Distributed Cloud: A network of hardware and software to help organizations improve cloud strategies. </li>
<li> After tooting its horn for reduced DDoS attacks in 2021, Azure reveals details about the largest DDoS attack in its history. This 2.4 terabits/second attack was launched in late August against an Azure customer in Europe. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “It is kind of crazy, because [Google Distributed Cloud] is an open source project that&#8217;s basically how to run Google Cloud in your own data center. It&#8217;s probably a smart risk, because I do believe workloads will just eventually end up on Google Cloud.”</li>
<li> “The tools have the functionality built in, but unless you&#8217;re offering that as a service to your end users … and thinking about the holistic management of the settings, the deployment and the full lifecycle of those things, it&#8217;s the difference between enabling your business to be secure and just shooting it in the foot.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Keeping Quiet This Week for Google Cloud Next</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/amazon-fraud-detector-event-datasets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Fraud Detector can now store event datasets</a> and use this historical data to boost performance for ML models — all at a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/aws-price-reduction-amazon-fraud-detector/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">56% reduction in price</a>.  </li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/aws-console-mobile-amazon-elastic-container-service/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Console Mobile Application has (finally) added ECS</a>, which will allow users to view and manage a select set of resources to support incident responses from their devices. Clearly someone at AWS listens to TCP and has heard Justin’s many complaints about this. </li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-the-general-availability-of-cdk8s-and-support-for-go/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CDK8s (say that five times fast) is now generally available</a> and supports the Go programming language. Using CDK8s, you can define your K8 applications and apply K8 YAML to any cluster. </li>
<li> Tired of accidentally deleting your backup with your cloud formation stack? The newly released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/aws-backup-backup-protection-aws-backup-vault-lock/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Backup Vault Lock</a> solves this problem by using safeguards to ensure users store their backups using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. </li>
</ul>

	<title>130: The Cloud Pod has how many unattended Google projects?</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, it’s been an interesting few days in the cloud, so the team members have made themselves comfortable with plenty of adult beverages to keep them going. Also, Elastic has forked everyone with its latest Elasticsearch move.                </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Elastic has modified the Elasticsearch Python client <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/09/elasticsearch_python_client_change/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">so it won’t work with forked versions</a>, including the relatively recently released OpenSearch 1.0.</li>
<li> AWS CloudWatch Synthetics now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/08/amazon-cloudwatch-synthetics-supports-visual-monitoring/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supports visual monitoring</a>. Customers with web apps can see defects that can’t be scripted but would be visible to end users.</li>
<li> Google introduces the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-launches-unattended-project-recommender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unattended Project Recommender</a>. ​​It uses machine learning to identify projects that have likely been abandoned and forgotten about, so you can cull them from the cloud. </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “People were originally attracted to Elasticsearch because it was an open source project. So this [amending the Elasticsearch Python client] is taking away one of the main reasons they were able to acquire the users they did. I don&#8217;t get the strategy, unless they&#8217;re pulling a ripcord right now, because they&#8217;re bleeding.”</li>
<li> “I know a lot of companies are moving their services into the cloud, and a lot of security engineers are restricting outbound access, or tightly controlling egress. These things [Google’s Private Service Connect] have to happen — these things are absolutely needed — to keep them secure, and allow those companies to sell their services. Good catch-up feature.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: We’re Not Angry Just Disappointed</h3>
<ul>
<li> Elastic amends Elasticsearch Python client so it <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/09/elasticsearch_python_client_change/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">won&#8217;t work with forked versions</a> — and proves it knows how unpopular this is by blocking GitHub comments. This is forcing people to choose sides, and is a really disappointing move.  </li>
<li> AWS details its commitment to keeping OpenSearch and Elasticsearch <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/keeping-clients-of-opensearch-and-elasticsearch-compatible-with-open-source/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">compatible with open source</a>. Elastic has managed the impossible: it’s made AWS look like the good guys.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Unbreaking The Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon’s senior cloud leader Charlie Bell is leaving the company <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-senior-cloud-exec-charlie-bell-leaving-company-23-years/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">after more than 23 years</a>. Knowing how fast AWS moves, we feel tired just thinking about working there that long.  </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, The Team are on the brink and three more months of the pandemic will likely push the podcast over the edge into an abyss of garble that no one can understand. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon has a gender reveal party and introduces its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/02/introducing-amazon-cloudfront-security-savings-bundle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">latest bundle of joy</a>.</li>
<li> Google is eating croissants <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/googles-dunant-subsea-cable-is-now-ready-for-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for breakfast</a>.</li>
<li> Azure is dangling a pair of juicy fruits <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-defender-for-app-service-introduces-dangling-dns-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in front of us</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow Up: The Mad Men Are Back</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Amazon announces its “Other” business segment, which consists mostly of its advertising business, has <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/advertising-surge-lifts-amazons-segment-past-subscription-business-pace-rival-aws/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">surpassed its “subscription services” segment</a>. There’s speculation that Andy Jassy might split Amazon&#8217;s advertising business out once he becomes CEO. </li>
</ul>
<p>General News: Rolls Right Off The Tongue</p>
<ul>
<li> Vantage, an AWS Console alternative, has <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/blog/vantage-has-acquired-ec2instances-info" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acquired ec2instances.info</a>. They better not mess it up!  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Undoing Your Hard Work</h3>
<ul>
<li> New Amazon Elastic Block Store Local Snapshots on AWS Outposts makes it easier to meet <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-elastic-block-store-local-snapshots-on-aws-outposts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data residency and local backup requirements</a>. It’s like playing a video game and building up your weapons, only to start from scratch when you move regions. </li>
<li> Amazon introduces CloudFront <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/02/introducing-amazon-cloudfront-security-savings-bundle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Security Savings Bundle</a>. We appreciate the savings, but not sure about the bundle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Our Buzzword Bingo Is On Point</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google launches improved troubleshooting with Cloud Spanner <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/seeing-into-the-performance-of-cloud-native-database-spanner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introspection capabilities</a>. We love these types of tools, except if they’re on SQL Server.</li>

<li> Registration for Amazon Re:Mars 2020 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/registration-for-amazon-remars-2020-is-open-%F0%9F%8E%89/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">is now open</a>! Academics can use code ACAD20REMARS for a discount.</li>

<li> We tried out a new format for our lightning round!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: To Infinity and Beyond</h3>
<p> Registration is open for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/registration-for-amazon-remars-2020-is-open-%F0%9F%8E%89/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Re:Mars 2020</a> robotics and technology conference running June 16-19 in Las Vegas. Tickets cost $1,999, but astronauts get in free! Academics and students registering with a .edu email address can use the discount code ACAD20REMARS if a couple grand is too pricey.</p>

If you’ve got only a few VPCs, you might have the right use case for this.</p>

<h3>JEDI: Things Are Not Going Well</h3>

<h3>General News: What? Amazon is Litigious? No&#8230;</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon is <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-sues-former-aws-marketing-vp-brian-hall-accepts-google-cloud-job/?mc_cid=4d4e79297b&amp;mc_eid=04fad859c0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">suing</a> their former vice president of marketing Brian Hall over the breach of his non-compete agreement after taking a position with Google Cloud.

Well, it’s cheaper than the Intel counterpart.</li>
<li> EC2 G4dn bare metal instances are now available with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/announcing-general-availability-amazon-ec2-g4dn-bare-metal-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">up to eight NVIDIA T4 GPUs</a>.

<li> Profits of The Cloud Pod’s <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/shop/">sticker sales</a> will be donated to charity.</li>
<li> DeepComposer is now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepcomposer-now-generally-available-with-new-features/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">generally available</a>.</li>
<li> You can play around with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/march-madness-simulations-with-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March Madness simulations</a> in BigQuery.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: The Cloud Pod Tackles COVID-19</h3>
<p> We’re donating profits of our <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/shop/">sticker sales</a> to the John Hopkins University COVID-19 Research Response Program through July 1, 2020.</p>
<h3> AWS: Staying Productive</h3>
<p> The Amazon CloudWatch Contributor <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplified-time-series-analysis-with-amazon-cloudwatch-contributor-insights/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Insights feature</a>, which gives users an overview of their operational problems, is now generally available. CloudWatch Contributor Insights is also generally available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-contributor-insights-for-dynamodb-now-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">for DynamoDB</a>, though it is 50 percent more expensive per million log events than Insights not for DynamoDB. You can build some neat automation around this.</p>
<p> Back in <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/reinvent-2019-we-really-should-have-gone-back-to-the-room-episode-51/">Episode 51</a>, we covered the new instances with ra3.16xlarge nodes, and now Amazon is adding instances <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-update-ra3-4xlarge-instances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">with ra3.4xlarge nodes</a>, which lack the excess power of ra3.16xlarge. At a quarter of the price of the larger larges, that’s some considerable savings.</p>
<p> Amazon Redshift now features <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-redshift-now-supports-changing-node-types-within-minutes-with-elastic-resize/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elastic resize</a>, allowing users to change node types within minutes. This will be helpful if you want to make the move to those cheaper instances.</p>
<p> If you’re looking for something fun while sheltering in place, you may be pleased to hear that AWS DeepComposer is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepcomposer-now-generally-available-with-new-features/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a> (and with new features!) You can buy an Amazon keyboard for $99 or a generic for $50.</p>
<p> Amazon RDS for SQL Server <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-rds-for-sql-server-now-supports-in-region-read-replicas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now supports</a> In-Region Read Replicas on SQL Server Enterprise Edition in the Multi-AZ config with Always On Availability. Careful though, you can really rack up a bill this way if you’re careless.</p>
<p> Amazon announced that Amazon Elastic File System has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-elastic-file-system-announces-increase-in-read-operations-for-general-purpose-file-systems/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">quintupled its speed</a> for General Purpose mode file systems to 35,000 read ]]></description>

<h3>Amazon Web Services: Error 404 </h3>
<p> Amazon explains the Thanksgiving Kinesis outage that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/11201/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">occurred in North East Virginia</a>. We feel bad for the Ops team that had to support this. </p>

<li> Amazon adds stronger Read-After-Write <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">consistency to S3</a>. A really fantastic technical feat.   </li>

<h2>AWS Draft — and the Winner is… </h2>
<p>On <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/twas-the-night-before-reinvent-ep-49/">episode 49</a>, we drafted each of our top three picks for what we thought would be announced at Re:Invent. It’s a three-way tie for first! Each one of us correctly guessed one of our three picks, and nobody guessed that <a href="http://www.andersonpaak.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anderson .Paak</a> would make a musical appearance, leaving the tie unbroken. (Peter predicted that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBX7lPk5qmA" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Formula 1 racing</a> would be included, but it was a runner-up choice and goes uncounted.)</p>
<p>Moving on to Re:Invent, we cover the announcements day-by-day:</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;">Toys and Security</h3>
<p>AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepcomposer-compose-music-with-generative-machine-learning-models/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DeepComposer</a>, the world’s first machine learning enabled keyboard. The 32-key, 2-octave keyboard is designed to help developers to get hands-on with AI. You can train the program to generate compositions based on musical genres, but don’t expect any compelling vocals from it yet, though. Check out the announcement for sample selections. For only $99 you will be able to buy a MIDI keyboard (worth about $50) with the AWS logo on </p>

<li> Jeff Bezos is joining the first human flight <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bezos-will-blast-himself-into-space" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">to space with his company Blue Origin</a>. This is super risky, even if he’s no longer CEO. </li>

	<title>Solutions Architect To SADA CTO: Miles Ward on how and why the Google Cloud has the edge</title>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=1283</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of TCP Talks, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Miles Ward, the founder of the Google Cloud’s Solutions Architecture practice. Currently, Miles leads the cloud strategy and solutions capabilities as the Chief Technology Officer for consulting and IT services company <a href="https://sada.com/about/company-overview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SADA</a>.</p>
<p>Startups have helped increase the popularity of open source products among enterprise businesses. Changing systems can be a struggle for larger, more traditional companies. But legacy businesses also want to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time, which requires shedding clunky, legacy systems. </p>
<p>“Those building blocks make it so that companies operate at a certain rate of change. And I know zero companies asking me to slow down their rate of change,” he notes. </p>
<p>The evolution of product compatibility is also discussed.  Product sellers need to help customers understand how much of their system fits and how much doesn’t fit in one solution compared to another, Miles says. Customers need to have a clear understanding of what’s involved and how much work it’s going to be.  </p>
<p>In addition, Miles shares his thoughts on the role of the CTO as well as the benefits of rebranding a product everybody hates.</p>
<h2>Featured Guest</h2>
<p> Name: <a href="https://sada.com/about/leadership-team/miles-ward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Miles Ward</a></p>
<p> What he does: As CTO of SADA, Miles leads the cloud strategy and solutions capabilities. His remit includes delivering next-generation solutions to challenges in big data and analytics, application migration, infrastructure automation, and cost optimization; and engaging with customers on their most complex and ambitious plans around Google Cloud. </p>
<p> Key quote: “There used to be big crunchy legacy impediments to adoption&#8230; But it&#8217;s 2021 — live in the future, that shit works. Now it&#8217;s more about making it easy enough and predictable enough to consume that folks can unlock the business justification.” </p>
<p> Where to find him: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milesward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/milesward" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li> Gone are the days when products from different technology providers, like Oracle or SAP, couldn’t work together to solve a customer problem. These days, companies need to make products easy and predictable enough so customers can unlock the business justification straight away.</li>
<li> For Google Cloud, the next phase of growth will require investment in higher-level relationships with customers. Miles references his experience with current Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian (TK).   </li>
<li>“TK is super focused about spending the majority of his time face to face with customers,” he says. “He&#8217;s not doing it to be a glad-hand, he&#8217;s deal making and proposal pushing and thinking through the machinery of how to build higher level relationships.” </li>
<li> There’s a huge opportunity to help the “the real world divisions inside of real world businesses”  — not just serve the IT department.</li>
<li>Miles says, “I think there&#8217;s a bunch of cloud providers that are working really hard now to facilitate the plumbing and governance and oversight and security controls and operational management of what is — not a hybrid between their data center, and a cloud — a hybrid between their SaaS fleet and the couple of things they still need to run on their own.”</li>
<li> Worried about leveraging a Google solution and then having them pull the plug on it? Miles doesn’t think you should be too concerned about deprecation. </li>
<li>“I think they have heard this feedback really loud and clear,” he says.  “There&#8217;s a whole bunch of people that have made it really obvious that if ]]></description>

<ul>
<li> The third annual AWS Storage Day <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-storage-day-2021/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">brought a few presents</a>, including new features for files and transfers.</li>

<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li>  “I assume this is all built natively on top of AWS, and they are managing the service for you on EC2. If that&#8217;s the case, I believe this is the first of this type that AWS has offered. We&#8217;ve talked about Google partnering with people to operate appliances on your own VPCs, same as Azure. So this is probably the first of many partner integrations.”</li>
<li> “I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s [Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points] they wanted, but I think at these prices, they definitely didn&#8217;t want it. If the price was more attractive or if it was simpler to process and calculate — more predictable — I think people would potentially be excited about this.”</li>

	<title>125: JEDI is Dead, and the Cloud Pod Launches Bottlerockets in Celebration</title>
	<link>https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/125-jedi/</link>
	<pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=1416</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, Ryan was busy buying stuff on Amazon Prime Day and didn’t want to talk about JEDI, so he arrived late to the recording. Also, long-time sponsor of The Cloud Pod, Foghorn Consulting, has been acquired by Evoque, so the team grilled Peter for the juicy details.            </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> The $10 billion JEDI cloud contract has been canceled <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">by the Pentagon</a>. In its place, the DOD announced a new multi-vendor contract known as the “Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability.”  </li>
<li> Evoque Data Center Solutions has acquired cloud engineering experts <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/evoque-data-center-solutions-acquires-123000713.html?guccounter=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Foghorn Consulting</a>. This is a key part of the company’s Multi-Generational Infrastructure (MGI) strategy, which it announced the same day as the acquisition.  </li>
<li> AWS released some incredible numbers from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2021-two-chart-topping-days/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Prime Day</a>. Jeff Barr gives his annual take on how AWS performed and the record-setting event.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “The Pentagon has called off the $10 billion cloud contract [JEDI]. It was being dragged through the courts by Amazon and Microsoft, and this is sort of an admission that the Pentagon didn&#8217;t want Donald Trump to get subpoenaed and testify on what his involvement was in the whole contract.”</li>
<li> “This is a big problem that almost every business has: how do you stop a deployment, especially a large deployment? Typically, we throw people at it, and we have them watch millions of dashboards, and hopefully, they catch it. But usually, it&#8217;s a problem somewhere that&#8217;s exposed to the customer that triggers that. So if we can have more tools like Gandalf that detect problems earlier, it’s great.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Some People Can’t Take a Joke</h3>
<ul>
<li> Evoque Data Center Solutions <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/evoque-data-center-solutions-acquires-123000713.html?guccounter=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">acquires Foghorn Consulting</a>. Congratulations to Peter on this exciting news! </li>
<li> The AWS Infinidash story has taken on <a href="https://twitter.com/jna_sh/status/1410178986978775040" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a life of its own</a>. What started as a joke has led to backlash from the community complaining about it being a form of technology gatekeeping. </li>
</ul>
<h3>JEDI: We’re Not Talking About This Anymore</h3>
<ul>
<li> The Pentagon has canceled the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$10 billion JEDI cloud contract</a>. It’s not really dead, they&#8217;ve just turned it into a joint multi-cloud offering, which is what we said they should do six months ago.  </li>

<h3>Amazon Web Services (AWS) at the Consumer Electronics Show 2020 — Cars and CAs</h3>
<p>Those attending the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week saw Amazon show off the practical uses of AWS technology and machine learning at their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-at-ces-2020-connectivity-mobility/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">automotive exhibit</a>. The exhibit includes an array of demonstrations from an in-vehicle digital assistant to car-to-home integrations to a fleet of autonomous cars in China. We’d like to see this sort of in-vehicle technology have constant cloud connectivity, where software updates can continue to be pushed out.</p>
<p>And speaking of updates, you may have already seen a notification or email for AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/urgent-important-rotate-your-amazon-rds-aurora-and-documentdb-certificates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">upcoming 2019 certificate authority</a>. From the article:</p>
<p>“If you are using Amazon Aurora, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), or Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) and are taking advantage of SSL/TLS certificate validation when you connect to your database instances, you need to download &amp; install a fresh certificate, rotate the certificate authority (CA) for the instances, and then reboot the instances.” -Jeff Barr</p>
<h3>Yeah, it’s a chore and it sucks to do, but if you use it and you don’t update your CA, you’ll have an outage. Is doing this once every five years really so bad?</h3>
<p>Lastly, in all AWS regions except China, you can now use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/01/aws-privatelink-supports-private-dns-names-internal-3rd-party-services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Private DNS names</a> to access your AWS PrivateLink based services. We’re happy to see it.</p>
<h3>Azure Recaps Cost Management for 2019</h3>
<p>While Azure’s been quiet since Christmas, their cost management program manager published an article this week <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cost-management-2019-year-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recapping</a> the tools they’ve released over the last year to help you monitor a]]></description>

	<title>138: Cloud Pod productivity is way up thanks to the Facebook outage</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team is running at half-duplex without Peter and Ryan. Plus Cloudflare R2 is here, Facebook died for a day, and AWS releases Cloud Control Plane. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Cloudflare’s new R2 service is making waves in the cloud object storage space, offering incentives like no egress fees and lower rates than its competitors. </li>
<li> Influencers, boomers and bored teenagers collectively screamed on October 4th as Facebook and its associated apps experienced an unprecedented six-hour outage. </li>
<li> AWS Cloud Control Plane offers developers an easier way to manage their third-party and AWS services with a new set of common APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “The bigger impact is actually WhatsApp, because for a large portion of the world, Whatsapp is the primary method of communication. If you go … to different countries overseas … everyone&#8217;s on WhatsApp. Everybody. So to not have that communication is a huge loss. And you have to wonder, does Facebook need to think about diversifying their backend in some way? Should all of their DNS be inside Facebook?” </li>
<li> “[AWS Cloud Control API] is probably going to be a requirement for any new services that launch in AWS … which means that we will no longer be waiting weeks or months for new services to be available in CloudFormation.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: The day that Facebook died (for six hours)</h3>
<ul>
<li> Cloudflare is getting into the cloud object storage market with its <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/09/28/cloudflare-targets-cloud-object-storage-market-new-r2-service/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new, competitively-priced R2 Service</a>. Unlike other storage services, Cloudflare is nixing the dreaded egress cost, and will charge 10% less than AWS, its largest competitor. </li>
<li> Facebook is having a rough week. On October 4th — the day before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a former employee testified</a> to Congress about the social media giant’s negative impacts — Facebook accidentally <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unpublished itself and its affiliated apps for around six hours</a>. A seemingly routine update caused issues with its BGP routes: <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Read the company’s account of events here</a>.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: On a mission to control the cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li> In a rush to release before the next AWS summit, <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-managed-service" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is now generally available</a>. With Prometheus, users can easily monitor their containerized apps at scale, and new features like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-managed-service-for-prometheus-is-now-generally-available-with-alert-manager-and-ruler/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">alert manager and ruler</a> let users integrate SNS with various destinations.</]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team is back in full force and some are sporting fresh tan lines. Also, it’s earnings season, so get ready for some big numbers — as well as some losses.               </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS is finally killing off <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-classic-is-retiring-heres-how-to-prepare/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC2-Classic</a>. EC2 was launched in 2006, with one instance type (m1.small), security groups, and the US-EAST-1 Region. </li>
<li> The 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services is out, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-named-as-a-leader-for-the-11th-consecutive-year-in-2021-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-infrastructure-platform-services-cips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-cloud-a-leader-in-2021-gartner-iaas-mq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/public-cloud-iaas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft and Oracle</a> have all made it. Although some scraped in by the skin of their teeth.</li>
<li> Get consistent Kubernetes definitions with the new <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/anthos-config-management-config-controller-available-on-gke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthos Config Management feature</a>. The Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) helps users define and update resources with minimal effort on their part.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li> “I would say Google&#8217;s getting market share because they are able to leapfrog everyone else on Kubernetes, big data, and machine learning.”</li>
<li> “Considering all the different vendors that are involved in a hospital, just being able to have a standard data format with FHIR is huge. And they also now power that with the cloud. There are lots of really interesting use cases that get unlocked with this [Azure Healthcare APIs] solution.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Earn Baby Earn</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google’s parent company, Alphabet, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/alphabet-googl-earnings-q2-2021.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">crushed earnings expectations</a>. It still lost a lot, though. Increasing the price of YouTube TV could have limited the damage.</li>
<li> Microsoft&#8217;s revenue is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-msft-earnings-q4-2021.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">up 21% overall</a>. Azure’s revenue doubled, which is nuts. </li>
<li> Amazon’s revenue is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/amazon-amzn-earnings-q2-2021.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">up 27% overall</a> — but that’s <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-second-quarter-results-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">down from the 41% year-on-year increase</a> the company saw in Q2 of 2020. It’s starting to see post-COVID-19 corrections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Not Fit for Consumption</h3>

<li> AWS named as a Leader for the 11th consecutive year in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-named-as-a-leader-for-the-11th-consecutive-year-in-2021-gartner]]></description>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>

<h3>General: Growth Mindsets</h3>
<ul>
<li> For the first time in its 16 years as a public company, Alphabet’s quarterly sales <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/30/alphabet-revenue-dropped-in-q2-2020-the-first-decline-since-going-public/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">have dropped</a>. This is of course due to pandemic-related macroeconomic effects. It will be interesting to see if the ad revenue business model is changed long-term.</li>
<li> Despite being less than anytime in the last two years, Amazon reported AWS revenue <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/30/amazon-earnings-q2-2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">up 29%</a>. The retail end of Amazon is faring even better, with sales up 43% in North America.</li>
</ul>
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google Cloud AI and Harvard Global Health Institute have partnered to create the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-is-releasing-the-covid-19-public-forecasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Public Forecasts</a> model. You can query the forecasts for free in BigQuery or download as CSV.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AWS: Accepting Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li> Anomaly and threat detection for Amazon Simple Storage Service is coming to Amazon GuardDuty at an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-using-amazon-guardduty-to-protect-your-s3-buckets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">80% discount</a>. You can get a 30 day free trial of the improved and affordable service even on accounts already enabling GuardDuty.</li>
<li> The new AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-the-new-aws-community-builders-program/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Community Builders Program</a> is now open for anyone (to apply to). If you’re as interested as we are, be sure to sign up before September 15.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Your hosts are joined again by Ryan Lucas (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryron01" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@ryron01</a>) who is filling in for Peter as we recap the week in cloud.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> It’s earnings season as the top dogs <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-earnings-q2-2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">show</a> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/02/03/google-cloud-revenue-grows-53-not-enough-reverse-disappointing-quarter/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">their</a> <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-stock-soars-tech-giant-crushes-holiday-quarter-expectations-87-4b-revenue/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">growth</a>.</li>
<li> Azure gets back in the headlines with a bold but <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/faster-and-cheaper-sql-on-azure-continues-to-outshine-aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contested study</a>.</li>
<li> Google fulfills an old TCP prediction with reports of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/report-google-planning-tenth-messaging-app-this-ones-another-slack-clone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unified service</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Certificates of Doom Update</h3>
<p> Amazon has given customers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-rds-customers-update-your-ssl-tls-certificates-by-february-5-2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">an extension</a> until March 5, 2020 to rotate their SSL/TLS certificates. Previously, rebooting or manually changing a relational database service (RDS) instance would automatically switch to the new certificate authority, even if the customer didn’t have their application ready to do so.</p>
<h3>IBM Changes Leadership</h3>
<p> Speaking of new authorities, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/arvind-krishna-will-replace-ginni-rometty-as-ibm-ceo-in-april/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">major changes</a> are coming to IBM. Arvind Krishna will replace current CEO Ginni Rometty on April 6 and current Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst will become president. Hopefully the changes in leadership and the acquisition of Red Hat will be what IBM needs to turn around what’s been a <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/ibms-lost-decade/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">rough decade</a> for the tech giant.</p>
<h3>Earnings Season</h3>
<p> It’s that time of the year where financial analysts are breaking out the line graphs to show investors just how much their holdings are growing. Let’s see what the quarterly reports had to say this time around:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-earnings-q2-2020/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> saw a rebound from slowing cloud growth last quarter with Azure up 62 percent, Surface up 6 percent, and LinkedIn up 24 percent.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/02/03/google-cloud-revenue-grows-53-not-enough-reverse-disappointing-quarter/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> growth was strong enough for the company to brag, but still lags behind AWS, Azure and even Google’s own YouTube.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This interview is part of a paid sponsorship between Open Raven and The Cloud Pod. </em></p>
<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Mark Curphey, Chief Product Office and Co-Founder of <a href="https://openraven.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Open Raven</a>, a fully integrated platform for security and privacy workflows.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; text-decoration: none;">Featured Guest</h3>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Mark Curphey</p>
<p><strong>What he does:</strong> Mark is Chief Product Officer and Co-Founder of <a href="https://openraven.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Open Raven</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where to find him:</strong> <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/curphey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/curphey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p>
<p>Listen to Mark discuss the Open Raven strategy for protecting your data, the use of serverless workflows to scale to enormous workloads. Protecting your data and ensuring compliance using the Open Policy Agent – and more.</p>
<h3>Key Points</h3>
<h2><strong>Discover – Classify – Monitor – Protect</strong></h2>
<p>“The cloud has moved in incredibly fast; security has been moved off to the side and as a result companies don’t know where their data is, breaches are happening constantly, and these are the big things that get companies in the press.”</p>
<h3><strong>Macie</strong></h3>
<p>“Every single customer that we spoke to in the early stages said, a) It doesn&#8217;t work b) It&#8217;s ridiculously expensive, and c) It&#8217;s only on s3 buckets. Well, whilst The Register is always reporting breaches of S3 buckets, my customer data is in RDS! That&#8217;s a real piece of the problem for me; sure, it&#8217;s popular, but I shouldn&#8217;t just be thinking about trying to protect myself from getting on The Register.”</p>
<p>Part of the challenge is that data is not one thing&#8230; I may have a name, I may have an address, I may have a card number. There are all sorts of different parameters, and the data could be stored in multiple ways. So you have the concept of like data adjacency; If I have a CCV number, and expiry date and name associated to it that might be something which is real.</p>
<p>With Macie, even if you just use the straight matching techniques, you don&#8217;t have control over the adjacency thing, so that&#8217;s why a lot of the basic trivial cases get completely missed.</p>
<h3><strong>Security at the edge?</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;If you are protecting data in the cloud, you have to wire the tools into the cloud to understand which IAM has access, which routes, which security groups can give you access? That’s the only way to understand the context to protect it. You can&#8217;t do it in some sort of edge device.&#8221;</p>
<h3> <strong>Getting started with Open Raven</strong></h3>
<p>Visit <a href="https://openraven.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">openraven.com</a> to get a 15 day trial. Spin up a SaaS instance and go play.</p>
<p>“We already think we&#8217;re a better choice than Macie, but don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the end goal. Come partner with us, work with us on the end goal, because those are things that we love; solving massive, complex, and interesting problems.”</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon is on a mission to replace humans so we can go <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/24/amazon-launches-computer-vision-service-to-detect-defects-in-manufactured-products/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">on holiday permanently</a>. </li>
<li> Google is a bit early with the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-risk-protection-program-now-in-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April Fools’ joke</a>.</li>
<li> Azure is, much to our surprise, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/02/24/new-industry-clouds-offer-launchpad-for-innovation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ahead of everyone else for once</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Battle Bots</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon announces Alexa Conversations is now generally available for <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/01/amazon-makes-alexa-conversations-generally-available-to-developers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">voice app development</a>. We’re still a bit disappointed in her voice — it would be nice to hear something a bit more natural.   </li>
<li> Amazon launches computer vision service to detect <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/24/amazon-launches-computer-vision-service-to-detect-defects-in-manufactured-products/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">defects in manufactured products</a>. Soon we’ll just be sitting around eating bon bons — we can’t wait!</li>
<li> AWS Asia Pacific (Osaka) region now open to all, with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-asia-pacific-osaka-region-now-open-to-all-with-three-azs-more-services/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">three availability zones and more services</a>. We think this is a reaction to the huge cloud growth in Japan. </li>
<li> AWS DeepRacer League’s 2021 season launches with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepracer-leagues-2021-season-launches-with-new-open-and-pro-divisions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new Open and Pro divisions</a>. Apparently it&#8217;s gone virtual and is being dominated by experts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: A Bit Jealous</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google introduces GKE Autopilot, a revolutionary mode of operations <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for managed Kubernetes</a>. Autopilot makes it sound like an Oracle product. </li>
<li> Google announces the Risk Protection Program to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-risk-protection-program-now-in-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance trust in cloud ecosystems</a>. Google wants you to pay insurance in case its cloud goes down… </li>
<li> Google extends BigQuery BI engine for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-bi-engine-extends-integration-for-any-bi-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faster insights across popular BI tools</a>. Pretty cool! </li>
<li> New enhancements for Google Cloud Marketplace Private Catalog <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/private-catalog-for-google-cloud-marketplace-supports-terraform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Terraform support</a>. This is pretty good for internal teams managing private catalogs.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Azure: Killing It</h3>

<li> Microsoft has announced a trio of]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Peter’s washing night so please enjoy the soothing sounds of the odd spin cycle as we dive into the huge news coming out of Amazon on The Cloud Pod this week. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> America’s version of Queen Elizabeth has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">stepped down</a>.</li>
<li> Google is a bit late to the party but brings the ice <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-vm-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so we forgive its team</a>.</li>
<li> Azure is trying to claim it came first but <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/02/azure_quantum/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the chicken says otherwise</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow Up: A Bit Slack</h3>
<ul>
<li> Slack explains how the <a href="https://slack.engineering/slacks-outage-on-january-4th-2021/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">January 4th outage occurred</a>. It was all Amazon’s fault. </li>
<li> FogOps for Linux is now available via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hpofvrihuekmo?qid=1612479505050&amp;sr=0-1&amp;ref_=srh_res_product_title" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the AWS Marketplace</a>. Congratulations on getting FogOps on the marketplace, Peter!</li>
<li>General News: It’s Earnings Season!</li>
<li> Microsoft releases <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q2/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">its earnings</a>. This is nuts.  </li>
<li> Alphabet also released <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">its earnings</a>. We hope all the money it’s investing in infrastructure and data centers pays off in the long run, because that’s a big loss. </li>
<li> Amazon announces <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-financial-results-and-ceo-transition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">financial results and CEO transition</a>. That’s some crazy profit. </li>
<li> Outgoing Amazon CEO <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Bezos addresses employees</a>. But who will head AWS now?  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Bon Voyage, Bezos</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS launches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-multiple-private-marketplace-catalogs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">multiple private marketplace catalogs</a> for AWS organizations. Not a problem any of us have so not wowed by this. </li>
<li> AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-privatelink-for-amazon-s3-now-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PrivateLink for Amazon S3</a> is now generally available. We like it but don’t like the pricing. </li>
<li> Amazon Macie announces <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/02/amazon-macie-announces-new-capabilities/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a slew of new capabilities</a>. Check out our sponsor OpenRaven, which is much better at solving the same issue and is much cheaper.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Cloud Pod, apparently there was a machine learning conference because there is A LOT of machine learning news. For the listeners (and hosts of The Cloud Pod) who don’t understand machine learning, buckle up because this will be a long episode for you.    </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon is acting like it’s helping but really it’s <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-data-showed-big-jump-in-diversity-among-senior-leaders-after-definition-of-executive-was-loosened/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lying with numbers</a>.</li>
<li> Google is pretending the 1991 Ford Fiesta it’s selling is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/financial-services/announcing-the-general-availability-of-datashare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 Mustang</a>. </li>
<li> Azure got a little overexcited with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-your-business-applications-data-with-analytical-and-predictive-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the use of its naming bot</a>.</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Your co-hosts are back from Thanksgiving and Re:Invent, and we’re running through all of it for you. In this episode, we cover the lead-up to opening day. Next week, we’ll release an episode fully devoted to Re:Invent coverage. </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;">This week’s highlights</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>CloudWatch has been growing quietly into a much more robust tool with 11 updates since the last episode.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attribute-based access control comes to AWS. This should allow a finer control over your security privileges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>CloudTrail Insights launches with machine learning to help you separate the signal from the noise in your user activity and API usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Amazon EC2 introduces new API </h2>
<p>We’re one step closer to actually paying for what we use with the announcement that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/amazon-ec2-t-instances-now-support-unlimited-mode-at-aws-account-level/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC2 T2 instances will support Unlimited Mode</a> at the account level. If your workload is spread out among multiple accounts, this will be something you should look at. But if you’re looking for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-load-balancer-update-lots-of-new-features-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">load balancer updates</a>, there’s a new batch of those for you too. We especially like the Weighted Target Groups, which have been needed for blue/green deployments for a while now.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;">Restores and Replicas</h3>
<p>Migrating to the cloud has gotten a bit easier with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/amazon-rds-for-sql-server-now-supports-differential-restores-and-log-restores/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">differential and log restores</a> on RDS for SQL servers. Like a lot of the recent announcements, simplicity was highlighted in the announcement of increased availability of DynamoDB tables using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/you-can-now-enhance-availability-of-your-existing-amazon-dynamodb-tables-by-adding-global-replicas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">global table replicas</a>. </p>
<p>“It’ll only take a few clicks” makes it sound like Amazon thinks clicking things must be very taxing on us.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;">Secrets and Cents</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-cloudtrail-insights-identify-and-respond-to-unusual-api-activity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CloudTrail Insights</a> will alert you to unusual activity at a cost of 35 cents per 100,000 write management events analyzed. It’s hard to know yet whether how expensive that will end up being, but it sounds cheap. AWS Single Sign-On will <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-next-evolution-in-aws-single-sign-on/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">connect to Azure AD</a>, making it easier to migrate to Amazon, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/aws-secrets-manager-easier-rotate-secrets-through-cloudformation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Secrets Manager</a> will make it easier to rotate your secrets by handling it at the API level.</p>
<p>AWS is moving from role-based to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-identity-federation-use-employee-attributes-for-access-control-in-aws/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">attribute-based</a> access control and will be implementing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-tag-policies-to-manage-tags-across-multiple-aws-accounts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tag Policies</a> to allow you to cont]]></description>

	<title>133: Google Cloud Serverless Functions now with Servers</title>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, AWS releases new features including Managed Grafana, GCP Serverless solves the cold start problem, and Wiz hacks into CosmosDB.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://cloud.jumpcloud.com/thecloudpod" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a>, which offers a complete platform for identity, access, and device management — no matter where your users and devices are located. </li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS shows no sign of slowing down after the Summit, making Managed Grafana generally available and releasing new features for VPC, CloudFormation, and CloudWatch.</li>
<li> Google introduces new capabilities to minimize cold starts, giving serverless customers the option of using — gasp! — servers. </li>
<li> Wiz finds a critical security flaw in CosmosDB which allowed it to hack into thousands of Azure customers’ databases. Looks like Microsoft needs to make some calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li>  “I just think about all the companies who were … trying to build their own ML models for document recognition and how far they are versus how far Amazon and Google are and Azure. … this is the reason why using your cloud vendor might be the better choice. Because they&#8217;re not even getting this kind of scale and or price reduction for anything they&#8217;re doing on top of ML.”</li>
<li> “I think the main benefit for this change is going to be shared tenancy systems because, with virtualization, everytime there’s a context switch between different tenants on the CPU, you have to throw away that entire cache. The smaller that cache is, the faster that&#8217;s going to be, and the better overall performance you&#8217;ll get from the system.”</li>
<li>”There&#8217;s servers behind everything. So nothing’s serverless just how exposed are you to it? And to me, I  think that level of exposure where it&#8217;s no longer serverless is if I have to patch it.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Docker goes “Full Oracle”</h3>
<ul>
<li> Docker <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3630393/docker-desktop-is-no-longer-free-for-enterprise-users.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announces</a> it will begin charging enterprise customers to use it’s desktop app. Enterprise companies with over $10 million in revenue or greater than 250 employees have until January 31st, 2022 to buy the subscription. In Justin’s words, “that’s just dirty.” </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Can’t Stop Won’t Stop</h3>
<ul>
<li> To enable East-West traffic, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/inspect-subnet-to-subnet-traffic-with-amazon-vpc-more-specific-routing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon has removed some VPC routing restrictions</a>, allowing users to inspect, analyze or filter all traffic flowing between two subnets.  </li>
<li>AWS CloudFormation users are sharing a collective sigh of relief as they can now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-cloudformation-quickly-retry-stack-operations-from-the-point-of-failure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">disable the automatic rollback</a> when a cloud formation fails and retry stack operations from the point of failure. Peter is jumping for joy.</li>
<li>AWS announces a 32% price reduction for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-textract-updates-up-to-32-price-reduction-in-8-aws-regions-and-up-to-50-reduction-in-asynchronous-job-processing-times/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Textract users</a> in 8 regions as well as a 50% reduction in processing ti]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Your co-hosts recap 2019 and make predictions for the year ahead on the first episode of 2020. We’re skipping the Lightning Round this week to focus on a collaborative Q&amp;A segment pulled from our Slack channel.</p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: 26px;">This week’s highlights</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Our top 3 favorite headlines of the year.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Google released a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/supporting-our-customers-with-the-california-consumer-privacy-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white paper</a> to help you comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA.)</li>

</ol>
<h3>2019 Cloud Computing Predictions and Headlines Recap</h3>
<p>Last year (<a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/episode-4-the-podcast-is-now-available-in-multiple-regions/">episode 4</a>), we shared our predictions for what might happen in 2019.</p>
<p>Peter took the lead, predicting container-based models would continue to see more adoption over serverless. Justin — who predicted mergers in cloud providers would create a new top contender, and Jonathan, who predicted an acquisition of Slack — haven’t been vindicated. (Yet!)</p>
<p>Our 3 favorite headlines of the year.</p>
<p>Justin:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Anthos</a> is probably the best thought-out strategy for being multi-cloud with Kubernetes (if currently pricey.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-may-cloud-computing-azure-reliability-lagging-competition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Azure Tardigrade</a> uses machine learning to address hardware failures before they impact uptime.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/05/cloudwatch-container-insights-for-eks-and-kubernetes-preview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cloudwatch Container Insights</a> shows off the power of Cloudwatch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Peter:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Transit Gateway became a viable method of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/aws-transit-gateway-supports-inter-region-peering/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">creating a global network</a>.</li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Santa arrived early and he brought all the goods with him to The Cloud Pod this week. The team dives into all the big announcements from AWS re:invent 2020. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsor:</p>
<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon flips the bird at Microsoft with its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Babelfish announcement</a>. </li>
<li> AWS is angling for a free Jeep Wrangler with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new service</a>.</li>
<li> AWS is helping customers get out of the sticky situation they’re in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-aws-glue-elastic-view-preview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">and don’t know it</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Thankfully They Didn’t Ruin Our Predictions</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon launches managed workflows for Apache Airflow to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-mwaa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">simplify data processing pipelines</a>. Interesting to see it giving some alternative options.  </li>
<li> AWS Lambda now has Code Signing, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-code-signing-a-trust-and-integrity-control-for-aws-lambda/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a trust and integrity control</a> to confirm code is unaltered and from a trusted publisher. Not a nice way to start Thanksgiving if you are Palo Alto. </li>
<li> Amazon announces <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-attributes-based-access-control-with-aws-single-sign-on/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">centralized account access management</a> of AWS Single Sign-On and Attribute-based access control. Has a few rough edges.  </li>
<li> Multi-Region Replication is now enabled for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/multi-region-replication-now-enabled-for-aws-managed-microsoft-active-directory/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory</a>. We’re so glad this is finally here.</li>
<li> Amazon announces reusable building blocks called modules to define infrastructure and applications in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/announcing-modules-for-aws-cloudformation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation</a>. Amazon is jumping on the reusable elements bandwagon with this one.</li>
<li> AWS Security Hub integrates with AWS Organizations for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/aws-security-hub-integrates-with-aws-organizations-for-simplified-security-posture-management/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">simplified security posture management</a>. Basically a centralized security hub.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>AWS Elasticsearch Announcements: </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/amazon-elasticsearch-service-announces-support-for-elasticsearch-version-7-9/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Elasticsearch Service announces support for Elasticsearch version 7.9</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/amazon-elasticsearch-service-supports-anomaly-detection-high-cardinality-datasets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports anomaly detection for high cardinality datasets</a></li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, with the first half of the year full of less-than-ideal events, the team is looking forward to another next six months of less-than-ideal events. Also, everyone is excited to see how they can manipulate the AWS BugBust Challenge for a free ticket to re:Invent.           </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> AWS launches the BugBust Challenge in the hopes of finding and fixing <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-aws-bugbust-worlds-first-global-competition-find" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1 million bugs</a>. The challenge aims to help developers improve code quality, eliminate bugs and boost application performance while saving millions of dollars in application resource costs.</li>
<li> Google has announced new features for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/enhancements-to-the-cloud-monitoring-grafana-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Monitoring Grafana plugins</a>. The new features include popular dashboard samples, more effective troubleshooting with deep links, better visualizations through precalculated metrics and more powerful analysis capabilities.  </li>
<li> Azure VM Image Builder service is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/streamline-your-custom-image-building-process-with-azure-vm-image-builder-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now generally available</a>. Image Builder will make it easier to build custom Linux or Windows virtual machine images.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Does Not Have Bugs </h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces the world’s <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-aws-bugbust-worlds-first-global-competition-find" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">first global competition</a> to find and fix <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-bugbust-its-game-over-for-bugs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1 million software bugs</a>. We don’t think they’re referring to Amazon bugs, just software bugs in general.</li>
<li> AWS launches customized images for Amazon EMR on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/customize-and-package-dependencies-with-your-apache-spark-applications-on-amazon-emr-on-amazon-eks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a>. If you’re looking to reduce the time it takes to build images, that’s a good thing: otherwise it’s a fully managed service, so we’re not sure that users will care.    </li>
<li> Amazon announces new Java Detectors and CI/CD Integration with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_codeguru_reviewer_updates_new_java_detectors_and_cicd_integration_with_github_actions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub Actions for CodeGuru Reviewer</a>. We’re amazed by how quickly GitHub Actions is being adopted.     </li>
<li> AWS acquires communication <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-welcomes-wickr-to-the-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">technology company Wickr</a>. We want to know why Amazon is buying this: maybe they’re trying to enhance their enterprise and public sector application suites. </li>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Cloud Pod this week, the team is feeling nostalgic and a little nerdy, as you can see from the show title — a throwback to Serial Console and its ability to add a ton of characters when you didn’t want it to. </p>
<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon should be singing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/amazon-elasticsearch-service-announces-auto-tune-feature-improved-performance-application-availability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a different tune</a>.</li>
<li> Google has astonished us all by actually <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/cloud-migration/real-world-cloud-migration-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing something interesting</a>.</li>
<li> Azure is the strict school principal that <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/strengthening-compliance-in-azure-security-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just canceled lunch</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3>General News: Justin Said It First </h3>
<ul>
<li> VentureBeat predicts industry clouds could be <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/28/industry-clouds-could-be-the-next-big-thing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the next big thing</a>. Justin will take the royalties check anytime, VentureBeat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Please Don’t Keep It To Yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li> Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/red-hat-openshift-service-on-aws-now-generally-availably/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a>. Surprising because we don’t remember it going into beta.</li>
<li> AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry adds <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-distro-for-opentelemetry-adds-statsd-and-java-support/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">StatsD and Java support</a>. We’re glad to see the continued investment in OpenTelemetry. </li>
<li> AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard solution is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard-solution-is-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a>. The solutions library is a Rube Goldberg machine. </li>
<li> Amazon Lookout for Metrics is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/amazon-lookout-for-metrics-generally-available/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now generally available</a> — perfect for Ryan, who has no machine learning experience. </li>
<li> Amazon Elasticsearch Service announces a new Auto-Tune feature for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/amazon-elasticsearch-service-announces-auto-tune-feature-improved-performance-application-availability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">improved performance and application availability</a>. We wish Amazon would open source this.</li>
<li> AWS SSO credential profile support is now available in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/now-available-aws-sso-credential-profile-support-aws-toolkit-vs-code/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Toolkit for VS Code</a>. Thank you, Jesus.</li>
<li> Amazon is developing a chip to power the hardware switches that <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-steps-up-silicon-ambitions-with-new-networking-chip" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shuttle data around networks</a>. Apparently Google and Apple are also doing this.</li>

Monitoring can be hard on-premises or in the cloud. As a result, it can be downright scary with multi-cloud strategies, hybrid cloud, and legacy tools. Bring order chaos, by centralizing the management of metrics and logs. From solving out of disk space alerts to building observability techniques, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stackdriver</a> and Bindplane can help.  Adopting these practices and principals will help your Observability and SRE teams in the cloud.</p>]]></description>

<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/foghorn">Foghorn Consulting</a>, which provides full-stack cloud solutions with a focus on strategy, planning and execution for enterprises seeking to take advantage of the transformative capabilities of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.</li>

</ul>
<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/13/u-s-judge-temporarily-halts-microsoft-jedi-contract-work-at-amazons-request/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">makes progress</a> contesting the JEDI contract.</li>
<li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-multi-attach-for-provisioned-iops-io1-amazon-ebs-volumes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-preview-of-azure-shared-disks-for-clustered-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure</a> introduce shared cloud block storage.</li>
<li> Google <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/02/18/google-cloud-job-cuts-goog.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shows</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/google-open-source-istio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">signs</a> of shifting priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arrested Development</h3>
<p>United States judge Patricia Campbell-Smith has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/13/u-s-judge-temporarily-halts-microsoft-jedi-contract-work-at-amazons-request/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">granted Amazon’s request</a> to temporarily halt work on the JEDI contract by Microsoft. She also ordered Amazon to post $42 million in the event the injunction was issued wrongfully. </p>
<h3>AWS Not First to Share Blocks</h3>
<p>CloudFormation StackSets users can now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-aws-cloudformation-stacksets-for-multiple-accounts-in-an-aws-organization/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">manage multiple AWS accounts</a>. We recommend you get your organizational units structured properly now so you’re ready for when that must-have feature for your organization is added.</p>
<p>AWS customers running Linux on Ec2 can now attach provisioned IOPS (io1) EBS volumes <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-multi-attach-for-provisioned-iops-io1-amazon-ebs-volumes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">to Multiple Ec2 instances</a>. Be careful though: wielding fine control over your data means taking responsibility for your data losses, as well. This news comes a day after Azure announced their own <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-preview-of-azure-shared-disks-for-clustered-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Shared Disks</a>, which was, for those sweet brief hours before AWS’s announcement, the industry’s only shared cloud block storage.</p>
<h3>What’s in the Box?</h3>
<p>Azure released a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/sql-server-runs-best-on-azure-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new GigaOM study</a> which backs up the findings from the GigaOM study we covered on <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/the-cloud-pod-faster-on-azure-no-wait-aws-episode-58/">episode 58</a>. How incredible — Azure, which paid for the scientific (and unverifiable) study, was found to be the best at everything once again!</p>

<li> It’s the last week of our trial of the new Lightning Round format. Comedy’s hard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TCP News</h3>
<p> ICYMI, check out our second episode of TCP Talks: <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/podcast/tcp-talks-finops-in-the-cloud-with-rob-martin-bonus-ep-2/">Finops in the cloud with Rob Martin</a>. We learned some things about financial operations, and we’re sure you will too.</p>
<h3>AWS Lambda Updates</h3>
<p> AWS Compute Savings Plans <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/savings-plan-update-save-up-to-17-on-your-lambda-workloads/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now apply</a> to your AWS Lambda workloads. That’s nice, but even a decent percentage of such a cheap service probably won’t impact your expenses all that much. In addition, those Lambda workloads now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-a-dart-runtime-for-aws-lambda/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">support Dart</a>, an open-source programming language made by Google. If you’re making mobile apps, you’ll be happy to use this. If you’re not making mobile apps, you probably didn’t need to read this paragraph.</p>
<p> AWS Identity and Access Management now allows you to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-introduces-a-new-control-for-requests-that-aws-services-make-on-your-behalf/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">control access</a> for requests made on your behalf by AWS services. It’s a great security feature. We’re looking forward to AWS taking this a step further at this year’s <a href="https://reinforce.awsevents.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">re:Inforce conference</a>.</p>
<p> Amazon Elastic Container Service <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/amazon-ecs-now-supports-aws-secrets-manager-version-and-json-keys/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now supports</a> previous Secrets Manager versions and can read keys directly from JSON objects. It’s going to be much more convenient now that you can use one key instead of, say, 10.</p>
<p> AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr outlined a laundry list of updates to Amazon FSx for Lustre in this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-fsx-for-lustre-persistent-storage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

<h3>AWS: Let it Snow</h3>
<ul>
<li> The AWS Snow family of devices is now joined by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-aws-snowcone-small-lightweight-edge-storage-and-processing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS Snowcone</a>, a four-and-a-half pound eight terabyte data storage and transfer device, both the most storage and least weight yet. Don’t lose it though — this little guy runs around $2,000.</li>
<li> Aurora Global database now <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-aurora-global-database-supports-read-replica-write-forwarding/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supports</a> write request forwarding for low latency global data reads. This is fantastic news for lazy devs like us. </li>
<li> Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups now support the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-ec2-auto-scaling-now-supports-instance-refresh-within-auto-scaling-groups/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Instance Refresh</a> feature, eliminating the need for custom scripts and systems. This is a long-anticipated feature for TCP. We can’t believe it’s taken until 2020!</li>
<li> The new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/simplifying-serverless-best-practices-with-lambda-powertools/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lambda Powertools library</a> within the Serverless Lens for the Well Architected Framework features Tracer, Logger and Metrics as its three core utilities. Using these tools to get yourself set up will save you a lot of strife down the line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Azure: An ‘Udacious’ Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li> Azure and Udacity are <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-machine-learning-scholarships-and-courses-with-udacity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnering</a> to launch a scholarship program and the free Azure Machine Learning course to address the growing demand for AI specialists. We’ve had good experiences with Udacity so this offering appeals directly to us.</li>
<li> Azure is catering to users new to ARM templates with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/simplifying-declarative-deployments-in-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new features</a> including a template Quickstart gallery and Azure Resource Manager Tools in Visual Studio Code. How did we ever get by without this?</]]></description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.thecloudpod.net/?post_type=podcast&#038;p=918</guid>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>In this TCP Talks episode, Justin Brodley and Jonathan Baker talk with Bart Castle, an AWS and cloud computing trainer and media personality. Bart works with IT training company <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CBT Nuggets</a> and also does cloud-migration consulting projects. </p>
<p>Bart shares the patterns he seems based on training demand and also advises how to decide which certification to go for next. He discusses the importance of solving business problems that will help achieve the business’ goals while retooling and transforming systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point in my career, every technical conversation that I have is always paired up with a business value conversation,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>But how should a data team shift focus to better solve business problems? He suggests looking for patterns. Uncovering patterns can help determine actionable steps to maximize efficiency and enable new business opportunities.</p>
<p>Bart also discusses cloud computing trends, CloudFormation stacking, hybrid deployments, and containers.</p>
<h2>Featured Guest</h2>
<ul>
<li> Name: <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/trainers/bart-castle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bart Castle</a></li>
<li> What he does: Bart is a cloud computing and AWS expert and technical trainer, as well as a consultant. </li>
<li> Key quote: “In the end, we&#8217;re still looking for those tools that will bridge gaps. This is why, for me, being an integrations professional and getting what integration means is skill number one across all different arenas. Everywhere you look, it&#8217;s an integration problem.” </li>
<li> Where to find him: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartcastleit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudbart" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaCZnknpM1TpUnJHl0fv0OA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li> When thinking about all the different training options, Bart suggests pursuing the certification that would help you land a specific job or role. If you&#8217;re not sure what your next job might be, look at SysOps administration first since it is closest to traditional network help desk operations support roles.</li>
<li> Based on his training background, Bart sees a rising interest in network automation. Many teams are working with various vendors to address networking and connectivity and to make the transition from command line administration to Python automation. </li>
</ul>
<p>“A lot of what I&#8217;m seeing here is the switch from real deep specialty to real broad generalization, and that can be an overwhelming bite to take when you look at how much information there is to consume,” says Bart. </p>
<ul>
<li> Learning how the tools work is the easy part, but you have to dig deeper to make it work for your specific business use case. Bart recommends looking for white papers, as well as case studies and blog posts. Communities (like TCP!) can also point you in the right direction.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Bart says, “Once you get those examples of how a piece of input data with the right transformation with this pairing of reporting can solve this problem — now, you&#8217;re putting tools in your belt that are going beyond just using the tools, and how to actually solve business problems with them.”</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s what was mentioned in the episode </h2>
<p> <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CBT Nuggets</a>: provides in-demand training, primarily in IT, project management, and office productivity topics.</p>
<p> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (S3): a cloud object storage service. </p>

<p>A big thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> Amazon will find any excuse to use GIFs just <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/announcing-moving-graphs-for-cloudwatch-dashboards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">like the rest of us</a>.</li>
<li> Google has given Cardi B a headstart on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/better-app-security-with-google-clouds-waap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a theme song for its new product</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: Cheaper Than Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li> Amazon RDS on VMWare no longer requires the use of a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-rds-vmware-networking-simplified-secure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VPN tunnel back to AWS</a>. Still cheaper than paying for healthcare. </li>
<li> Amazon Elasticsearch Service announces support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-elasticsearch-service-announces-support-asynchronous-support/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Asynchronous Search</a>. This is really cool!</li>

<li> AWS announces moving graphs for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/announcing-moving-graphs-for-cloudwatch-dashboards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CloudWatch Dashboards</a>. Also known as GIFs for CloudWatch. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform: Closet Fans of Cardi B</h3>
<ul>
<li> Google announces PHP, a general purpose programming language, is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/php-comes-to-cloud-functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now on Cloud Functions</a>. Visit <a href="https://www.thecloudpod.net/">thecloudpod.net</a> to see a live example of PHP, also known as the WordPress platform we built our website on.  </li>

<h2>This week’s highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li> The Pentagon has had enough of the kids fighting so <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-weighs-ending-jedi-cloud-project-amid-amazon-court-fight-11620639001" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">no one gets the toy</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Amazon Web Services: We’ve Made All the Money</h3>
<ul>
<li> AWS announces a price reduction for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/05/aws-announces-a-price-reduction-for-amazon-managed-service-for-prometheus-amp/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</a>.
