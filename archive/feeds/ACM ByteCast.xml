                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, our special guest host Scott Hanselman (of <a href='https://hanselminutes.com/'>The Hanselminutes Podcast</a>) welcomes 2024 ACM-IEEE CS Eckert-Mauchly Award recipient Wen-Mei Hwu, Senior Distinguished Research Scientist at NVIDIA and Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He was recognized for pioneering and foundational contributions to the design and adoption of multiple generations of processor architectures. His fundamental and pioneering contributions have had a broad impact on three generations of processor architectures: superscalar, VLIW, and throughput-oriented manycore processors (GPUs). Other honors and recognitions include the 1999 ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, 2006 ISCA Most Influential Paper Award, 2014 MICRO Test-of-Time Award, and 2018 CGO Test-of-Time Award. He is the co-author, with David Kirk, of the popular textbook Programming Massively Parallel Processors.</p>
<p>Wen-Mei discusses the evolution of Moore’s Law and the significance of Dennard Scaling, which allowed for faster, more efficient processors without increasing chip size or power consumption. He explains how his research group’s approach to microarchitecture at the University of California, Berkeley in the 80s led to advancements such as Intel’s P6 processor.  Wen-Mei and Scott discuss the early days of processors and the rise of specialized processors and new computational units. They also share their predictions about the future of computing and advancements that will be required to handle vast data sets in real time, and potential devices that would extend human capabilities.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, Harald Störrle hosts ACM Fellow and Software System Award recipient Xavier Leroy, professor at Collège de France and member of the Académie des Sciences. Best known for his role as a primary developer of the OCaml programming language, Xavier is an internationally recognized expert on functional programming languages and compilers, focusing on their reliability and security, and has a strong interest in formal methods, formal proofs, and certified compilation. He is the lead developer of CompCert, the first industrial-strength optimizing compiler with a mechanically checked proof of correctness, with applications to real-world settings as critical as Airbus aircraft. In the past, he was a senior scientist at INRIA, a leading French research institute in computer science, where he is currently a member of the Cambium research team. His honors and recognitions also include the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award and the Milner Award from the Royal Society.

Xavier shares the evolution of Ocaml, which grew out of Caml, an early ML (Meta Language) variant, and how it came to be adopted by Jane Street Capital for its financial applications. He also talks about his interest in formal verification, whose adoption in the software industry is still low due to high costs and the need for mathematical specifications. Harald and Xavier also dive into a discussion of AI tools like Copilot and the current limitations of AI-generated code in software engineering. The conversation also touches on ACM’s efforts to become a more global and diverse organization and opportunities to bridge the gap between academia and industry.</p>

Gilbert’s many honors and recognitions include the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring, the CRA A. Nico Habermann Award, and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation (NMTI).</p>
<p>Juan shares with Scott his surprise at being nominated for the NMTI, which he received in 2023 from President Joe Biden for pioneering a universal voting system that makes voting more reliable and accessible for everyone and for increasing diversity in the computer science workforce. He talks about his lab’s mission to change the world by solving real-world problems, and principles such as “barrier-free design” that he and his collaborators applied to his lab’s voting machine technology. They also discuss how his Application Quest (AQ) technology uses AI to help make fairer hiring decisions, and how his students’ Virtual Traffic Stops app helps protect both drivers and law enforcement safe during traffic stops. Juan also explains how he and his lab choose which projects they work on and teases the promise of brain-computer interaction technology.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, Rashmi Mohan hosts ACM A.M. Turing Award laureate Yoshua Bengio, Professor at the University of Montreal, and Founder and Scientific Director of MILA (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms) at the Quebec AI Institute. Yoshua shared the 2018 Turing Award with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun for their work on deep learning. He is also a published author and the most cited scientist in Computer Science. Previously, he founded Element AI, a Montreal-based artificial intelligence incubator that turns AI research into real-world business applications, acquired by ServiceNow. He currently serves as technical and scientific advisor to Recursion Pharmaceuticals and scientific advisor for Valence Discovery. He is a Fellow of ACM, the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Canada, Officer of the Order of Canada, and recipient of the Killam Prize, Marie-Victorin Quebec Prize, and Princess of Asturias Award. Yoshua also serves on the United Nations Scientific Advisory Board for Independent Advice on Breakthroughs in Science and Technology and as a Canada CIFAR AI Chair. 

Yoshua traces his path in computing, from programming games in BASIC as an adolescent to getting interested in the synergy between the human brain and machines as a graduate student. He defines deep learning and talks about knowledge as the relationship between symbols, emphasizing that interdisciplinary collaborations with neuroscientists were key to innovations in DL. He notes his and his colleagues’ surprise in the speed of recent breakthroughs with transformer architecture and large language models and talks at length about about artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the major risks it will present, such as loss of control, misalignment, and nationals security threats. Yoshua stresses that mitigating these will require both scientific and political solutions, offers advice for researchers, and shares what he is most excited about with the future of AI.</p>

Turing Award laureate Yoshua Bengio, Professor at the University of Montreal, and Founder and Scientific Director of MILA (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms) at the Quebec AI Institute. Yoshua shared the 2018 Turing Award with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun for their work on deep learning. He is also a published author and the most cited scientist in Computer Science. Previously, he founded Element AI, a Montreal-based artificial intelligence incubator that turns AI research into real-world business applications, acquired by ServiceNow. He currently serves as technical and scientific advisor to Recursion Pharmaceuticals and scientific advisor for Valence Discovery. He is a Fellow of ACM, the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Canada, Officer of the Order of Canada, and recipient of the Killam Prize, Marie-Victorin Quebec Prize, and Princess of Asturias Award. Yoshua also serves on the United Nations Scientific Advisory Board for Independent Advice on Breakthroughs in Science and Technology and as a Canada CIFAR AI Chair. Yoshua traces his path in computing, from programming games in BASIC as an adolescent to getting interested in the synergy between the human brain and machines as a graduate student. He defines deep learning and talks about knowledge as the relationship between symbols, emphasizing that interdisciplinary collaborations with neuroscientists were key to innovations in DL. He notes his and his colleagues’ surprise in the speed of recent breakthroughs with transformer architecture and large language models and talks at length about about artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the major risks it will present, such as loss of control, misalignment, and nationals security threats. Yoshua stresses that mitigating these will require both scientific and political solutions, offers advice for researchers, and shares what he is most excited about with the future of AI.]]></itunes:summary>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, Bruke Kifle hosts Jacki O'Neill, Director of the Microsoft Africa Research Institute (MARI) in Nairobi, Kenya, where she is building a multi-disciplinary team combining research, engineering, and design to solve local problems globally. Her research interests span AI, HCI, social science, and technology for emerging markets. An ethnographer by trade, Jacki has focused on technologies for work—with the aim of making work better; and technologies for societal impact, with the aim of supporting underserved communities. She has led major research projects in the future of work from new labor platforms to workplace AI and chat; digital currencies and financial inclusion; and Global Healthcare. She has received two innovation awards and 16 patents (from new interaction mechanisms to crowdsourcing), and has served on the program and organizing committees of major conferences such as CHI, CSCW, ICTD, and ECSCW for many years.</p>
<p>In the interview, Jacki traces her path from her early days growing up in Plymouth, UK to discovering an interest in computing at the University of Manchester after initially studying psychology. She describes how her background has influenced her approach in the design of technology and some primary methodologies she has used. Jacki reflects on the establishment and mission of MARI, and the benefits and challenges of collaborating across different multidisciplinary teams. She also shares what she sees as the biggest opportunities for technology in Africa and what local problems can be solved, touching on her approach to cross-cultural differences such as AI and equitable language systems. Finally, Jacki offers some exciting future directions and visions for computing in Africa and advice for making a social impact in the field.</p>

In addition to scientific journals, his work has been featured in Forbes, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and Financial Times and his recognitions include Forbes 30 Under 30, Fortune 40 Under 40, and being a TEDx Speaker.

Eugenio discusses how early passions in engineering, technology, and robotics led him to work in AI and data science, and a lack of the human component in these fields has driven his work. He describes his work on MIT Media Lab’s Project US, which uses AI and advanced biosignal processing to help people become more effective and empathetic leaders and organizations make tangible progress towards their HR goals, and how that research shifted when COVID hit and people worked from home. Eugenio and Rashmi also touch on the common challenges and concerns across different industries, such as data sharing and privacy, and his views on synthetic data. He also shares some of the most important lessons learned in his career and offers advice for students looking to build solutions with machine learning.</p>

<p>Initially fascinated by biomedical engineering, Mor shares how she arrived at the intersection of information systems and medicine, after working in IT and completing her postdoctoral research at Stanford. She mentions her recent project, MobiGuide, which aims to narrow the gap between clinical guidance and patient needs by providing 24/7 decision support to patients and providers. Its current focus is on improving the mental wellbeing of cancer patients through evidence-based practices such as exercise, yoga, and positive psychology. Mor also shares advice for people (especially women) looking to work in interdisciplinary fields. She emphasizes the importance of health equity and how AI can be employed in the service of detecting unfairness.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, our special guest host Scott Hanselman (of <a href='https://hanselminutes.com/'>The Hanselminutes Podcast</a>) welcomes 2022 ACM A.M. Turing Award Laureate Robert Metcalfe, Emeritus Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin and Research Affiliate in Computational Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). Metcalfe received his Turing Award for the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet, the foundational technology of the Internet, which supports more than 5 billion users and enables much of modern life. His other honors include the National Medal of Technology, IEEE Medal of Honor, Marconi Prize, Japan Computer &amp; Communications Prize, ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, and IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal. He is a Fellow of the US National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Inventors, Consumer Electronics, and Internet Halls of Fame.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview, Bob reflects on his “Ethernet paper” with David Boggs from 1976, and how the interoperability and backward compatibility baked into the Ethernet allows the technology to hold up today, in the age of Netflix and Zoom. Bob also describes his most recent project, modeling geothermal wells as a computational engineer at MIT, with the aim of harnessing geothermal energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. Along the way, they touch on “stretch goals,” GPUs, and how far down “the stack” one needs to go to fully appreciate and understand a piece of technology.

As joint creators of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, they introduced the world to the transformative idea of public key cryptography, the underpinning of every secure transaction on the internet today. Whitfield has spent a large portion of his career as a security practitioner, including roles at Northern Telecom and Sun Microsystems. He is an elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society and a recipient of numerous other awards and accolades in computing. He's currently a consulting scholar at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. Martin is a Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. He's also a recipient of the RSA Lifetime Achievement Award, among many other recognitions. Both have received the Marconi Prize and have been inducted into the National Cybersecurity Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Whitfield and Martin share their individual journeys to computer science and cryptography, which were shaped both by personal interests and the geopolitical realities of the time. They also describe how they met and developed a rapport with each other as researchers. They share their “aha moment” in public key cryptography and how the internet  catapulted commercial cryptography in the 1990s. They also share their thoughts on computing privacy, national security, and quantum computing and its implications for both Diffie-Hellman and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystems. They touch on end-to-end encryption and the field of technology in the next five years. Along the way, they share colorful details from their early years and share advice for young people aspiring to get into computing</p>

After working for several years as a practicing pediatrician, Holly transitioned to working in product management roles for Healthcare IT vendors, including product leadership roles at McKesson and Hearst Health. Most recently, Holly was Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO) at Oracle Cerner before recently starting a new role as VP of Clinical Product Design at CliniComp.</p>
<p>Holly describes how she became interested in medical informatics, product design, and management and how that inspired her to serve in an ambassador role between clinical and technical teams. She talks about transitioning from her role as CMIO at Oracle Cerner where she focused on software implementation and deployment to designing a new electronic health record (EHR) system at CliniComp. She stresses the importance of data literacy to analyze the reams of data generated by EHR and the promise of AI and ML in measuring effectiveness of interventions such as medical procedures and medications—as well as the issue of bias with these tools. Lastly, Holly shares valuable advice for professionals who are thinking about switching job roles.</p>

Yaw is the founder and CEO of ODK (Open Data Kit), the offline data collection platform that helps fight disease, poverty, and inequity. He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Washington and likes to keep his bio short and sweet.</p>
<p>Yaw describes how he felt the urge to pivot his career into a direction of positive social impact as a graduate student at the University of Washington. A volunteer experience with Partners in Health in Rwanda and a software engineering internship at Google showed him the potential for technology to empower people and change lives—specifically through ODK—which became his chief project and passion. Yaw and Scott discuss ODK’s main differentiator, “powerful offline forms,” as well as user interface affordances made to customize ODK for its users, such as rural farmers in Uganda. He also shares the joy of working on a product that focuses on public good and some principles that have helped him to succeed.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, Rashmi Mohan hosts 2020 ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award recipient Shyam Gollakota. He is a Torode Professor and leads the Networks and Mobile Systems Lab at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Shyam is the recipient of many awards and recognitions, including a SIGMOBILE Rockstar award, 2021 Moore Inventor Fellowship, MIT Technology Review’s 35 Innovators Under 35, Popular Science ‘brilliant 10,’ and the Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list (twice). His group’s research has earned Best Paper awards at many top conferences, appeared in interdisciplinary journals like Nature, Nature Communications, Science Translational Medicine, and Science Robotics, and was named as an MIT Technology Review Breakthrough Technology of 2016 as well as Popular Science top innovations in 2015. Shyam's research covers a variety of topics, including mobile machine learning, networking, human-computer interaction, battery-free computing, and mobile health. He works across multiple disciplines including computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, and medicine. His work has been licensed by ResMed Inc, led to three startups (Jeeva Wireless, Sound Life Sciences, and Wavely Diagnostics), and is in use by millions of users.</p>
<p>Shyam, who didn’t know how to type on a keyboard until the age of 16, relates how he got into CS and discovered that more than just programming, it's also a toolkit people can use to build systems like an artist and solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. He describes his work around the ambient backscatter, which uses existing radio frequency signals to power devices, and wind dispersal powered devices (and how the common dandelion provided inspiration for this research). Shyam and Rashmi also talk about his work on devices used for sleep apnea and tracking and the broader promise of ubiquitous computing in healthcare, such as democratizing medical attention to areas that don’t have the same resources as the Western world. Finally, Shyam gives some insights into the entrepreneurial journey and looks toward the future of healthcare technology.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, Rashmi Mohan hosts ACM Fellow Margo Seltzer, co-recipient of the 2020 ACM Software System Award (shared with Mike Olson of Cloudera and Keith Bostic of MongoDB). She is the Canada 150 Research Chair in Computer Systems and the Cheriton Family Chair in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Previously, Seltzer was the Herchel Smith Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University’s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Director at the Center for Research on Computation and Society. She is especially renowned for her work on log-structured file systems, databases, and wide-scale caching. Seltzer was previously CTO of Sleepycat Software, developers of the BerkeleyDB embedded database, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Among her many honors, she is the recipient of the 2020 SIGMOD Systems Award and was recently named one of the “Top 20 Canadian Women in Cyber Security” by IT World Canada.</p>
<p>In the wide-ranging interview, Margo discusses her early years growing up in a high-achieving family and later studying applied mathematics at Harvard (before they had a CS major). She also recalls the amazing time in grad school studying under four legendary professors (including her advisor, Michael Stonebraker), and the origins of BerkeleyDB, which started as a graduate student open-source project and later became Sleepycat Software. Margo emphasizes the importance of taking risks and getting out of your comfort zone (and comfort research area) and inter-disciplinary collaboration, something she encourages in mentoring her students and junior colleagues. She also stresses the responsibility that comes with success and the value of mentoring students and providing guidance for impactful roles in service as well as research.</p>

<p>In the wide-ranging interview, Margo discusses her early years growing up in a high-achieving family and later studying applied mathematics at Harvard (before they had a CS major). She also recalls the amazing time in grad school studying under four legendary professors (including her advisor, Michael Stonebraker), and the origins of BerkeleyDB, which started as a graduate student open-source project and later became Sleepycat Software. Margo emphasizes the importance of taking risks and getting out of your comfort zone (and comfort research area) and inter-disciplinary collaboration, something she encourages in mentoring her students and junior colleagues. She also stresses the responsibility that comes with success and the value of mentoring students and providing guidance for impactful roles in service as well as research.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of ACM ByteCast, Rashmi Mohan hosts 2020 ACM-IEEE CS Eckert-Mauchly Award recipient Luiz André Barroso of Google, where he drove transformation of hyperscale computing infrastructure and led engineering for key products like Google Maps. Luiz is a Google Fellow and Head of the Office of Cross-Google Engineering (XGE), responsible for company-wide technical coordination. Prior to that, he was Vice President of Engineering in Google Maps and led the Core team, the group primarily responsible for the technical foundation behind Google's flagship products. Prior to Google, Luiz was a member of the research staff at Digital Equipment Corporation and Compaq, where his group did some of the pioneering work on multi-core architectures. He co-authored The Datacenter as a Computer, the first textbook to describe the architecture of warehouse-scale computing systems. Luiz is a Fellow of ACM and AAAS.</p>
<p>In the interview, Luiz looks back on growing up in Brazil, and how family played a part in his early affinity for electrical engineering which progressed to computer engineering. He recalls his master’s advisor, who stimulated his fascination in Local Area Networks and queuing theory, and how this got him interested in computer science. Luiz also talks about his first job in computing at IBM Research in Rio de Janeiro, and his PhD days at USC in Los Angeles, which got him involved in computer architecture and gave him an early taste of both research and practice in memory systems.

Turing Award laureate Leslie Lamport of Microsoft Research, best known for his seminal work in distributed and concurrent systems, and as the initial developer of the document preparation system LaTeX and the author of its first manual. Among his many honors and recognitions, Lamport is a Fellow of ACM and has received the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award, the Dijkstra Prize, and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal.

Leslie shares his journey into computing, which started out as something he only did in his spare time as a mathematician. Scott and Leslie discuss the differences and similarities between computer science and software engineering, the math involved in Leslie’s high-level temporal logic of actions (TLA), which can help solve the famous Byzantine Generals Problem, and the algorithms Leslie himself has created. He also reflects on how the building of distributed systems has changes since the 60s and 70s.</p>

Her research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction and software engineering. In her work she identifies and dismantles cognitive and social barriers by designing mechanisms to support software developer participation in online socio-technical ecosystems. Ford is also a recipient of the National GEM Consortium Fellowship, National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, and Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship. She is best known for her research on just-in-time mentorship as a mode to empower welcoming engagement in collaborative Q&A for online programming communities, including open-source software and work to empower marginalized software developers in online communities.</p>
<p>In the interview, Ford relates how an undergraduate research project inspired her to pursue a PhD in computing. She describes her approach in designing various research studies, the process she used to identify challenges and barriers to engagement in communities such as StackOverflow and GitHub, and how she and her collaborators went about building interventions. They also discuss how some of these interventions can be applied by industry. Ford also shares some future directions and developments in computing that most excite her—and the possibilities in making the field more equitable and inclusive.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the latest episode of ACM ByteCast, host Jessica Bell chats with former ACM President Vint Cerf, Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, an Internet pioneer widely recognized as one of “the fathers of the Internet.” His many recognitions include the ACM A.M. Turing Award, the National Medal of Technology, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Marconi Prize.</p>
<p>Cerf takes us along on an amazing voyage from seeing his first tube-based computer in 1958 to his work on ARPANET and TCP/IP with Bob Kahn, providing a brief history of the Internet in the process. Along the way, he explains how they approached the problem of building a network architecture that scaled astronomically over time. Cerf also points to important social, business, and ethical problems yet to be resolved, and explains why it’s an exciting time to be a student in computing.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Rashmi Mohan welcomes ACM Fellow and past ACM-W Athena Lecturer Jennifer Widom, the Frederick Emmons Terman Dean of the School of Engineering and Fletcher Jones Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Widom has made significant contributions to databases and data science. She’s a member of the NAE and AAAS, a Guggenheim Fellow, and recipient of the ACM SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award and EPFL-WISH Foundation Erna Hamburger Prize. Widom has co-authored textbooks widely used for teaching database systems design, use, and implementation, served as editor of top academic journals, and keynoted and chaired major conferences, such as SIGMOD and VLDB.</p>
<p>She discusses her unconventional journey from undergraduate music performance major to computer science doctoral student and researcher at IBM’s Almaden lab, where her interest in databases and information management was cemented. Widom looks back on the heyday of Massively Open Online Courses, when her “Introduction to Databases” class had more than 100,000 enrolled students, and describes some of the challenges that have prevented MOOCs from truly upending higher education. She also describes her unusual sabbatical spent traveling the world and teaching free classes in databases and data science in developing countries, and offers bits of wisdom for those looking for similar experiences.</p>

She's widely known for her work on algorithmic fairness and predictive policing and is a key organizer of the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT).

Lum discusses her transition from math and statistics into computer science, and how her lab work in bioinformatics expanded her interest into social issues. They touch on the sensitive nature of data and privacy and gray areas in criminal justice data collection. Lum mentions some applications of her work, advising the NYC Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice and partnering with the ACLU. She also describes a very timely project accounting for the time lag between COVID-19 infection and death. Finally, she traces her winding, fascinating career path from academic to industry and back.</p>

Currently a Fellow at Dell EMC, Perlman is famous for writing the spanning tree protocol (STP), which powers the Ethernet. She reflects on her early days at MIT and later Digital Equipment Corporation, where she worked on DECnet, one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, and how that inspired her doctoral thesis on routing in the face of malicious network failures.

Currently a Fellow at Dell EMC, Perlman is famous for writing the spanning tree protocol (STP), which powers the Ethernet. She reflects on her early days at MIT and later Digital Equipment Corporation, where she worked on DECnet, one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, and how that inspired her doctoral thesis on routing in the face of malicious network failures.

Turing Laureate Donald Knuth, author of the hugely popular textbook series, "The Art of Computer Programming." They discuss what led him to discover his love of computing as well as writing about computer programming, his outlook on how people learn technical skills, how his mentorship has helped him write “human oriented” programs, the problems he is still working to solve, and how his dissatisfaction with early digital typesetting led him to develop TeX, as well as his interest in playing and composing music for the pipe organ.</p>
