      <title>AI and the Future of Media Consumption | Pete Pachal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p> In this episode of Open Source Data, Charna Parkey interviews Pete Pachal, founder of The Media Copilot. With over two decades of experience covering technology, Pete shares his insights on how AI is transforming media, journalism and discusses  how journalists can embrace AI as a tool to enhance their work to adapt and thrive in this new environment. </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p><strong>PETE PACHAL:</strong> <i>AI is something that you control. I know, it feels like it's a wave that's coming over that it's unstoppable, inevitable. And that's true to a large extent. But at the same time, it's not, there's no there, right? There's no spark, there's no intent. (...)

Maybe it will take a lot of time to do that. A lot of resources to do that but something small, which you can have an opportunity to solve that could be very big or a fundamental for quite a bit is fantastic. Think of a scenario where your small fundamental idea is a base for another small fundamental idea for someone else."</i></p><p> </p><p>Charna Parkey</p><p><i>We also want to ground it a little bit in impact we've been seeing. And I think in the financial, banking, insurance industries it's not, I would say, an even distribution of advancement. Different countries have different regulations and different appetites for risk."</i><br /><br /><br /><strong>Timestamps</strong><br />- [00:00:00] Introduction by Charna Parkey.</p><p>- [00:01:57] Vinay Kumar begins talking about his journey.</p><p>- [00:05:27] Discussion on building a search engine for STEM researchers.</p><p>- [00:07:06] Challenges with early deep learning.</p><p>- [00:09:55] Conversation shifts to ML observability.</p><p>- [00:17:06] Discussion on simplifying verticalized AI.</p><p>- [00:22:30] Impact of large language models (LLMs) on AI.</p><p>- [00:30:58] Comparison of autonomous cars with AI regulation.</p><p>- [00:37:58] Vinay mentions his science fiction novels.</p><p>- [00:42:19] Conversation summary with Producer Leo Godoy.</p>

Maybe it will take a lot of time to do that. A lot of resources to do that but something small, which you can have an opportunity to solve that could be very big or a fundamental for quite a bit is fantastic. Think of a scenario where your small fundamental idea is a base for another small fundamental idea for someone else."</i></p><p> </p><p>Charna Parkey</p><p><i>We also want to ground it a little bit in impact we've been seeing. And I think in the financial, banking, insurance industries it's not, I would say, an even distribution of advancement. Different countries have different regulations and different appetites for risk."</i><br /><br /><br /><strong>Timestamps</strong><br />- [00:00:00] Introduction by Charna Parkey.</p><p>- [00:01:57] Vinay Kumar begins talking about his journey.</p><p>- [00:05:27] Discussion on building a search engine for STEM researchers.</p><p>- [00:07:06] Challenges with early deep learning.</p><p>- [00:09:55] Conversation shifts to ML observability.</p><p>- [00:17:06] Discussion on simplifying verticalized AI.</p><p>- [00:22:30] Impact of large language models (LLMs) on AI.</p><p>- [00:30:58] Comparison of autonomous cars with AI regulation.</p><p>- [00:37:58] Vinay mentions his science fiction novels.</p><p>- [00:42:19] Conversation summary with Producer Leo Godoy.</p>

      <title>Navigating Open Source Talent, AI &amp; Policy Challenges with Amanda Brock</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Amanda Brock's path began with picking potatoes at 8 years old. Now, she's the CEO of OpenUK, advocating for open source across the UK. In this insightful interview, Brock shares her journey into open source law and policy. She dives into OpenUK's latest research on the state of open technology in Britain, talent challenges, and the economic impact of open source contributions. Brock also unpacks key discussions from State of OpenCon 2024 on open data, generative AI, and balanced regulation. <br /><br /><strong>Episode timestamps</strong></p><p><strong>(05:06):</strong> State of open source in the UK  </p><p><strong>(07:22):</strong> Importance of open source community  </p><p><strong>(15:19):</strong> Balancing openness and regulation in AI  </p><p><strong>(21:19):</strong> Pace of technological development and regulation</p><p><strong>(28:21):</strong> Reliability and discernment with AI outputs</p><p><strong>(35:24):</strong> Universal advice</p><p> </p><p><strong>Quotes</strong></p><p><i><strong>Amanda Brock</strong></i></p><p><i>“I think the governments that are going to win, the governments that are going to have the best regulation that promotes most innovation are going to be the ones which are able to make their regulatory environment flow in the same way as the technology evolution and innovation flows."</i></p><p><i><strong>Charna Parkey</strong></i></p><p><i>"I think the expectation needs to change. Part of what has happened with, you know, literal text search or keyword search and just Google and things like that, is that the average person expects what comes back to be relatively factual. That it's been referenced and, you know, backlinked, etc. That's a deterministic system. These are not.

And it just still amazes me that we have these open source projects like jQuery is a project of the OpenJS Foundation and it's in a tremendous amount of our ecommerce infrastructure. But it's a project that's maintained by a very small team of contributors. And, you know, if this were a commercial product, it would be like a $1,000,000,000 company. (...)

      <title>New Beginnings: Open||Source||Data in Transition</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Charna Parkey, Real-Time AI Product and Strategy Leader at DataStax. Charna has been developing AI and ML products over the last 17 years and has worked with 90 of the Fortune 100 in her various roles. She is also a co-author and inventor on several patents.</p><p>In this episode, Sam and Charna discuss handing over the role as host, Sam’s new startup journey, and how their thinking has evolved during the explosion of LLMs.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“Now, it seems like we have this opportunity where the conversation and the place that society is at is different. Where we want to contribute to the right set of data when we talk open source data. We want to make sure that we have the right data to train this model in order to get the right outcome. We want to provide a lens of, ‘All right, you are this persona. How would you say this thing?’ I do think that from a lot of what the LLMs have today, the outcome of those words are still missing. And we need to solve that. Like, ‘Is this piece of writing actually going to achieve the outcome I want versus am I following legal's guidelines? Am I technically correct? Is my CEO going to like it?’ That doesn't mean you're achieving impact in the world. There's an aspect there where we've given feedback loops, it seems, to be like, ‘Did I like the answer or not?’ But not, ‘Did I take an action?’ As we get to autonomousness, we're going to have to have an outcome or multiple outcomes associated with the reward of the system.” – Charna Parkey</p><p>“I personally believe that all cognition is bias. My degree is in cognitive science. One of the things that we trained on is attention. And to pay attention, literally means to selectively choose what data is coming in from the world that you're going to pay attention to and what you're going to discard. Which is also, to me, the definition of bias. All cognition is bias, but what do we care about? Do you trust this thing? What does that mean? Well, do you trust it to do these particular actions to a level of consistency in this particular domain? It doesn't mean that you're going to trust it in all environments. There's a lot more nuance that hopefully will evolve in this strange age of nuanced destruction machines.” – Sam Ramji</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(01:04): Sam and Charna catch up </p><p>(06:05): Sam explains his new company, Sailplane </p><p>(14:21): How Charna’s thinking has evolved during the LLM explosion</p><p>(25:45): Sam’s thoughts after 5 seasons of Open||Source||Data</p><p>(38:52): What Charna is looking forward to in the next season of the podcast</p><p>(40:44): A question Sam wishes to be asked</p><p>(45:45): Backstage takeaways with executive producer, Audra Montenegro</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charnaparkey/">LinkedIn - Connect with Charna</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sramji/">LinkedIn - Connect with Sam</a></p><p><a href="https://www.sailplane.ai/">Learn more about Sailplane</a></p>

      <title>The Intersection of Open Source and AI with Stefano Maffulli &amp; Stephen O’Grady</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features a panel discussion with Stefano Maffulli, Executive Director of the Open Source Initiative (OSI); and Stephen O’Grady, Co-founder of RedMonk. Stefano has decades of experience in open source advocacy. He co-founded the Italian chapter of Free Software Foundation Europe, built the developer community of the OpenStack Foundation, and led open source marketing teams at several international companies. Stephen has been an industry analyst for several decades and is author of the developer playbook, <i>The New Kingmakers: How Developers Conquered the World</i>.</p><p>In this episode, Sam, Stefano, and Stephen discuss the intersection of open source and AI, good data for everyone, and open data foundations.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“Internet Archive, Wikipedia, they have that mission to accumulate data. The OpenStreetMap is another big one with a lot of interesting data. It's a fascinating space, though. There are so many facets of the word ‘data.’ One of the reasons why open data is so hard to manage and hasn't had that same impact of open source is because, like Stephen, the stories that he was telling about the startups having a hard time assembling the mixing and matching, or modifying of data has a different connotation. It's completely different from being able to do the same with software.” – Stefano Maffulli</p><p>“It's also not clear how said foundation would get buy-in. Because, as far as a lot of the model holders themselves, they've been able to do most of what they want already. What's the foundation really going to offer them? They've done what they wanted. Not having any inside information here, but just judging by the fact that they are willing to indemnify their users, they feel very confident legally in their stance. Therefore, it at least takes one of the major cards off the table for them.” – Stephen O’Grady</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(01:44): What open source in the context of AI means to each guest</p><p>(16:21): Stefano explains OSI’s opportunity to shine a light on models and teams</p><p>(21:22): The next step of open source AI according to Stephen</p><p>(25:38): Creating better definitions in order to modify software</p><p>(33:09): The case of funding an open data foundation</p><p>(42:31): The future of open source data</p><p>(51:54): Executive producer, Audra Montenegro's backstage takeaways</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maffulli/">LinkedIn - Connect with Stefano</a></p><p><a href="https://members.opensource.org/">Visit Open Source Initiative</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sogrady/">LinkedIn - Connect with Stephen</a></p><p><a href="https://redmonk.com/">Visit RedMonk</a></p>

Not having any inside information here, but just judging by the fact that they are willing to indemnify their users, they feel very confident legally in their stance. Therefore, it at least takes one of the major cards off the table for them.” – Stephen O’Grady</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(01:44): What open source in the context of AI means to each guest</p><p>(16:21): Stefano explains OSI’s opportunity to shine a light on models and teams</p><p>(21:22): The next step of open source AI according to Stephen</p><p>(25:38): Creating better definitions in order to modify software</p><p>(33:09): The case of funding an open data foundation</p><p>(42:31): The future of open source data</p><p>(51:54): Executive producer, Audra Montenegro's backstage takeaways</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maffulli/">LinkedIn - Connect with Stefano</a></p><p><a href="https://members.opensource.org/">Visit Open Source Initiative</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sogrady/">LinkedIn - Connect with Stephen</a></p><p><a href="https://redmonk.com/">Visit RedMonk</a></p>

You can have a way to label them, to capture information.” – Mikiko Bazeley</p><p>“I really like that analogy as well. I like how Mikiko put it where a vector search engine is really extracting value from what you've already got. [...] So where I see vector search engines, really, is if we think of these embedding providers as the translators to take all of our unstructured data and bring it into vector space into a common machine language, vector search engines are essentially the workhorses that allow us to compute and search over these objects in vectorized format. They're essentially the calculators of the AI stack.” – Zain Hasan</p><p>“Haystack, I would really position as the kitchen. I need Mikiko to bring the apples. I need Zain to bring the pears.

There's a lot that has changed from even people, their education level, but use cases also just within the last three years. Can we, as a tool, let users have some control and what they define as quality data reliability, and then monitor on those metrics was some of the things that we have done.

      <title>Reframing Machine Learning and AI-Assisted Development with Jorge Torres</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Jorge Torres, Co-founder and CEO of MindsDB.

      <title>ML Engineering Teams and Niche Chat Bot Experiences with Demetrios Brinkmann</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Demetrios Brinkmann, Founder of the MLOps Community, an organization for people to share best practices around MLOps. Demetrios fell into the Machine Learning Operations world and has since interviewed leading names around MLOps, data science, and machine learning. </p><p>In this episode, Sam sits down with Demetrios to discuss LLM in production use cases, ML engineering teams, and the LLM Survey Report from the MLOps Community.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>"I think the most novel ones that I saw from the survey were when a chat bot would prompt a human as opposed to the human prompting the chat bot. It's almost like you have this LLM coach. And in that way, it's not necessarily like this isn't LLM in production that an end user is getting that's not outside the business or that is outside the business. It's more like internally, you can think about maybe it's an accountant and the accountant is filing my taxes for the year. As they're filing them, the LLM is prompting them on different tax laws that maybe they weren't thinking about or different ways that they could file things." – Demetrios Brinkmann</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(04:30): LLMs as the new standard</p><p>(19:26): Key LLM in production use cases</p><p>(31:18): What open source data means to Demetrios</p><p>(34:36): What Demetrios is seeing in open source AI models</p><p>(42:44): One question Demetrios wishes to be asked</p><p>(44:41): Demetrios’s advice for the audience</p><p>(47:19): Backstage takeaways with executive producer, Audra Montenegro</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/">LinkedIn - Connect with Demetrios</a></p><p><a href="https://mlops.community/surveys/llm/">Read the LLM Survey Report</a></p><p><a href="https://podcast.mlops.community/">Listen to The MLOps Podcast</a></p>

And in that way, it's not necessarily like this isn't LLM in production that an end user is getting that's not outside the business or that is outside the business. It's more like internally, you can think about maybe it's an accountant and the accountant is filing my taxes for the year. As they're filing them, the LLM is prompting them on different tax laws that maybe they weren't thinking about or different ways that they could file things." – Demetrios Brinkmann</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(04:30): LLMs as the new standard</p><p>(19:26): Key LLM in production use cases</p><p>(31:18): What open source data means to Demetrios</p><p>(34:36): What Demetrios is seeing in open source AI models</p><p>(42:44): One question Demetrios wishes to be asked</p><p>(44:41): Demetrios’s advice for the audience</p><p>(47:19): Backstage takeaways with executive producer, Audra Montenegro</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/">LinkedIn - Connect with Demetrios</a></p><p><a href="https://mlops.community/surveys/llm/">Read the LLM Survey Report</a></p><p><a href="https://podcast.mlops.community/">Listen to The MLOps Podcast</a></p>

      <title>Web3 and Putting Reputation on Code with ML with Omoju Miller</title>

Originally from Lagos, Nigeria, Omoju holds a doctoral degree in Computer Science Education from UC Berkeley. Her expertise in machine learning and computational intelligence led her to companies such as Google and GitHub. Omoju also served as a volunteer advisor to the Obama administration’s White House Presidential Innovation Fellows.</p><p>In this episode, Sam sits down with Omoju to discuss how machine learning can make applications more secure, what the future of the internet looks like, and the fascinating story behind Fimio.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“So my first view is, in this future internet we have people, we also have bots, we have machines, we have code doing things. And bots sounds like such a horrible word now. [...] You need to have a level of trust on what that bot is. Everything from the humans to the machines collaborating in this decentralized world, we need to have some kind of reputation attached to each of those nodes. And the reason why we need that reputation is, as the thing scales, it becomes overwhelming to get value from it. You need something to help you filter, to find what you're looking for. Otherwise, you get stuck in that environment where you're just completely overwhelmed and you don't even know what to do.

      <title>The Human Right to Privacy and Caring About UX Design with Yuliia Tkachova</title>

She holds degrees in Management Information Systems, Math, Statistics, and Marketing. Prior to Masthead, Yuliia designed complex BI products and solutions powered by ML and utilized by Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>In this episode, Sam and Yuliia discuss how ML is shaping the future of data analytics, caring about users, and the fundamental human right to privacy.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“We map those errors and anomalies on lineage, helping to understand what upstreams and downstreams are affected, what business users are affected. And that actually speeds up all the troubleshooting from hours to minutes. And this is the ultimate goal where we deliver. Because again, my belief that if you don't have this lineage piece was mapped anomalous in errors, it's not observability. It's monitoring. [...] What is also very unique to us, because Masthead operates on logs, it's triggered by logs. So, we do support streaming data. Unlike SQL-first solutions, as you can guess. We don't have to run SQL queries to see if they're anomalous, we’re triggered by logs.

      <title>Determinism in Complex Environments and Workflow Services with Maxim Fateev</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Maxim Fateev, Co-founder and CEO of Temporal, an open source, distributed, and scalable workflow orchestration engine capable of running millions of workflows. He has 20 years of experience architecting mission-critical systems at Uber, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. </p><p>In this episode, Sam sits down with Maxim to discuss workflow services, the power behind Temporal, and bringing determinism to highly complex environments.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“[Temporal] has this notion of workflows, which can run for a very long time and handle external events, you can treat them as a durable actor.

Like, new data came in, notify this object, this object will go and retrain it. Or, it'll run an activity to superiorly check the status.

      <title>Special Episode: Data on Kubernetes and Cassandra Forward with Patrick McFadin</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This special episode of Open||Source||Data features an interview with Patrick McFadin. Patrick has been a distributed systems hacker since he first plugged a modem into his Atari computer. Looking for adventure, he joined the US Navy, working on the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS), which cemented his love of distributed systems. He is now an Apache Cassandra Committer, and is the Vice President of Developer Relations at DataStax. </p><p>Sam catches up with Patrick at Data Day Texas to discuss his book <i>Managing Cloud Native Data on Kubernetes</i>, Cassandra Forward, and the future of Apache Cassandra.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“I can now use my Parquet file in Iceberg or DuckDB, and this is data that I created with Cassandra.

      <title>Workflow Engines and Building a Domain Specific Language for Data Quality with Tom Baeyens</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Tom Baeyens, Co-founder and CTO of Soda, where he oversees the company's product development, software architecture, and technology strategy. He is passionate about open source and committed to building a community where data engineers can succeed using the Soda Data Monitoring Platform. Tom is the inventor of the widely-used open source project jBPM and Activiti.

Prior to founding Coiled, Matthew worked on Dask at Anaconda and then NVIDIA where his teams focused on accelerating Dask through parallel computing and GPUs.

You were thinking about all these different tools and technologies and I was talking to someone once, it's like, ‘Oh, it's like you're standing on the shoulders of giants.’ That's not quite right. There's lots of sort of normal size people all standing on each other's shoulders in like a massive pyramid. [...] Dask was designed to scale up an existing ecosystem. There's a legacy Python ecosystem that’ll provide a layer of parallel computing on top of it. You can do that either by rewriting the whole thing, which is not feasible, or you can do it by talking to lots of people and getting them to integrate in interesting, fun ways. That's actually been the fun parts of Dask. I think I've probably talked to every major maintainer group ever. I have worked with them to find out the ways to get everything to work smoothly together. And that's super fun.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Indu Navar, CEO and Founder of EverythingALS, a patient-driven non-profit, bringing technological innovations and data science to support efforts from care to cure, for people with ALS.

So, it's a patient-driven, open innovation. So, once you do open patient-driven, open innovation, now we are the custodians of the data. Patients own the data, so all the data is shared with the patient. That was not done before in any of the research. And so, we give all the data back to the patients. And of course, we give them metrics as well. What was the rate of their speed of their speech? And if they don't want to see it, it's fine, at least they have it. And that data, we are the custodians and as custodians we share the data. So, once we did this model, we got almost close to one thousand people enrolled, consented, within 16 months.

Tony is a serial entrepreneur and inventor with a profound history in fraud, security, and SaaS business.

And, that to me, is extremely exciting.

The open source ecosystem is this amazing, decentralized, distributed store of human knowledge that encapsulates all these algorithms and data structures and systems that are then pulled into all these systems that we rely on in our lives. And, so far, no one has really tried to map that web of knowledge in the same way that Google has mapped the internet and we want to do that.

If it's just a whole bunch of data but it hasn't been labeled, if it hasn't been managed and produced, turned into a product. How do you understand its heritage?

      <title>Accelerating Computation, Machine Learning, and Data Mesh with Sophie Watson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Sophie Watson, Technical Product Marketing Manager at NVIDIA. Previously, Sophie served as a software engineer and principal data scientist at RedHat where she used machine learning to solve business problems in the hybrid cloud. Sophie has a PhD in Bayesian statistics and frequently speaks about machine learning workflows on Kubernetes, recommendation engines, and machine learning for search. </p><p>In this episode, Sam and Sophie discuss Principal Component Analysis, computational acceleration, and MLOps.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“We all start when we get hold of a data set by visualizing it to try to understand it. So that usually for me involves starting with a simple technique, something like PCA, Principal Component Analysis. It's been around since the eighties, probably longer, maybe the sixties. Don't quote me on that. With Principal Component Analysis, we can map our high dimensional data down to a smaller number of dimensions. Let's map it down to two so that we can visualize it. So we can go ahead and visualize it. But Principal Component Analysis is quite a simple technique in what it's doing and it's just mapping onto key components of our data. We might not be able to see, perhaps, separation of classes if we're working with data that's from a set of classes. Maybe we're looking at transactions, are they fraudulent or are they legitimate? And we might not be able to see that distinction. So that makes us think, "Is there something interesting in my data? Am I going to be able to train a machine learning model?" I don't know. Back in the day, I think the next step would've been, “Oh, let's train a model in C”, but now with accelerated compute within a really reasonable amount of time, we can go ahead and use a more sophisticated technique so we can use something like UMAP that's leaning on differential manifolds to do that projection to lower dimensions. And because this technique is slightly more sophisticated, what we find in general is that within the same amount of time, we're able to get more insight into the data. We're able to see the distinction in classes between our data sets. It keeps you in that loop. It keeps you in that productivity state.” – Sophie Watson</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(01:22): What open source data means to Sophie</p><p>(02:47): How Sophie is spending her time </p><p>(07:52): What excites Sophia about the data science community</p><p>(10:13): What Sophie is most excited about in data visibility</p><p>(16:29): Data on servers versus data in the cloud</p><p>(18:09): Accelerated computation on machine learning</p><p>(22:27): Sophie breaks down probabilistic programming</p><p>(24:21): What problem was Sophie trying to solve in her career</p><p>(32:12): Sophie’s dream job of working for Taylor Swift</p><p>(34:48): Sophie’s advice for those interested in open source</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophwats/">LinkedIn - Connect with Sophie</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sophwats">Twitter - Follow Sophie</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nvidia?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter - Follow NVIDIA</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">NVIDIA</a></p>

      <title>Vector Search, the AI Stack and more with Bob van Luijt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Bob van Luijt, CEO and Co-Founder of SeMI Technologies and co-creator of Weaviate, an open source vector search engine. </p><p>At just 15 years of age, Bob started his own software company in the Netherlands. He went on to study music at ArtEZ University of the Arts and Berklee College of Music, and completed the Harvard Business School Program of Management Excellence. Bob is also a TedX speaker, discussing the relationship between software and language.</p><p>In this episode, Sam sits down with Bob to break down vector search, the AI-first ecosystem, and how music and software relate to one another.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“I dare to argue that from the two big waves in database technology that we've seen, so first, in the seventies and eighties with SQL. And then the whole NoSQL wave that we have seen and the big winners that are in there, I dare to argue that we see a third wave coming up. And the third wave, I simply call it AI-first. And what I mean with that is that these models play an important role. So we do it from the perspective of the models first. And in that new segment, you see four niches. So the first niche that we see are what I like to call the embedding providers. The Hugging Faces of this world, the OpenAIs of this world, etc. Those who bring us the embeddings that we need to do the vectorization. Then secondly, we have so-called neural search frameworks. So we see frameworks like Haystack and Jina. Then third, we have the feature stores. So the feature stores take care of storing large chunks of features that we later can use to do vectorization on those kinds of things.And then we have the search engines. And Weaviate is an example of such a search engine that takes care of searching through data on a large scale that is vectorized.It might be a bold statement, but I really believe that we see this third wave of database technology happening.” – Bob van Luijt</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(01:45): How Bob defines open source data </p><p>(04:09): What is a vector database and why do we need them? </p><p>(07:55): How data is different before and after vectorization</p><p>(13:58): Orders of magnitude faster or personal</p><p>(16:09): How music and software relate to each other for Bob</p><p>(19:33): Bob’s inspiration behind Weaviate</p><p>(25:02): The AI-first ecosystem</p><p>(27:38): The distinction between vector search engines, feature stores, neural search frameworks, and embedding </p><p>(32:28): Bob’s advice for folks on the OSS startup journey</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobvanluijt/?originalSubdomain=nl" target="_blank">LinkedIn - Connect with Bob</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/bobvanluijt" target="_blank">Twitter - Follow Bob</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/weaviate_io" target="_blank">Twitter - Follow Weaviate</a></p><p><a href="https://weaviate.io/" target="_blank">Weaviate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.semi.technology/" target="_blank">SeMI Technologies</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bob_van_luijt_digital_technology_through_the_lens_of_language" target="_blank">Bob’s TedX Talk</a></p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/23/the-ai-first-database-ecosystem/amp/">Bob's Forbes Article on the AI-First Database Ecosystem</a></p>

      <title>Open Source Innovation, The GPL for Data, and The Data In to Data Out Ratio with Larry Augustin</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Larry Augustin, angel investor and advisor to early-stage technology companies. Larry previously served as the Vice President for Applications at AWS, where he was responsible for application services like Pinpoint, Chime, and WorkSpaces.</p><p>Before joining AWS, Larry was the CEO of SugarCRM, an open source CRM vendor. He also was the founder and CEO of VA Linux, where he launched SourceForge. Among the group who coined the term “open source”, Larry has sat on the boards of several open source and Linux organizations.</p><p>In this episode, Sam and Larry discuss who owns the rights to data, the data in to data out ratio, and why Larry is an open source titan.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>"People are willing to give up so much of their personal information because they get an awful lot back. And privacy experts come along and say, ‘Well, you're taking all this personal information’. But then most people look at that and say, ‘But I get a lot of value back out of that.’ And it's this data ratio value question, which is: for a little in, I get a lot back. That becomes a key element in this. And I think there has to be some kind of similar thought process around open source data in general, which is if I contribute some data into this, I'm going to get a lot of value back. So this data in to data out ratio, I think it's an incredibly important one. It's a principle that I drive into application development. If you put a user in front of an app and they start using the app, you're going to ask them for things. And my principle is always, ‘How do you figure out how to never ask them and only give them?’ And you can't get 100% of the way there, but every time it's like, ‘Why did you ask them for that? Couldn't you figure it out?’ And it gets everyone in the mindset of, ‘How do I provide more and more and take less and less?’ It's a principle of application development that I like a lot. And I think there's a similar concept here around open-source data. Are there models or structures that we can come up with where people can contribute small amounts of data and as a result of that, they get back a lot of value.” – Larry Augustin</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Episode Timestamps:</strong></p><p>(02:14): How Larry is spending his time after AWS</p><p>(06:01): What drove Larry to open source</p><p>(18:04): What is the GPL for data?</p><p>(23:51): Areas of progress in open source data</p><p>(28:37): The data in to data out ratio</p><p>(36:02): Larry’s advice for folks in open source</p><p>-------------------</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/larryaugustin/">LinkedIn - Connect with Larry</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/lmaugustin">Twitter - Follow Larry</a></p>

Now, instead of bringing the data into the engines, you’re actually bringing the engines to the data. So you have this open data tier built on open source technology. The data is represented in open source formats and stored in the company’s S3 account or Azure storage account. And then you can use a variety of engines. We at Dremio, we take pride in building the best SQL engine to use on the data. There are different streaming engines, like Spark and Flink. There are different batch processing and machine learning engines. Spark is an example of that as well that companies can use on that same data.

      <title>Interoperability, Governance, and Divergent Teams with Prukalpa Sankar</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Prukalpa Sankar, Co-Founder of Atlan. Atlan is a venture-backed startup building a modern data workspace. Prukalpa also co-founded SocialCops, a data for good company behind landmark projects such as India’s National Data Platform. Prukalpa is a recognized industry leader, landing on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list and Fortune’s 40 Under 40.</p><p>In this episode, Prukalpa and Sam discuss how diversity is a data team’s biggest strength, why governance isn’t always a bad thing, and what they hope the modern data stack will look like in 5 years.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>“Diversity is our biggest strength but our biggest weakness, because it's really hard to make that team collaborate. Because most of the teams in the world are very uniform.

      <title>Trust, Automation, and Trade-Offs with Joseph Jacks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features an interview with Joseph Jacks, Founder and General Partner of OSS Capital. OSS Capital is the first and only COSS (Commercial Open Source Software) company investor that focuses on supporting early-stage COSS founders. Joseph, also known as JJ, has worked at Mesosphere, TIBCO Software, and Talend in various sales, engineering, and strategy roles.</p>
<p>In this episode, JJ and Sam weigh the trade-offs of open and closed core companies and discuss how each can go public. JJ also dives into the misconception of trust equating privacy within tech.</p>

<p>[25:14]: “There’s a societal recognition that if you use technology to automate some part of your life and you use that regularly, you have to be able to trust it. And I think gradually, consumers are becoming more and more aware that one of the most effective ways of checking the trust box is answering the question, ‘Is the technology I'm using open source at the core, yes or no?’ And if the answer is no, I think it's very difficult and a lot harder to achieve the levels of trust that you can if the answer is yes.” – Joseph Jacks</p>
