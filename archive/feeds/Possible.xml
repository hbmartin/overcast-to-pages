    <description>What if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Possible is an award-winning, weekly podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Hosts Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger explore what’s possible with forward-thinking leaders, deep thinkers, and ambitious builders across many fields, such as technology, art, education and healthcare. These conversations center on the ways technology—and, in particular, AI—is shaping the future. In episodes, AI tools such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Inflection’s Pi are at work, offering informational asides, prompting guests, or demoing what they can do. Lastly, between guest episodes, Aria interviews her co-host Reid on his latest takes on what’s possible if we use technology—and our collective effort—effectively.</description>

      <title>Yuval Noah Harari on trust, the dangers of AI, power, and revolutions</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What will it take to create AI that is as trustworthy, if not more trustworthy than humans? 



This week, Reid and Aria sit down with Yuval Noah Harari, historian, philosopher, and best-selling author of several books including Nexus, Sapiens and Homo Deus. When it comes to outlook on AI, Yuval, Reid, and Aria agree on the importance of building both human trust in AI and AI that is genuinely truth-seeking, but they differ on how possible it is to achieve. 



Together, they dig into their diverging opinions on the outcomes of the AI revolution, global cooperation, and how AI will learn from humans. They also discuss the differences between intelligence and consciousness, and whether conscious AI is a goal worth pursuing. 



Yuval turns to history to ground his warnings about AI. Even though he’s cautious about technology, he is critical of cynicism. Yuval shares his philosophy on human compassion as a guiding principle that can allow us to steer away from collapse and ultimately, build a better AI future.

Tune in for grounded and speculative takes on how technology—and, in particular, AI—is inspiring change and transforming the future. Hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, each episode features an interview with an ambitious builder or deep thinker on a topic, from art to geopolitics and from healthcare to education. These conversations also showcase another kind of guest: AI. Each episode seeks to enhance and advance our discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology—and our collective effort—effectively.</p>]]>

      <title> Reid riffs on PBCs, jobs and automation, and AI access for kids</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>Reid breaks down OpenAI’s shift to a public benefit corporation—what it really means, why it matters, and why some critics are missing the point. Aria asks whether all frontier AI companies should follow suit. Reid and Aria discuss how educators can navigate the “messy middle” of AI in the classroom. They also dig into the future of assessment, what students (and job seekers) should be learning now to prepare for an AI future, and whether AI-intensive fields are worth the bet.

      <title>Jane Goodall on Hope, AI, and the Natural World </title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What would it look like to keep all living creatures in the loop on the development of new technology?



Reid sat down for a wide-ranging solo discussion with Jane Goodall on that very subject – and more. They talked about how to maintain hope and focus on local impact in today’s often chaotic world, how technology – and AI in particular – might be helpful for conservation, and Jane’s global youth program, Roots &amp; Shoots. Plus, the Jane Goodall institute shared audio from a cutting edge acoustic array that helped them discover a brand new species in Gombe National Park in Tanzania! Jane reflected on her legacy and shared stories about bridging unlikely divides, defying the scientific community early in her career, young people opening their eyes to the natural world for the first time, and so much more.



Thank you to the incredible team at the Jane Goodall Institute and WildMon (L. Pintea, B. Wallauer, K. Harmon, M. Campos, Gabriel Leite, Tomaz Melo, Guilherme Melo, D. A. Collins, D. C. Mjungu) that, with funding from Google, utilized an acoustic array to discover brand new species in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, including Thomas’s Dwarf Galago (Galagoides thomasi).

      <description>Reid weighs in on the U.S. government’s latest antitrust action against Google and what it could mean for competition, innovation, and America’s tech edge. Aria also asks about the rise of Chinese electric vehicles and why BYD might be “the Tesla of tomorrow;” the geopolitical costs of tariffs; and whether saying “please” and “thank you” to ChatGPT is worth it.

      <title>Derek Thompson on AI, abundance, and human progress</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>Why can the United States government help make a vaccine in a year but not build a high-speed train in a reasonable timeframe? What if our biggest problems—affordable housing shortages, energy limits, and scientific slowdowns—aren’t inevitable, but chosen?

This week, Reid and Aria sit down with Derek Thompson—staff writer at The Atlantic and host of the podcast Plain English—to explore how a scarcity mindset is holding American society back. They cover how AI can revolutionize scientific discovery; what Operation Warp Speed got right; and why real progress depends on bold policy, not just better technology. Plus, Reid joins Derek in the hotseat for some “Too Much, Too Little, or Just Right?”—a game co-created with ChatGPT to discuss ideas in Derek’s new best-selling book, Abundance.

      <title>Reid riffs on Tobi’s memo, AI and play, and the tweet that cost trillions</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>After Tobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, put out a memo stating all his employees should be expected to use AI every day, Reid offers his thoughts on AI in the workplace. He also talks about the interplay between AI, social media, mis/disinformation, and the importance of shaping technology instead of restricting technology. Plus, Reid speculates on how AI can be just as groundbreaking in the world of play as it can be in the world of work.

      <title>Demis Hassabis on AI, game theory, multimodality, and the nature of creativity</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>How can AI help us understand and master deeply complex systems—from the game Go, which has 10 to the power 170 possible positions a player could pursue, or proteins, which, on average, can fold in 10 to the power 300 possible ways? This week, Reid and Aria are joined by Demis Hassabis. Demis is a British artificial intelligence researcher, co-founder, and CEO of the AI company, DeepMind. Under his leadership, DeepMind developed Alpha Go, the first AI to defeat a human world champion in Go and later created AlphaFold, which solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. He's considered one of the most influential figures in AI. Demis, Reid, and Aria discuss game theory, medicine, multimodality, and the nature of innovation and creativity.

      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>How can we use AI to amplify human potential and build a better future? And what exactly does “AGI” even mean? 

To kick off Possible’s fourth season, Reid and Aria sit down with world-renowned computer scientist Fei-Fei Li, whose work in artificial intelligence over the past several decades has earned her the nickname “the godmother of AI.” An entrepreneur and professor, Fei-Fei shares her journey from creating ImageNet, a massive dataset of labeled images that revolutionized computer vision, to her current role as co-founder and CEO of the spatial intelligence startup World Labs. She explains why spatial intelligence—the ability to perceive and interact with the 3D world—is so crucial for AI's development and how it could lead to breakthroughs in fields like medicine, climate, and education. They get into regulatory guardrails, governance, and what it will take to build a positive, human-centered AI future for all.

      <title>PRESENTING: Pioneers of AI with Dr. Rana El Kaliouby and Musician Taryn Southern</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>Pioneers of AI is your weekly guide to the AI frontier. Each week, host Dr. Rana el Kaliouby (AI scientist, investor, author, co-founder of Affectiva) is joined by the leading creators, critics, and thinkers behind mind-blowing technology and asks the important questions about how artificial intelligence is changing the way we live.

In this episode: Creating and sharing art is a uniquely human experience. With the rise of AI, creative processes are shifting, but Taryn Southern doesn’t think that means art becomes any less human. As a storyteller and technologist, Southern uses AI to push the limits of her creativity. She also works to help fellow artists and everyday people embrace the potential of AI. Southern joins Pioneers of AI to talk about what partnering with AI to make art looks like, how she assembled a team of chatbots to create a festival trailer, and what it was like making the first album co-written by AI.

      <title>Artful Intelligence | Ep 3: Paul Trillo on Music Video x AI</title>
      <description>What does it take to create something the world has never seen before?
In this final episode of Artful Intelligence, Reid Hoffman and Chris McLeod explore what it takes to spark a creative revolution with filmmaker Paul Trillo. Using OpenAI’s groundbreaking AI video generator, Sora, Paul directed the world’s first fully AI-generated music video. 
After gaining early access to Sora, Paul faced a massive creative challenge: How could he use an AI tool known for surreal, dream-like visuals to craft a music video that felt emotionally real? The answer came from embracing AI’s quirks—its strange hallucinations, its unpredictable transformations—and writing prompts like poetic scripts to guide the machine’s creative output.
Join us as Paul reveals how he turned an experimental AI model into an award-winning music video—and how creators everywhere can harness emerging tech to redefine what’s possible in art.

      <title>Introducing: Artful Intelligence | Ep 1: Malick Lombion on Hyperlapse x AI</title>
      <description>What if you could create the impossible with AI?
In this debut episode of Artful Intelligence, Chris McLeod introduces us to Montreal-based filmmaker Malick Lombion, whose groundbreaking technique, Hyperlapse X AI, is redefining video art. Malick combines hyperlapse cinematography with cutting-edge AI tools like DALL-E to compress time, space, and reality into surreal and mesmerizing visuals.
Malick pushed AI to its creative limits, proving that human ingenuity and machine learning can work in tandem to unlock new dimensions of art. Reid Hoffman and Chris explore what it takes to innovate at this level: the right partnerships, a willingness to fail publicly, and a commitment to going all in.
Discover how Malick’s work inspired a new wave of video creators—and what it says about the future of creativity in an AI-driven world.

      <itunes:summary>What if you could create the impossible with AI?
In this debut episode of Artful Intelligence, Chris McLeod introduces us to Montreal-based filmmaker Malick Lombion, whose groundbreaking technique, Hyperlapse X AI, is redefining video art. Malick combines hyperlapse cinematography with cutting-edge AI tools like DALL-E to compress time, space, and reality into surreal and mesmerizing visuals.
Malick pushed AI to its creative limits, proving that human ingenuity and machine learning can work in tandem to unlock new dimensions of art. Reid Hoffman and Chris explore what it takes to innovate at this level: the right partnerships, a willingness to fail publicly, and a commitment to going all in.
Discover how Malick’s work inspired a new wave of video creators—and what it says about the future of creativity in an AI-driven world.

      <title>Devshi Mehrotra on AI, justice, and public defense</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>America’s criminal justice system relies on public defenders to represent anyone without access to a private attorney. But public defenders are chronically under-resourced and overburdened with caseloads. Can technology help lessen that load and, in effect, make the criminal justice system more just? This week’s guest, Devshi Mehrotra, says yes. Devshi is co-founder and CEO of JusticeText, a startup developing AI software to help lawyers search and review case material more efficiently and enhance police accountability. She joins Reid and Aria to talk about JusticeText’s offerings and opportunities, along with public-private partnerships and local governments’ evolving attitudes toward AI and innovation. Plus, a public defender shares her experience using JusticeText and Devshi demos the platform.

      <title>Bill Gates on possibility, AI, and humanity</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>How many lives will be saved with the help of AI over the next decade?
Reid and Aria sat down with Bill Gates to discuss his main areas of focus: climate change, energy, global health, and education—and how AI will help transform each of them. Taking a bird’s-eye view of society’s challenges, it’s easy to give in to pessimism. But as one of the most influential people in the world, Bill Gates has a unique perspective on how far humanity has come and what our potential—and timelines—for meaningful change really look like. He gets granular on everything from cows (5% of global emissions) to disease reduction and eradication (Guinea worm disease). At each turn, he has data at his fingertips to ground his beliefs. So, what current set of innovations is Bill most excited about? And what is realistically on the horizon for AI, climate change, energy, global health, and education?

Possible is an award-winning podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Most of all, it asks: what if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Tune in for grounded and speculative takes on how technology—and, in particular, AI—is inspiring change and transforming the future. Hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, each episode features an interview with an ambitious builder or deep thinker on a topic, from art to geopolitics and from healthcare to education. These conversations also showcase another kind of guest: AI. Whether it's Inflection’s Pi, OpenAI’s ChatGPT or other AI tools, each episode will use AI to enhance and advance our discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology—and our collective effort—effectively.</description>

      <title>Sean White on Inflection and AI frontiers</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>How will an empathetic AI interact with humans? What if we used AI not just for its IQ, but its EQ? How do we build the trust to enable it to take agency on our behalf?

This week, Reid and Aria sit down with an expert and friend, Sean White to start answering those questions. Sean White is currently the CEO of Inflection AI and is working on expanding the relationship of what AI can do for humans. Sean takes a humanist approach to new technology, and is interested in AI that can go beyond intelligence to learn empathy and take action. Sean's background is as wide-ranging as the conversation, where we discuss the influence of AI in everything from neuroscience to understanding animal languages. Plus, listen to a live test with Pi to demonstrate Pi's ability to handle a tough situation at work, with empathy.

      <title>Sarah Longwell on politics, AI, and elections</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What’s driving some of the greatest political divisions and threats to democracy ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election?
This week, Reid and Aria attempt to unpack this with someone who specializes in listening to American voters and translating those insights, at scale: Republican political strategist and The Bulwark co-founder/publisher Sarah Longwell. Sarah, who also hosts The Focus Group Podcast, joins the show to talk about her experience listening to everyday voters through focus groups — and her perspective on how doing so can help people better understand one another, combat misinformation, and heal some of the deepest divides in America today. She shares her perspective on Donald Trump, the upcoming election, the state of politics in Silicon Valley, AI, the future of the Republican Party, and the value of compromising. Plus, Reid tests GPT-4o’s ability to separate fact from fiction. 
Note: This conversation is not intended to proselytize or convert anyone. Rather, it is an attempt to learn from someone who has spent hundreds of hours talking to thousands of voters about their lives and politics.

      <description>Reid talks about why he invested in California Forever, the ambitious sustainable city project in Solano County, California.

      <title>Jan Sramek on California Forever and the future of cities</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if we could build the ideal sustainable city from scratch? This week’s guest is aiming to do that, and he has unique insight into what making that dream a reality can look like. Jan Sramek is the founder of California Forever, a company aiming to build an affordable, urban community in Solano County, California. Reid—an investor in California Forever—and Aria sat down with Jan to talk about the vision for the city, where it draws inspiration from, and some of the controversy that has sprung up around the initiative since it was announced in 2023. Why build a new city rather than developing existing ones? How will this new city be connected to the surrounding community? And when might the first residents be able to move in?

      <title>Reid riffs on coding and K-12 education </title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What will being a software engineer look like in the future, when the predominant coding language is English—or whatever language you speak—instead of JavaScript? In this episode, Reid reflects on his own education, including the value of studying philosophy. Plus, he shares what he’d prioritize in designing kids' classroom experiences today and gets into AI’s potential to help customize lessons to align with students’ curiosities and learning styles.

      <title>Pat Yongpradit on AI literacy and computer science education</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What does AI literacy mean for students and their teachers? Code.org Chief Academic Officer Pat Yongpradit—himself a former middle school computer science teacher—joins Reid and Aria for the first-ever live-taping of Possible, recorded at the ASU+GSV Summit in San Diego. 

In this episode, they discuss why school-wide bans on AI are a terrible idea and what “always be learning” refers to in an age of AI. Plus, Pat unveils, for the first time publicly, Code.org’s newest tool for teachers: an AI assistant that helps computer science teachers grade assignments.

      <title>BONUS: Reid Hoffman’s speech: Humanity’s Hegelian Golden Braid</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What should we keep in mind as we venture into this new AI era? Reid Hoffman delivers a speech, entitled Humanity’s Hegelian Golden Braid, to address this question. The speech offers six guiding maxims related to AI, humanity, and technology—and weaves through Hegel and Hofstadter, cathedrals and griffins, T.S. Elliot and Hyman Minsky, and more.

This speech was originally given by Reid Hoffman in English on May 24, 2024 after accepting an honorary doctorate from the University of Perugia. It’s also been translated and delivered by REID AI (an AI version of Reid Hoffman) in nine different languages. For videos of those translated speeches delivered by REID AI, a transcript of the speech in English, and more, please visit: https://www.reidhoffman.org/perugia-speech.</description>

Topics:
3:30 - Hellos and intros
3:54 - Technology that makes Kara optimistic
6:40 - Technology to solve climate change
8:43 - Why health-tech and climate tech inspire optimism
10:09 - State of the media landscape
15:34 - Can smaller-scale media work?
16:56 - Pi weighs in on Patrick Soon-Shiong
19:33 - How will AI impact media misinformation
22:27 - Impact of AI in politics
27:52 - Kara’s latest book
30:36 - Is AI training “stealing”?
37:28 - TikTok ban
42:51 - A question for Reid: Is TikTok worth buying?
45:43 - How to shape capitalism
51:30 - Rapid-fire questions

What if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Possible is an award-winning, weekly podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Hosts Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger explore what’s possible with forward-thinking leaders, deep thinkers, and ambitious builders across many fields, such as technology, art, education and healthcare. These conversations center on the ways technology—and, in particular, AI—is shaping the future. In episodes, AI tools such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Inflection’s Pi are at work, offering informational asides, prompting guests, or demoing what they can do. Lastly, between guest episodes, Aria interviews her co-host Reid on his latest takes on what’s possible if we use technology—and our collective effort—effectively.</description>

What if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Possible is an award-winning, weekly podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Hosts Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger explore what’s possible with forward-thinking leaders, deep thinkers, and ambitious builders across many fields, such as technology, art, education and healthcare. These conversations center on the ways technology—and, in particular, AI—is shaping the future. In episodes, AI tools such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Inflection’s Pi are at work, offering informational asides, prompting guests, or demoing what they can do. Lastly, between guest episodes, Aria interviews her co-host Reid on his latest takes on what’s possible if we use technology—and our collective effort—effectively.</itunes:summary>

      <title>[BONUS + VIDEO] Reid interviews Reid AI, his AI avatar</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>Reid recently created an AI version of himself—REID AI—and recorded a video Q&amp;A to see how this digital twin might challenge him in new ways. Watch the full clip here: https://youtu.be/rgD2gmwCS10

This is Reid’s latest AI experiment, following the book he co-wrote with GPT-4 (Impromptu), the podcast he co-hosted with ChatGPT (Fireside Chatbots), and, of course, Possible, in which we use AI tools like Pi and GPT-4 to prompt guests and enrich conversations. 

Possible returns next week, but in the meantime, we thought you might like to watch and learn more about Reid’s latest experiment with AI tools.

Watch the full clip: https://youtu.be/rgD2gmwCS10

The backstory on making REID AI in Reid’s newsletter: https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/long-reids-6953437305957232640/

Lastly, the video avatar is generated by Hour One, and its voice was created by 11ElevenLabs. 

Hour One - https://app.hourone.ai/home
11ElevenLabs - https://elevenlabs.io/

REID AI’s persona—the way that it formulates responses—is generated from a custom chatbot built on GPT-4 that was trained on Reid’s books, speeches, podcasts and other content that Reid has produced over the last few decades. 

This video is fully endorsed by Reid Hoffman.</description>

      <title>Katherine Maher on the future of trusted information</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What would it take for AI to become as trusted a source of information as Wikipedia? 

Katherine Maher, former CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, joins the show to talk about the fundamental building blocks of trust behind Wikipedia. 

The use of AI will fundamentally reshape what information is distributed on the internet—and how. Reid, Aria, and Katherine talk about what creating and scaling positive spaces and community-driven ideas online would look like in the context of AI. 

Could in-text citation be a viable option for generative AI? What was Wikipedia’s response to being used as training data for AI models? Globally, the West currently appears far less optimistic about AI than the rest of the world. They discuss that cost and more.

      <link>https://www.possible.fm/podcast/</link>
      <description>What would it look like to build coalitions to disrupt poverty, pollution, and the prison system? This week’s guest received a $100 million grant to do just that.

How can underserved communities better contribute their talent and resources? And how can we change our news, media, and even sci-fi comic books to reflect a better future?

      <title>Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins on the future of social welfare</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What does it look like to build true access with technology? Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, CEO and co-founder of Promise, is creating that reality. She sat down with Reid and Aria to discuss how her company is revolutionizing the way people receive welfare in its client states. By leveraging data, questioning preconceived assumptions, and focusing on eliminating bias, Promise has become a model for socially conscious business. This people-first mindset runs so deep that Promise employees personally call clients to apologize for mistakes. Phaedra also uses her high-level view of social systems and business to consider how AI could close access gaps and improve life for the most marginalized.

      <title>Feed Drop: Masters of Scale | Reid Hoffman confronts the AI critics</title>
      <link>https://listen.mastersofscale.com/Possible</link>
      <description>Hey listeners! Possible is off this week but we’re bringing you an episode from another podcast hosted by Reid called Masters of Scale. 

Questions in this episode include: Are AI’s harshest critics causing irreversible harm to humanity? How far should leaders lean into AI? And just what would Reid sound like speaking Chinese with a British accent?

Reid Hoffman sits down with CEO of WaitWhat and longtime friend Jeff Berman to tackle these pressing questions and more. Join them in an unguarded exploration of how the AI landscape has continued to shift in the six months since Reid published Impromptu, the book he co-authored with GPT-4.

Reid also gives a sneak peek into his work with Microsoft's research-only, commercially unreleased AI text-to-speech tech, and discusses why he chose not to join Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and other tech leaders in signing an open letter warning about the existential threat of AI.

This episode was produced by the team at Masters of Scale, the award-winning business podcast hosted by Reid Hoffman. In each episode of Masters of Scale, Reid joins iconic business leaders to unpack their scale journeys, delving into the moments—and mindsets—behind their success.

      <title>Siddhartha Mukherjee on the future of disease and diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>Will artificial intelligence change what it means to be human? Cancer physician, researcher, and author Siddhartha Mukherjee joins the podcast to help rethink how we understand human health—and the ways AI can help. Sid talks about using AI to emancipate patients from disease as well as enhance patient health and wellbeing. He also discusses the risks that come along with incorporating AI into the medical world and how new technologies in medicine are ushering in a “new human.” Plus, Sid and Reid pose a thought exercise: if there were five spots on a spaceship about to be sent off to restart humanity, which professions would get those seats?

The award-winning Possible podcast is back with a new season that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Most of all, it asks: what if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Tune in for grounded and speculative takes on how technology—and, in particular, AI—is inspiring change and transforming the future. 

This season, hosts Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, are speaking with a new set of ambitious builders and deep thinkers about everything from art to geopolitics and from healthcare to education.

      <title>Condoleezza Rice on the future of war and geopolitics </title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>How will artificial intelligence reshape diplomacy and war? Renowned diplomat and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joins the show to explore that question. As director of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a member of the board of directors of C3 AI, Dr. Rice is at the intersection of our geopolitical climate and the advancement of AI. Reid, Aria, and Dr. Rice explore the options for global collaboration in the AI space, how to legislate around AI to prioritize safety without squashing innovation, and the role AI might soon play in foreign affairs. The possibilities for AI in diplomacy are exciting. Where might it assist and amplify the work of officials and diplomats? Dr. Rice shares the story of a tense, private moment with a Russian diplomat that could make or break a war – and Inflection’s Pi chimes in for some context.

      <title>Socially assistive robots with Maja Matarić [AI miniseries]</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if we each had a personal “buddy” to support us? Maja Mataric is a computer scientist, roboticist and AI researcher at the University of Southern California. She pioneered the field of socially assistive robotics: the design of robots to help humans—especially vulnerable people such as kids with autism, the elderly, and people struggling with illness—navigate complicated social needs. In the second episode of our AI miniseries, Maja, Reid, and Aria discuss AI, robots and our future with both. Throughout her career, Maja has sought to understand human needs and desires in order to create the right kind of robot. How big should it be? Should it be a humanoid? Animal? Or… WALL-E? These questions lead to the nature of empathy itself—and what it means for robots to be empathetic. Maja also responds to an AI-generated story that speculates on the role that a socially assistive robot could play for a multigenerational family.

The conversation also features another kind of guest: GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most powerful language model to date. Each episode has a companion story, generated by GPT-4, which will serve as a jumping-off point for a hopeful, speculative discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology—and our collective effort—effectively.

Possible is produced by Wonder Media Network and hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger. Our showrunner is Shaun Young. Possible is produced by Edie Allard and Sara Schleede.

      <itunes:summary>What if we could commute to space for work? Or rest and relax in a floating pod, immersed in a galaxy? Such easy access to space might not be as far away as we think. This week, Reid and Aria sit down with Ariel Ekblaw, director of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative and founding CEO of Aurelia Institute. Ariel talks about democratizing access to space and using advancements in space technology to improve life on earth, now and in the future. Her goal isn’t just to make life in space possible, but to make it worth living, with culture and art. Plus, Ariel reflects on GPT-4 stories that speculate on space technologies that can enhance life on Earth.

      <title>Jaime Teevan on the future of work</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if we had a copilot for every profession? Or if we had the capability to create digital clones of ourselves to pursue our creative projects? These prospects aren’t too far-fetched thanks to the latest developments in AI. What does the future of work actually look like? This week, Reid and Aria sat down with Jaime Teevan, Chief Scientist and Technical Fellow at Microsoft, and former technical advisor to CEO Satya Nadella. Leading Microsoft’s Future of Work Initiative, Jaime explores how everything from AI to hybrid work changes the way people get things done. Together, Jaime and our hosts discuss how we might best use AI, get a lot done with microtasks, and reimagine measures of productivity. Plus, GPT-4 and special guest stars share some neat stats and hot takes on the future of work.

      <title>Bryan Stevenson on the future of criminal justice</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if, instead of punishing people who made mistakes, we helped them? Bryan Stevenson, founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has spent his career working toward a more equitable and restorative criminal justice system. He joins Reid and Aria this week to discuss the root causes of mass incarceration in America and how we can build safe communities without excessive policing and sentencing. Bryan responds to GPT-4 stories that imagine how new technologies could prevent wrongful convictions and contribute to a better criminal justice system—but are the questions we ask still stuck in carceral logic?

Possible is a new podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Most of all, it asks: what if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, each episode features an interview with a visionary from a different field: climate science, media, criminal justice, and more. The conversation also features another kind of guest: GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most powerful language model to date. Each episode has a companion story, generated by GPT-4, which will serve as a jumping-off point for a hopeful, speculative discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology—and our collective effort—effectively.

Possible is produced by Wonder Media Network and hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger. Our showrunner is Shaun Young. Possible is produced by Edie Allard and Sara Schleede.

      <itunes:summary>What if, instead of punishing people who made mistakes, we helped them? Bryan Stevenson, founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has spent his career working toward a more equitable and restorative criminal justice system. He joins Reid and Aria this week to discuss the root causes of mass incarceration in America and how we can build safe communities without excessive policing and sentencing. Bryan responds to GPT-4 stories that imagine how new technologies could prevent wrongful convictions and contribute to a better criminal justice system—but are the questions we ask still stuck in carceral logic?

      <title>Janette Sadik-Khan on the future of cities</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if we didn’t need cars? Janette Sadik-Khan, former Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, helped revolutionize some of New York’s most famous streets into navigable, car-free areas. She joins the show this week to paint a picture of cities that put people first. How has the purpose of the city changed over time? Is it really possible—and preferable—to remove cars from cities altogether? And what does the future of cities really look like? Janette also responds to speculation about the future of transportation via GPT-4’s stories of how people might traverse Istanbul and Vietnam decades from now. It turns out, we might need a lot less new technology than we think to create the people-first cities of the future.

      <title>Saul Griffith on a clean energy future </title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if society completely phased out fossil fuels? This week, Saul Griffith joins the show to discuss how this future is actually possible. Best of all, much of the work can be done with our existing technology—starting from inside the home. Saul founded the organizations Rewiring America and Rewiring Australia, dedicated to the electrification of those countries. He’s also the author of Electrify: An Optimist's Playbook for Our Clean Energy Future and The Big Switch: Australia’s Electric Future. Saul talks about the efficacy of the variety of climate solutions on the table, from nuclear energy to carbon capture, and from geoengineering to his preferred method of electrification. GPT-4 also supplies a potential pathway to the complete electrification of society based on Saul’s book—but is it too fantastical? Or does it not go far enough?

      <itunes:summary>What if society completely phased out fossil fuels? This week, Saul Griffith joins the show to discuss how this future is actually possible. Best of all, much of the work can be done with our existing technology—starting from inside the home. Saul founded the organizations Rewiring America and Rewiring Australia, dedicated to the electrification of those countries. He’s also the author of Electrify: An Optimist's Playbook for Our Clean Energy Future and The Big Switch: Australia’s Electric Future. Saul talks about the efficacy of the variety of climate solutions on the table, from nuclear energy to carbon capture, and from geoengineering to his preferred method of electrification. GPT-4 also supplies a potential pathway to the complete electrification of society based on Saul’s book—but is it too fantastical? Or does it not go far enough?

Possible is a new podcast that sketches out the brightest version of the future—and what it will take to get there. Most of all, it asks: what if, in the future, everything breaks humanity's way? Hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger, each episode features an interview with a visionary from a different field: climate science, media, criminal justice, and more. The conversation also features another kind of guest: GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most powerful language model to date. Each episode has a companion story, generated by GPT-4, which will serve as a jumping-off point for a hopeful, speculative discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology—and our collective effort—effectively.

Possible is produced by Wonder Media Network and hosted by Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger. Our showrunner is Shaun Young. Possible is produced by Edie Allard and Sara Schleede. Jenny Kaplan is our Executive Producer and Editor. Special thanks to Nan Ransohoff, Christin Pelgrum, Surya Yalamanchili, Saida Sapeiva, Ian Alas, Greg Beato and Ben Relles.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Dr. Kim Budil on the future of fusion</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if there was a source of energy that was virtually inexhaustible, produced no greenhouse gasses, and generated minimal waste? Well, it already exists – almost. Reid and Aria sit down with Dr. Kim Budil, director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to talk about the future of fusion energy. Last December, Dr. Budil’s lab achieved fusion ignition. She explains what that historic breakthrough means, and what levers need to be pulled to go from that experiment to powering nations. Dr. Budil responds to stories, generated by GPT-4, about scaling fusion energy, plus another about how a country can transition to fusion energy in 2053.

      <title>Trevor Noah on the future of entertainment and AI</title>
      <link>https://www.possible.fm/</link>
      <description>What if every TV show could be perfectly tailored to each viewer's interests, knowledge level, and needs? Reid Hoffman and Aria Finger sit down with Trevor Noah to talk about how technology—including artificial intelligence—might influence the future of entertainment. They chat about the strengths and shortcomings of artificial intelligence, how jobs—and the way we will work—will evolve with AI, and even the nature of capitalism. Trevor responds to a speculative story, generated by GPT-4, that paints a picture of a futuristic “AI-ly Show.” Plus, he reviews some unexpected AI-generated light bulb jokes. Is GPT-4 actually funny?
