In this episode, Danielle Tal and Thilo Fromm join us to discuss Flatcar Linux. They introduce Flatcar as a Linux operating system designed specifically for containers and Kubernetes workloads, highlighting its automation, self-healing capabilities, and security features. They emphasize how Flatcar simplifies operations for startups and large companies alike by automating OS provisioning and maintenance. We discussed contributor engagement and the project's involvement with the CNCF. They also share intriguing use cases, like a Kubernetes cluster running on a tractor fleet, and stress the importance of community contributions, not just in code but in evangelism and documentation.

In this episode, Michael Lieberman, Co-founder and CTO of Kusari, walks us through the intersection of open source software and security. We discuss Mike's extensive involvement in OpenSSF projects like SLSA and GUAC, which provide essential frameworks for securing the software development life cycle (SDLC) and managing software supply chains. He explains how these tools help verify software provenance and manage vulnerabilities. Additionally, we explore regulatory concerns such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the vital role of the recently released Open SSF Security Baseline (OSPS Baseline) in helping organizations comply with such regulations. Mike also shares insights into the evolution of open source security practices, the importance of reducing complexity for developers, and the potential benefits of orchestrating security similarly to Kubernetes. We conclude with a look at upcoming projects and current pilots aiming to simplify and enhance open source security.

Alex Scammon: Currently, I'm leading a large and intrepid band of open-source engineers engaged in a number of philanthropic upstream contributions on behalf of G-Research. All of our work centers around open-source data science and machine learning tools and the MLOps and HPC infrastructure to support those tools at scale. We're almost certainly hiring.... As part of this work, I'm also leading a discussion around batch scheduling on Kubernetes as the chair of the CNCF's Batch Working Group. Please reach out if this is an area of interest for you -- we'd love to have more voices at the table!

<p>Amber Graner’s personal open source journey started in 2009 when she started blogging about Ubuntu. Since then she’s written for Ubuntu User Magazine, co-authored The Official Ubuntu Book (6th &amp; 7th edit.) and served as a technical reviewer for Jono Bacon’s Art of Community. She was the first Community Manager for Linaro (Linux on ARM) and went on to help architect and manage the Open Compute Project (OCP) Foundation Community where she later became the Operations Director from there she went to Corelight to become the Director of Community for the Zeek Project and later was the VP of Community and Marketing at Arrikto Inc. Currently, Amber is the Open Source Evangelist and Community manager at HPE, for the Ezmeral software products. </p>
<p>Amber actively mentors new leaders in open source on how to build their community or project of interest and encourages everyone around her to participate, support, and learn about Kubeflow and Open Source software and hardware. With a smile and a sense of humor, Amber reminds people that there is a place for everyone in an open source community – regardless of technical skill level (or lack thereof). She is constantly looking for people, places, and events within open source communities that help inspire others to communicate, collaborate and contribute to those communities.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Fen Aldrich, a Developer Advocate with Equinix, talks about their open source partner program and giving back to the open source community. Fen highlights collaborative relationships they've established with key projects, serving as a testing ground and leveraging their surplus of hardware and network resources. We discussed that appreciating the human aspect of tech is crucial, as all technical systems ultimately depend on human innovation and interaction. We also nerd out a bit about the basics of networking and the technology underneath the magic we all take for granted.

With a community of over 150,000 developers each year, MLH is influencing the future of technology by helping their members gain hands-on experience with open source development. Fiona shares that while interest in open source is at an all-time high, many students face the barrier of getting started. The conversation concludes with Fiona’s advice for community leaders to show value and encourage contributions from people at any skill level. </p>

<p>Doug Boom is a Principal Engineer at Intel Ethernet.  Heading into his 29th year at Intel Ethernet, Doug has done it all when it comes to Ethernet.  Driver writer, product technical lead, architect, people and project management, he has lately been doing custom implementations with Intel Ethernet partners.  His code is in everything from soda machines, enterprise ethernet switches, lottery kiosks, ultrasound machines, cars, planes, trains and even rovers on Mars.  He has over 20 patents, and has invented technologies used in billions of dollars of solutions.  He’s had code in the Linux kernel since the old 2.4 days, but for reasons he can’t explain, his favorite distro is Ubuntu.   Doug is an Ethernet evangelist, you can see him talk about Ethernet basics at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hojUcEqUS4I'>this YouTube link</a> and history and some product stories at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU97Zsn5l1w'>this YouTube link</a>.  Doug writes fiction, makes board games and plays video games in his spare time.</p>



<p>Kevin W. Bross is an Intel Principal Engineer and modular systems architect in Intel’s Network and Edge Group (NEX).   Over the past 30+ years at Intel, he has held a variety of engineering and marketing roles at Intel, including defining bladed systems products, architecting Intel's first M2M/IoT gateway product, working on the development/trials of 64-antenna Massive MIMO cellular base stations, and architecting Intel’s first three timing-related network adapters.  Kevin is currently working on 5G infrastructure and system design for Intel reference designs and numerous customer systems.</p>

Doug Boom is a Principal Engineer at Intel Ethernet.  Heading into his 29th year at Intel Ethernet, Doug has done it all when it comes to Ethernet.  Driver writer, product technical lead, architect, people and project management, he has lately been doing custom implementations with Intel Ethernet partners.  His code is in everything from soda machines, enterprise ethernet switches, lottery kiosks, ultrasound machines, cars, planes, trains and even rovers on Mars.  He has over 20 patents, and has invented technologies used in billions of dollars of solutions.  He’s had code in the Linux kernel since the old 2.4 days, but for reasons he can’t explain, his favorite distro is Ubuntu.   Doug is an Ethernet evangelist, you can see him talk about Ethernet basics at this YouTube link and history and some product stories at this YouTube link.  Doug writes fiction, makes board games and plays video games in his spare time.



Kevin W. Bross is an Intel Principal Engineer and modular systems architect in Intel’s Network and Edge Group (NEX).   Over the past 30+ years at Intel, he has held a variety of engineering and marketing roles at Intel, including defining bladed systems products, architecting Intel's first M2M/IoT gateway product, working on the development/trials of 64-antenna Massive MIMO cellular base stations, and architecting Intel’s first three timing-related network adapters.  Kevin is currently working on 5G infrastructure and system design for Intel reference designs and numerous customer systems.

<p>Kat Cosgrove</p>
<p>In her role as a Lead Developer Advocate at Dell, Kat focuses on the growth and nurturing of open source through authentic contribution. In particular, her specialties are approachable 101-level content and deep dives on the history of technology, with a particular focus on DevOps and cloud native. She has served on the Kubernetes release team since v1.22.</p>
<p>When she’s not at a conference, she spends her time playing video games, watching horror movies, or reading science fiction, but her current hyperfixation is film photography. She lives in Scotland with her cat, Espresso, who is the real brains behind the operation and actually ghostwriting all of her tweets.</p>
