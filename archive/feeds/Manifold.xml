        <![CDATA[<p>Steve and Corey talk to Warren Hatch, President and CEO of Good Judgment Inc. Warren explains what makes someone a good forecaster and how the ability to integrate and assess information allows cognitively diverse teams to outperform prediction markets.

        <![CDATA[<p>Corey and Steve interview Leif Wenar, Professor of Philosophy at Stanford University and author of Blood Oil. They begin with memories of Leif and Corey’s mutual friend David Foster Wallace and end with a discussion of John Rawls and Robert Nozick (Wenar’s thesis advisor at Harvard, and a friend of Steve’s). Corey asks whether Leif shares his view that analytic philosophy had become too divorced from wider intellectual life. Leif explains his effort to re-engage philosophy in the big issues of our day as Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Mill and Marx were in theirs. He details how a trip to Nigeria gave him insight into the real problems facing real people in oil-rich countries. Leif explains how the legal concept of “efficiency” led to the resource curse and argues that we should refuse to buy oil from countries that are not minimally accountable to their people. Steve notes that some may find this approach too idealistic and not in the US interest. Leif suggests that what philosophers can contribute is the ability to see the big synthetic picture in a complex world.</p><p><strong><br>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/episode-049#transcript">Transcript</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wenar.info/about">Leif Wenar</a> (Bio)</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25735903-blood-oil">Blood Oil: Tyrants, Violence, and the Rules That Run the World</a></li><li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/">John Rawls </a>– Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</li><li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nozick-political/">Peter Nozick</a> – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</li></ul>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Steve and Corey talk to Adam Dynes of Brigham Young University about whether voting has an effect on policy outcomes. Adam’s work finds that control of state legislatures or governorships does not have an observable effect on macroscopic variables such as crime rates, the economy, etc. Possible explanations: parties push essentially the same policies, politicians don’t keep promises, monied interest control everything. Are voting decisions just noisy mood affiliation?

        <![CDATA[<p>Steve and Corey talk to Adam Dynes of Brigham Young University about whether voting has an effect on policy outcomes. Adam’s work finds that control of state legislatures or governorships does not have an observable effect on macroscopic variables such as crime rates, the economy, etc. Possible explanations: parties push essentially the same policies, politicians don’t keep promises, monied interest control everything. Are voting decisions just noisy mood affiliation? Perhaps time is better spent obsessing about sports teams, which at least generates pleasure.</p><p><strong><br>Topics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>1:22 </strong>– What is retrospective voting?</li><li><strong>5:43</strong> – Research findings on retrospective voting</li><li><strong>14:02</strong> – Uniparty/Monied interests?</li><li><strong>17:23</strong> – Martin Gilens’ research</li><li><strong>23:10 </strong>– Are people just voting based on noise or mood affiliation?</li><li><strong>27:13</strong> – Bryan Caplan – Myth of the Rational Voter</li><li><strong>34:35</strong> – Is time better spent obsessing about sports teams, which at least generates pleasure?</li><li><strong>39:42</strong> – After the fall of Athens, was democracy commonly referred to as irrational mob rule?</li><li><strong>48:22</strong> – Does this research translate to the national level?</li><li><strong>52:19</strong> – Super Nerdy Stuff: Statistical Analysis, Reproducibility &amp; Null Results</li><li><strong>56:40</strong> – Reactions to the results</li></ul><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/episode-035/#transcript">Transcript</a></li><li><a href="http://adamdynes.com/">Adam Dynes (Personal Website)</a></li><li><a href="https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage/amd44">Adam Dynes (Faculty Profile)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/noisy-retrospection-the-effect-of-party-control-on-policy-outcomes/A87D42DD1778755E71DC65B1825B64D5">Noisy Retrospection: The Effect of Party Control on Policy Outcomes</a></li></ul>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Our guest, Barbara O’Brien, explains why we don’t know much about conviction error outside of murder cases, making error rates for the vast majority of crimes: misdemeanors, sexual assaults, armed robbery, etc. a “dark ocean”. She explains factors that contribute to wrongful convictions including mistaken cross-racial identification in sexual assault cases. Barbara also talks about the surprising frequency of “rain damage” to evidence rooms and why Texas leads the way in both executions and criminal justice reform. The two consider why having your death sentence commuted to life in prison means you are actually less likely to ever to be released.</p><p><strong><br>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/episode-030#transcript">Transcript</a></li><li><a href="https://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=492">Barbara O’Brien (Faculty Profile)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx">The National Registry Of Exonerations</a></li></ul>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Steve and Corey talk to Ted about his article for the August issue of Harper’s Magazine, “The Last Frontier”.

The dogma that humans do not, gave way to the dogma that they do, which is now being questioned. Adult neurogenesis has been associated with learning, better cognitive function and resistance to depression.

        <![CDATA[<p>Steve and Corey talk to Betsy McKay, senior writer on U.S. and global public health at The Wall Street Journal, about her recent articles on heart disease. Betsy describes how background reporting led to her article linking the recent drop in life expectancy in the United States, often attributed to the opioid crisis or increases in middle age suicides due to economic despair, to the increasing prevalence of heart disease, driven by the rise in obesity. The three also discuss current public health recommendations on how to reduce heart disease risk and on the use of calcium scans to assess arterial plaque buildup. Steve describes boutique medical programs available to the super-rich that include full body scans to search for early signs of disease. Betsy elaborates on how she approached reporting on a new study linking egg consumption to higher cholesterol and increased risk of death, a result at odds with other recent findings and national recommendations that two eggs a day eggs is safe and healthy.

Finally, they consider whether people are wasting money on buying fish oil supplements.</p><p><strong><br>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/2019/10/03/episode-020-transcript/">Transcript</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/death-rates-rising-for-young-middle-aged-u-s-adults-11563854580">Death Rates Rising for Young, Middle-Aged U.S. Adults</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-fight-heart-disease-11561129177">How to Reduce Your Risk of Heart Disease</a></li><li><a href="https://www.heart.org/-/media/data-import/downloadables/hypertension-guideline-highlights-flyer-ucm_497841.pdf">New BP guidelines that set elevated BP as above 120mmHG/80 and Stage 1 hypertension is 120-130/80-90, Stage 2 140/90 or above.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2017/11/08/11/47/mon-5pm-bp-guideline-aha-2017">New ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guidelines Lower Definition of Hypertension</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-decades-of-progress-america-backslides-on-heart-disease-11561129106">Heart Attack at 49—America’s Biggest Killer Makes a Deadly Comeback</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-links-eggs-to-higher-cholesterol-and-risk-of-heart-disease-11552662001">Study Links Eggs to Higher Cholesterol and Risk of Heart Disease</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fish-oil-hunting-for-evidence-to-tip-the-scales-11546448408">Fish Oil: Hunting for Evidence to Tip the Scales</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/health/vaping-e-cigarettes-marijuana-cdc.html">Don’t Use Bootleg or Street Vaping Products, C.D.C.

        <![CDATA[<p>Dr. Rebecca Campbell is a Professor of Psychology at Michigan State University, whose research focuses on violence against women and children with an emphasis on sexual assault. Steve and Corey discuss her recent National Institute of Justice-funded project to study Detroit’s untested rape kits. Dr. Campbell describes the problem of untested kits and her work with police departments around the country to reduce the backlog. She explains how the use of the national CODIS database has led to sharply higher estimates of the proportion of rapes committed by serial perpetrators and how many rapists appear to be criminal “generalists”, committing a wide range of offenses. She describes the dynamics of sexual assault investigations, the factors that lead police to put more effort into investigating certain cases over others, and how common ways of questioning women can lead them to disengage from the process.

        <![CDATA[<p>Daniel Max, staff writer at The New Yorker and author of Every Love Story is A Ghost Story, a biography of David Foster Wallace, speaks with Corey and Steve about his first book, The Family that Couldn’t Sleep. The discussion covers the emerging genre of literary non-fiction, Daniel’s process of writing The Family that Couldn’t Sleep, and how he approached and gained the trust of the family at the heart of the story. Corey probes Daniel about how he handled the complex scientific characters, Carl Gajdusek and Stanley Prusiner, who led research into prion disease for 40 years. Daniel recounts how Shirley Glasse (now Lindenbaum) discovered how prions were transmitted through ritual cannibalism in Papua New, a critical step in solving the mystery of what causes of the disease, but how credit was given to Gajdusek. The three discuss the painfully slow pace of research and the inspiring story of a young couple, Eric Minikel and Sonia Vallabh, who have changed careers to dedicate their lives to finding a cure.</p><p><strong><br>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/d-t-max">Max’s New Yorker Page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/06/magazine/3-case-study-fatal-familial-insomnia-location-venice-italy-to-sleep-no-more.html">Max’s initial 2001 article for the New York Times Magazine on the Italian Family with FFI</a></li><li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-prion-love-story">Max’s 2013 New Yorker story on Minikel and Vallabh</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32264.The_Family_That_Couldn_t_Sleep">The Family that Couldn’t Sleep</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13589124-every-love-story-is-a-ghost-story">Every Love Story is A Ghost Story</a></li><li><a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/2019/07/25/episode-015-transcript/">Transcript</a></li></ul>]]>

We discuss Stuart’s recent research showing that current models of olfactory processing are wrong, while Steve delves into the puzzling infinities in calculations that led to the development of quantum electrodynamics.

        <![CDATA[<p>Corey and Steve continue their discussion with Joe Cesario and examine methodological biases in the design and conduct of experiments in social psychology and ideological bias in the interpretation of the findings. Joe argues that experiments in his field are designed to be simple but that in making experimental set ups simple researchers remove critical factors that actually matter for a police officer to make a decision in the real world. In consequence, he argues that the results cannot be taken to show anything about actual police behavior. Joe maintains that social psychology as a whole is biased toward the left politically and that this affects how courses are taught and research conducted. Steve points out the university faculty on the whole tend to be shifted left relative to the general population. Joe, Corey, and Steve discuss the current ideological situation on campus and how it can be alienating for students from conservative backgrounds.</p><p><strong><br>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cesariolab.com/">Joseph Cesario’s Lab</a></li><li><a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-look-at-racial-disparities-in-police-use-of-deadly-force-98681">A new look at racial disparities in police use of deadly force</a></li><li><a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/2019/06/27/episode-013-transcript/">Transcript</a></li></ul>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Corey and Steve speak with Samuel Kerstein, Professor of Philosophy and expert in Medical Ethics at the University of Maryland. They discuss the ethics of genome engineering and preimplantation embryo selection, and the inequality and narrowing of human diversity that might result from widespread adoption of these technologies. Among the topics covered: Why genome engineering at this time is immoral. Should we always pick the healthiest embryo? In the future will parents have a moral obligation to engineer their children? Will there be an arms race between countries to engineer their populations? Is Star Trek’s Khan a more advanced person (Steve) or just another smart psychopath (Sam) or both?</p><p><strong><br>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/people/kerstein">Samuel J.
