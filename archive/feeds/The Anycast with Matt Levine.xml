			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine chats with Dave Hamilton, Founder of BackBeat Media. They discuss what it really takes to build a podcast—from building community and attracting sponsors to maintaining top-tier audio quality and treating your show like a business. Dave shares hard-earned insights from nearly 20 years behind the mic, including how to get your first 25,000 listeners, why most podcasters quit too early, and what separates the pros from the rest. Learn how to grow your audience, build a sustainable podcasting brand, and create a show listeners genuinely care about.</p> <ul> <li>Dave shares how the Mac Geek Gab podcast went from 1,000 to 25,000 listeners, three weeks after Apple added podcasts to iTunes.</li> <li>Dave highlights the two rules that became the foundation of his podcast: always release on time, and never compromise on audio quality. </li> <li>To him, consistency wasn’t just about discipline, it was a promise to the listener that they could count on the show to show up and sound good every single time.</li> <li>Dave believes poor audio wears people out because bad audio makes it hard to focus, and that makes it harder for your audience to care about you.</li> <li>Dave emphasizes that building a loyal audience is less about numbers and more about ownership. When people feel like the show belongs to them and they’re part of the community, they stick around longer, engage more, and tell their friends.</li> <li>Dave explains the benefits of getting a listener to financially support your show. The moment someone gives you even a dollar, they become twice as invested in following your podcast. </li> <li>Dave questions the logic of removing ads for paying supporters. He argues that if someone values your show enough to pay for it, they’re also likely to value your sponsors, especially if those sponsors are a good fit. </li> <li>Mark and Dave explain why your audience shouldn’t feel like they’re being sold to—they should feel like they’re being shown something useful by someone they trust. That’s how sponsorship becomes service, not interruption. </li> <li>Dave insists on vetting every potential sponsor by asking: Will this resonate with my audience? Can I genuinely get behind this? </li> <li>If you can’t speak about a product with conviction, your audience will hear it, and the trust you’ve built could evaporate.</li> <li>Dave describes what it means to be a fiercely independent podcaster. </li> <li>Dave shares a powerful truth about discoverability: most podcast listeners are looking for their next favorite show. The easiest way to get in front of them is to partner with other podcasters, promote each other’s work, and give your audience new voices to trust.</li> <li>Dave reminds us that podcasting is one of the most intentional media formats in the world. </li> <li>No one stumbles into a podcast; every listener has already opted in, and that level of buy-in makes the connection between host and audience deeply valuable.</li> <li>Dave leans into the concept of 1,000 true fans. He believes that when you build an audience that shows up for you, not just your content, you’re already halfway to financial sustainability. </li> <li>Dave believes the best podcasters sit in front of the mic because they have something to say, and they say it with conviction. If others listen, great. But the drive comes from within.</li> <li>Dave shares a powerful insight: if one person reaches out, whether to thank you or argue with you, you’ve won. That kind of emotional reaction means they’re invested, and that kind of listener will come back. </li> <li>Matt and Dave break down the critical early drop-off point for podcasters. </li> <li>Most people quit before episode 10. But if you can stay consistent for six months, you massively increase your odds of long-term success.</li> <li>Dave draws a line between podcasting and music. A good podcaster, like a good musician, doesn’t just deliver sound—they create a feeling.</li> <li>Dave outlines the traits that define great podcasters: discipline, sincerity, curiosity, and a genuine desire to serve. You don’t need to be a performer—you need to be someone worth listening to.</li> <li>According to Dave, we’re still in the early innings of podcasting. Despite how crowded it feels, the majority of people still don’t listen regularly. That means the biggest opportunities haven’t even hit yet.</li> <li>Dave sees podcasting as the most effective form of modern word-of-mouth. When a trusted voice says, “go check this out,” people act on it. And that’s what makes podcast advertising, done right, so powerful.</li> <li>Dave ends with a message of hope: there are infinite corners of the market still unclaimed—and if you’re willing to show up with consistency and care, one of them can be yours.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davehamilton/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Hamilton on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>The inaugural episode of <a href= "https://www.macgeekgab.com/episode/1/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Mac Geek Gab Podcast</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theanycast.com/s2e12" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theanycast.com/s2e12</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine chats with Dave Jackson, Head of Podpage and founder of The School of Podcasting.</p> <p>Dave shares how he got started in podcasting, the lessons he’s learned across nearly two decades, and why staying true to your audience matters more than ever. They discuss the early struggles of launching a show, the right way to grow without losing your voice, how AI is reshaping content creation, and the real keys to standing out in a crowded podcasting world.</p> <ul> <li>Dave shares how he got into podcasting back in 2006, launched The School of Podcasting, worked for Libsyn for eight years, and got inducted into the Podcast Hall of Fame.</li> <li>Dave gets honest about the painful early days of launching a podcast in 2006 — when the tech was clunky, the process was ugly, and few people knew what a podcast was.</li> <li>Dave explains why the first few minutes of a podcast should set the tone and direction for the entire episode.</li> <li>Dave shares the easiest way to get more clicks on your podcast: write amazing titles and then make sure you deliver on the promise that’s on your titles.</li> <li>Dave explains his view on AI in podcasting: he’s not anti-AI, but warns that podcasters can’t afford to get lazy. Personality matters, and if you strip that out, you risk losing what makes your show special.</li> <li>How podcasting is different from radio and why podcasters should resist cramming shows with ads the way radio did.</li> <li>Dave and Matt share their thoughts on what really defines a podcast. For them, if it’s wrapped in an RSS feed, it counts — which makes them a little skeptical about stats that claim YouTube is now the top way to find podcasts.</li> <li>Matt brings up a powerful point: whenever you put an algorithm between you and your audience, you risk shifting your focus from serving your people to pleasing the algorithm.</li> <li>According to Dave, YouTube monetization can quietly pulls creators away from focusing on their listeners. The more you chase impressions and ad dollars, the easier it is to forget about the people you're actually creating for.</li> <li>Matt and Dave discuss how podcasters can balance creating for their audience while still navigating the algorithm. </li> <li>Dave uses a "three-legged stool" analogy to explain sustainable podcasting: you need your health, your attitude, and strong support around you. Lose one, and the whole thing can fall apart.</li> <li>Matt and Dave break down two of the biggest challenges in podcasting today: discovery and audience building.</li> <li>Dave’s advice for new podcasters: get feedback early. Make your first episode as good as possible, share it with people and ask them what they think.</li> <li>Dave points out the mistake most new podcasters make: they obsess over tech, microphones, and platforms, when in reality, listeners only care about good content.</li> <li>Dave talks about self-promotion and why it shouldn’t feel salesy if you genuinely believe in your product and your mission to help people. </li> <li>The two must-haves for podcasting success:you need to know exactly who your audience is, and your 'why.' </li> <li>Matt and Dave explore the fine line between AI and podcasting.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine chats with Dave Jackson, Head of Podpage and founder of The School of Podcasting.</p> <p>Dave shares how he got started in podcasting, the lessons he’s learned across nearly two decades, and why staying true to your audience matters more than ever. They discuss the early struggles of launching a show, the right way to grow without losing your voice, how AI is reshaping content creation, and the real keys to standing out in a crowded podcasting world.</p> <ul> <li>Dave shares how he got into podcasting back in 2006, launched The School of Podcasting, worked for Libsyn for eight years, and got inducted into the Podcast Hall of Fame.</li> <li>Dave gets honest about the painful early days of launching a podcast in 2006 — when the tech was clunky, the process was ugly, and few people knew what a podcast was.</li> <li>Dave explains why the first few minutes of a podcast should set the tone and direction for the entire episode.</li> <li>Dave shares the easiest way to get more clicks on your podcast: write amazing titles and then make sure you deliver on the promise that’s on your titles.</li> <li>Dave explains his view on AI in podcasting: he’s not anti-AI, but warns that podcasters can’t afford to get lazy. Personality matters, and if you strip that out, you risk losing what makes your show special.</li> <li>How podcasting is different from radio and why podcasters should resist cramming shows with ads the way radio did.</li> <li>Dave and Matt share their thoughts on what really defines a podcast. For them, if it’s wrapped in an RSS feed, it counts — which makes them a little skeptical about stats that claim YouTube is now the top way to find podcasts.</li> <li>Matt brings up a powerful point: whenever you put an algorithm between you and your audience, you risk shifting your focus from serving your people to pleasing the algorithm.</li> <li>According to Dave, YouTube monetization can quietly pulls creators away from focusing on their listeners. The more you chase impressions and ad dollars, the easier it is to forget about the people you're actually creating for.</li> <li>Matt and Dave discuss how podcasters can balance creating for their audience while still navigating the algorithm. </li> <li>Dave uses a "three-legged stool" analogy to explain sustainable podcasting: you need your health, your attitude, and strong support around you. Lose one, and the whole thing can fall apart.</li> <li>Matt and Dave break down two of the biggest challenges in podcasting today: discovery and audience building.</li> <li>Dave’s advice for new podcasters: get feedback early. Make your first episode as good as possible, share it with people and ask them what they think.</li> <li>Dave points out the mistake most new podcasters make: they obsess over tech, microphones, and platforms, when in reality, listeners only care about good content.</li> <li>Dave talks about self-promotion and why it shouldn’t feel salesy if you genuinely believe in your product and your mission to help people. </li> <li>The two must-haves for podcasting success:you need to know exactly who your audience is, and your 'why.' </li> <li>Matt and Dave explore the fine line between AI and podcasting. For Matt, technology will always keep moving forward. Rather than resist it, creators need to accept, adjust, and evolve with it.</li> <li>Matt makes a sharp distinction: AI and language models are good at facts but they can't capture meaning. Turning facts into something truly meaningful still takes a human touch.</li> <li>Matt and Dave agree that what separates a good show from a bad show is not tech tricks or having celebrities as guests, it’s whether your content genuinely gives people what they came for.</li> <li>Dave shares his definition of a great podcast: it needs to make you laugh, cry, think, groan, educate, or entertain.</li> <li>Dave explains why great podcasts aren’t just about great content, they’re about how that content is delivered.

With over 1,930 podcast episodes and newsletters, James shares his insights on why audio is still king, even as podcasts with video gain traction.</p> <p>They discuss the real advantage of audio, how podcasting thrives as the ultimate multitasking medium, and why time spent listening matters more than audience size.</p> <ul> <li>James starts by explaining how radio and podcasting are fundamentally different. </li> <li>James shares how he managed to sustain a daily podcast and newsletter for over 1930 episodes. He reveals the systems and tricks he’s developed to automate the boring stuff so he can focus on what truly matters.</li> <li>The one thing that will make podcasting sustainable for you. It’s not about working harder—it’s about removing friction and maximizing creative energy.</li> <li>James on the shortcuts that make podcasting easier over time.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine sits down with Christoph Grasser, an audio engineer, musician, producer, and the head of strategy for Auphonic, an all-in-one audio post-production web tool.</p> <p>They discuss why finding a loyal niche audience is more valuable than chasing viral success, how to not let technical barriers kill your ideas, why most people still prefer audio podcasts, and how AI will make content creation more accessible.</p> <ul> <li>Chris starts by sharing his journey from supporting artists behind the scenes to becoming the head of strategy at Auphonic.</li> <li>Matt and Chris discuss why cleaning up audio is so satisfying. There’s a deep sense of fulfillment in taking raw, imperfect recordings and transforming them into something clear and professional.</li> <li>Chris’s #1 pet peeve in podcasting: poorly produced audio due to lack of effort.

It’s not content quality, it’s marketing.</li> <li>Many of the biggest podcasts don’t have the best production or most insightful discussions.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine talks with Erica Mandy, Founder and Host of The NewsWorthy, an award-winning daily news podcast.</p> <p>They discuss Erica’s bold leap from TV news reporting to podcasting and why she felt compelled to create a more accessible, less anxiety-inducing way for people to stay informed. She shares the challenges of starting and growing a news podcast, how she curates engaging yet unbiased content, and the lessons she’s learned from releasing over 1,000 episodes.</p> <ul> <li>Erica starts by explaining why she left TV news for podcasting. She wanted to create a better way for people to stay informed—one that didn’t rely on anxiety-inducing breaking news alerts or require hours of daily commitment.</li> <li>Why was podcasting the perfect fit? Unlike TV or print, podcasts let people listen on their own time—during a commute, while cooking, or even at the gym—making news more accessible.</li> <li>Erica shares how she overcame the fear of competition. She acknowledges that new podcasters often worry about competition, but she believes multiple voices can coexist, each bringing something unique to the table.</li> <li>Matt breaks down the biggest myth in entrepreneurship.</li> <li>People think an idea is the most valuable asset in a business, but in reality, execution determines success. Even a world-changing idea is worthless without action.</li> <li>Erica and Matt discuss what it’s like to be underestimated. She opens up about being doubted throughout the first months of launching a podcast and how she turned skepticism into motivation to succeed.</li> <li>Matt and Erica discuss the role of AI in podcasting. AI can streamline parts of the podcasting process, but it’s still just a tool, not a replacement for human creativity.</li> <li>Why AI isn’t ready to replace human storytelling. Erica believes AI can assist with production, but it lacks the depth, nuance, and emotional intelligence needed to create engaging content from scratch.</li> <li>The secret to making a podcast feel personal – listeners connect with hosts who feel and sound real.</li> <li>For Erica, a successful show isn’t just about downloads. It’s about engagement. Erica prioritizes interacting with listeners, gathering feedback, and making them feel heard.</li> <li>Erica breaks down the news curation process—how she picks what to cover – With so much happening daily, her key filter is: Does this story impact my listener? If it doesn’t, it’s not worth including.</li> <li>Erica’s goal isn’t just to update people—it’s to offer multiple perspectives, avoid bias, and ensure the news feels trustworthy.</li> <li>Erica and Matt discuss the challenge of capturing attention without clickbait. While sensationalism dominates the media, Erica believes you can be engaging without sacrificing integrity.</li> <li>Matt and Erica agree that extreme voices dominate social media. Algorithms reward outrage. Controversy keeps people engaged—even if they disagree—so the loudest, most divisive figures often rise to the top.</li> <li>Matt argues that media companies rely on polarizing pundits because conflict drives engagement, making society more divided than ever.</li> <li>News fatigue is real—two-thirds of Americans are burned out by news. Constant negativity has made many people disengage from current events.</li> <li>Looking back on 1,000+ episodes, Erica reflects on how her show has changed over time and what she’s learned since episode one.</li> <li>Why practicing in private matters – Before launching publicly, Erica sought feedback from close friends and family. Testing and refining early on gave her the confidence to succeed.</li> <li>Erica shares the reality of running a podcast as a business.</li> <li>The theory of starting a show is exciting, but actually growing and sustaining a podcast brand is a different challenge altogether.</li> <li>Why a little naivety can be helpful in business. If you knew everything before starting, you might be too afraid to take the leap. Erica believes that sometimes, blind optimism can be a good thing.</li> <li>The U.S. leads in entrepreneurship—until age 31, when rates drop sharply. According to Matt, a key reason could be that that’s when most people have kids, making risk-taking harder.</li> <li>The power of delegation—learning to let go. Every hire takes over a job you once did. Letting go of control can be tough, but it’s crucial for growth.</li> <li>Understand that hiring is not a cost—it’s an investment.</li> <li>Erica’s parenting advice—research, but trust your gut: No amount of reading can fully prepare you. Whether it’s raising a child or running a business, sometimes you just have to trust yourself.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="http://thenewsworthy.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">TheNewsWorthy.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/newsworthypod" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">The NewsWorthy on Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="http://ericamandy.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">EricaMandy.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theanycast.com/s2e8" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theanycast.com/s2e8</a></p>]]></description>

It’s about engagement. Erica prioritizes interacting with listeners, gathering feedback, and making them feel heard.</li> <li>Erica breaks down the news curation process—how she picks what to cover – With so much happening daily, her key filter is: Does this story impact my listener? If it doesn’t, it’s not worth including.</li> <li>Erica’s goal isn’t just to update people—it’s to offer multiple perspectives, avoid bias, and ensure the news feels trustworthy.</li> <li>Erica and Matt discuss the challenge of capturing attention without clickbait. While sensationalism dominates the media, Erica believes you can be engaging without sacrificing integrity.</li> <li>Matt and Erica agree that extreme voices dominate social media. Algorithms reward outrage. Controversy keeps people engaged—even if they disagree—so the loudest, most divisive figures often rise to the top.</li> <li>Matt argues that media companies rely on polarizing pundits because conflict drives engagement, making society more divided than ever.</li> <li>News fatigue is real—two-thirds of Americans are burned out by news. Constant negativity has made many people disengage from current events.</li> <li>Looking back on 1,000+ episodes, Erica reflects on how her show has changed over time and what she’s learned since episode one.</li> <li>Why practicing in private matters – Before launching publicly, Erica sought feedback from close friends and family. Testing and refining early on gave her the confidence to succeed.</li> <li>Erica shares the reality of running a podcast as a business.</li> <li>The theory of starting a show is exciting, but actually growing and sustaining a podcast brand is a different challenge altogether.</li> <li>Why a little naivety can be helpful in business. If you knew everything before starting, you might be too afraid to take the leap. Erica believes that sometimes, blind optimism can be a good thing.</li> <li>The U.S. leads in entrepreneurship—until age 31, when rates drop sharply. According to Matt, a key reason could be that that’s when most people have kids, making risk-taking harder.</li> <li>The power of delegation—learning to let go. Every hire takes over a job you once did. Letting go of control can be tough, but it’s crucial for growth.</li> <li>Understand that hiring is not a cost—it’s an investment.</li> <li>Erica’s parenting advice—research, but trust your gut: No amount of reading can fully prepare you. Whether it’s raising a child or running a business, sometimes you just have to trust yourself.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="http://thenewsworthy.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">TheNewsWorthy.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/newsworthypod" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">The NewsWorthy on Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="http://ericamandy.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">EricaMandy.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theanycast.com/s2e8" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theanycast.com/s2e8</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Case You Missed It...</p> <p>Former morning radio producer and host Gord Vickman joins us for a captivating journey through the shifting sands of the media landscape.

This caused radio revenue to plummet and with that, the ability for radio stations to hire competent talent.</li> <li>What happened to the radio audience? For Gord, many people still listen to the radio. But people are no longer purchasing products from radio ads.</li> <li>The reason radio ads no longer work is that they’ve always been spray and pray. Just push out ads and pray that one person who’s in the market for your product hears your ad and proceeds to buy using your coupon code.</li> <li>Matt and Gord agree that marketers today lack patience.

You can’t put out an ad and expect people to sign up immediately; sometimes it can take years before you get a return.</li> <li>The key lies in stacking as much value as you can upfront. Value builds trust, creates loyalty, and positions you as someone worth paying attention to.</li> <li>Matt compares podcast advertising today versus podcast advertising in 2006.</li> <li>The best compliment to a service is your people never complain.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine talks to Lou Mongello, a former attorney who left the practice of law to follow his passion for Disney.</p> <p>They discuss the business side of running a podcast, ways to consistently create unique experiences for your audience, and lessons from Disney World that you can apply to your business immediately.</p> <ul> <li>Lou is a passionate keynote speaker, mentor, and host of WDW Radio, a podcast, live video, site, events, books, and tours dedicated to celebrating the magic of Walt Disney World, the Disney Parks, Disney Cruise Line, Marvel, and Star Wars.</li> <li>Lou starts the conversation by sharing why he switched from practicing law to building a Disney-inspired business.</li> <li>Lou talks about writing and publishing a book today versus twenty years ago.</li> <li>The best part about writing a book today is that there are no more gatekeepers. There are many platforms that will help you get the idea from your mind and onto paper.</li> <li>Lou shares what it was like getting 47 rejections from book publishers and what he did to persevere.</li> <li>According to Lou, the key to overcoming rejection is to never take rejection personally and never question the validity of your concept.</li> <li>Matt and Lou talk about the dos and don'ts of starting a business and whether it’s advisable to go all in or have a safety net for when things don’t go as planned.</li> <li>For Matt, it makes sense to always have a safety net when starting a new business, especially if you have a family to provide for. But once you decide to do something, give it 100%.</li> <li>Matt explains why Being different is better than being better. You should never convince somebody that you're better than your competition. You’re better off explaining why you're different.</li> <li>Lou shares his thoughts on niching down and why even in your own niche, you can’t expect to resonate with everyone.</li> <li>Love and enjoy what you do every day. The day it stops being fun is the day you stop doing it.</li> <li>Lou covers the benefits of doing a live podcast recording versus uploading an edited podcast.</li> <li>For Lou, the most rewarding part of running a coaching business is seeing people learn, do the work, and come out different on the other side.</li> <li>Matt explains why he believes ideas today are worthless--especially if you don’t execute them.</li> <li>Having a plan and talking about what you will do is all great. But nothing beats going out and doing the work. For Matt, inspiration is for amateurs, professionals show up and do the work.</li> <li>Lou is a big fan of creating your best content because you never know who's listening and you never know the type of impact you’ll make in the world.</li> <li>Lou talks about The Dream Team Project--an initiative dedicated to bringing joy to seriously ill children and their families by making their dream of visiting Walt Disney World come true.</li> <li>Lou covers the theme of everything he does--it's not about doing things at scale. It's about connecting with one person and having a positive impact on their lives.</li> <li>Most creators are obsessed with vanity metrics and growing the size of their audience.</li> <li>According to Lou, instead of focusing on getting as many followers as possible, creators should focus on the people who are already part of the community. Take care of them and not only will they be loyal to you, they will also become your most vocal evangelists.</li> <li>Matt and Lou break down the evolution of podcasting--where we are right now, what the future holds, and whether it makes sense to start a podcast today.</li> <li>AI will not put podcasters out of business, but it's going to put podcasters who don't use AI out of business.</li> <li>For Lou, AI is a tool, it's not a replacement. Let it make you more efficient, let it make you more effective, but what you create still has to be authentically you.</li> <li>Matt and Lou close the discussion by talking about all the hot, new attractions in Disneyland and what it takes to create an immersive experience for both kids and adults. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.loumongello.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">LouMongello.com</a></p> <p><a href="http://wdwradio.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">WDWradio.com</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991498801/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=loumongello-20&linkId=0d193fe8a32dd363f309e87ef440e29f&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">102 Ways to Save Money For and At Walt Disney World</a> by Lou Mongello</p> <p><a href="https://www.theanycast.com/s2e3" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theanycast.com/s2e3</a></p>]]></description>

Let it make you more efficient, let it make you more effective, but what you create still has to be authentically you.</li> <li>Matt and Lou close the discussion by talking about all the hot, new attractions in Disneyland and what it takes to create an immersive experience for both kids and adults. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.loumongello.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">LouMongello.com</a></p> <p><a href="http://wdwradio.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">WDWradio.com</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991498801/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=loumongello-20&linkId=0d193fe8a32dd363f309e87ef440e29f&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">102 Ways to Save Money For and At Walt Disney World</a> by Lou Mongello</p> <p><a href="https://www.theanycast.com/s2e3" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theanycast.com/s2e3</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Levine talks to Elsie Escobar, an 18-year-plus podcasting veteran, mentor, strategist, and inductee to the Academy of Podcasters Hall of Fame.</p> <p>They discuss the history of podcasting, what you must do to thrive in the new age of podcasting, and how to stand out in a world where thousands of creators are doing the exact same thing you’re doing.</p> <ul> <li>Elsie starts the conversation by describing what a podcasting advocate is and how podcasting has evolved from 2006 to now.</li> <li>She shares what a podcast is not and why there is still a lot of confusion around podcasting.</li> <li>Matt and Elsie discuss how podcasting started, the evolution of the space, and where the industry will be in the next five years.</li> <li>According to Elsie, the competition for podcasting is not radio or other podcasts; it’s anything people can do instead of listening to a podcast--this includes YouTube, movies, video games, etc.</li> <li>Elsie shares how she started her very first podcast, what it was like hosting an audio-only podcast, and the type of people who consumed her content.</li> <li>How podcasting went from being odd and weird to becoming cool and hype.</li> <li>Elsie and Matt agree that the constant demand to be visible, to be creating content, and to be pushing things out is what makes creators miserable.</li> <li>How to stand out in a world where thousands of creators are doing the exact same thing you’re doing.</li> <li>Elsie breaks down ways podcasters can be successful in today’s ultra-competitive market and the difference between building an audience today and building an audience in 2005.</li> <li>Podcasting is super competitive. Elsie’s advice for new podcasters is to focus on serving a small but engaged audience instead of trying to be the next big thing.</li> <li>When we create content online, everybody’s dream scenario is to go viral.</li> <li>According to Elsie, virality is not real because it’s almost impossible to replicate the virality that people crave.</li> <li>Elsie talks about the complexity of managing extremely large audiences.</li> <li>Once you start reaching millions of people, the freedom of saying and doing whatever you want goes away.</li> <li>Matt and Elsie talk about the identity challenge--and why most podcasters cannot separate their creative side from their personal life.</li> <li>Elsie describes what it’s like to be a woman in podcasting and why we need more diversity in podcasting--diversity of thought, language, and voice.</li> <li>Elsie explains what makes a podcast popular and whether there is a formula for becoming famous online.</li> <li>Why podcast metrics are not too different to those of broadcast television.</li> <li>What will podcasting look like 10 years from now?</li> <li>Elsie talks about the future of podcasting and why podcasts need to evolve to meet the expectations of the newer, younger generation.</li> <li>Matt describes how the model for publishing podcasts has changed. Right now it’s less about publishing content and more about making sure people see enough ads.</li> <li>Is it possible to get rid of ads in the content we consume? Matt and Elsie agree that it’s almost impossible because we live in a world where ads pay for everything.</li> <li>Elsie goes through the pros and cons of online ads and why she doesn’t like social media algorithms.</li> <li>According to Matt, the main reason social media sites use algorithms is so that you can keep seeing the stuff that you want to see without paying.</li> <li>For Matt, people love being sold to. They just don’t like being sold stuff they don’t want.</li> <li>Elsie talks about AI, how it will change the podcasting space, ways to use AI in your content creation process, and how to stay relevant in a world full of AI-generated content. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/theelsieescobar" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Elsie Escobar on Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.marketingovercoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing Over Coffee Podcast</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Syndicating-Web-Sites-Feeds-Dummies/dp/0764588486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies</a> by Ellen Finkelstein</p> <p><a href="https://www.theanycast.com/s2e2" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theanycast.com/s2e2</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of The Anycast, Matt talks to Kristopher Beevers, the CEO of NetBox Labs, a solution that helps companies build and manage complex networks. Previously, Kris co-founded and led NS1, which was acquired by IBM in 2023.</p> <p>They discuss the remarkable rise of open-source projects, why many networking businesses are shifting towards cloud-based solutions, and the opportunities to watch out for in the networking space.</p> <ul> <li> <p>What is NetBox, and what makes it unique? It’s a tool used for network documentation and automation, serving as a source of truth for network configurations.</p> </li> <li> <p>NetBox's business model differs from other open-source ventures because they focus more on alleviating the burden of software management for network engineers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Networking is evolving at a fast pace. Kristopher shares what you can do today to keep up and take advantage of future opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>The difference between building a company from zero to one, the startup experience, and one to N. </p> </li> <li> <p>Kristopher breaks down the economics of the cloud and the type of companies that could save a lot of money by going to the cloud. </p> </li> <li> <p>How open-source companies make money and stay in business. </p> </li> <li> <p>According to Kristopher, hiring great people often comes down to impact. For example, engineers want to work on cool tech, but they also want to see that the tech they're working on has an impact on the world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kristopher shares how being a parent changed his approach to leadership. </p> </li> <li> <p>Matt and Kristopher discuss the resurgence of Nokia and how their decision to go the open-source route could restore their status as a tech and networking giant. </p> </li> <li> <p>Matt and Kristopher agree that most network services will shift towards cloud-based solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kristopher discusses the need to strike a balance between community-driven development and commercial support to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of open-source solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the sustainability of open-source projects like NetBox? </p> </li> <li> <p>Matt and Kristopher agree that such projects can be widely adopted but often rely on volunteer contributions. This poses challenges in long-term maintenance, development, and profitability. </p> </li> <li> <p>The pros and cons of building a company in public and transparently sharing the behind scenes of how you do it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Matt highlights the benefits of aligning employee development goals with the company's objectives. Companies must design roles that cater to an individual’s career paths and aspirations, while ensuring alignment between personal growth and organizational goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kristopher predicts that open-source solutions will disrupt traditional vendor ecosystems. More open-source solutions will gain traction and challenge established norms in the networking industry.</p> </li> <li> <p>For Kris, the reason AWS can give you the “cattle not pets” experience is purely scale. Even the biggest cloud providers can't deliver that experience because the scale isn't there.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/beevek/">Kristopher Beevers on LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://netboxlabs.com/">NetBoxlabs.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://ns1.com">ns1.com</a></p>]]></description>

According to Avi, networking is lots of little simple things that converge in complex ways mixed with vendor bugs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avi’s advice for people early in their tech careers: document your learning process. It will not make you look stupid, it will make you look curious.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avi shares his journey to becoming the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. </p> </li> <li> <p>How Matt and Avi approach learning and teaching - as soon as you have to teach something, it helps solidify your ideas.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avi talks about recognition and praise.
