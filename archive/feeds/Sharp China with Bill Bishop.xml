At the end: People’s Daily publishes an interview with Ren Zhengfei, Xi continues his attempts to curb excess among party members, and Victor Wembanyama visits a Shaolin Monastery. &#xA;</description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the China Development Forum, including China&#39;s messaging to foreign investors, revisiting the Mintz raids as five detained employees are finally released, no updates on a Xi-Trump meeting, and news in the EV space. From there: The US plans to revive shipbuilding capacity, the likely disruption if the US adopts the USTR recommendations to counter Chinese dominance, Michael Froman writes that China has remade the international system, and a few more thoughts on the CK Hutchison deal. At the end: Rumors swirl around He Weidong and others in the PLA, what the noise might signal, and news of a deep-sea cable cutter is accompanied by a reminder that China constructs and protects deep sea cable like no other.&#xA;</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with Trump raising tariffs on the PRC by 10%, the PRC&#39;s response, and the phone call Xi-Trump phone call that was rumored a month ago but still hasn&#39;t happened. Then: What to watch for during Two Sessions week, Xi has always supported private enterprises, a response from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on fentanyl, and why the U.S. focusing on domestic enforcement only goes far. From there: A roundup of news on chips, including an investigation in Singapore, TSMC&#39;s investment in the United States, a Wall Street Journal report on Nvidia, and questions facing the Trump team as new policy takes shape. At the end: The New York Times reports on &#34;plea leniency,&#34; FIFA won&#39;t play ball with the PRC, and a variety of Moutai thoughts as Kweichow Moutai struggles to find demand.&#xA;</itunes:summary>

From there: &#34;Reverse Nixon&#34; possibilities and structural realities that make it unlikely, document #1 and the party&#39;s priorities surrounding food security, a PRC fishing crew is detained for questioning after a Taiwan cable cutting incident, the significance of the PLA drills between Australia and New Zealand last week, and a word about lawfare and law firms.&#xA;</description>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin by talking through a first round of US tariffs on PRC goods and responses from the PRC earlier this week.

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the fate of TikTok after a wild week of updates. Topics include: A ByteDance investor who says that TikTok may continue in the U.S. without a full divestiture, lessons for Beijing and Americans from the past few weeks, and why potential TikTok buyers might be wary of any deal structure that doesn&#39;t comply with the letter of federal law. Then: Week 1 of the Trump presidency provides some breathing room to both sides of the US-China tariff negotiations, why negotiations may not yield any structural relief to the US-China trade tensions, updates on the PRC economy, and why Beijing may be wary of a currency devaluation in the face of a new round of tariffs. At the end: Two updates on Taiwan, why the Taiwanese may want to choose better intermediaries to the U.S. government, and the absence of US-China tensions in Hollywood. &#xA;</description>

Topics include: The September Politburo meeting as a sign of the government&#39;s commitment, why the capital markets may be a security priority for Xi, what might have motivated the sudden policy shift at the top, and parallels to the market responses in 2014. From there: The property sector and the multi-layered problem policymakers are attempting to solve, Blinken meets with Wang Yi in New York but still no word on a phone call between President Biden and Xi Jinping, a PRC nuclear submarine sinks, and a question about succession in the event of Xi&#39;s passing.</p>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with a programming note for the next few weeks and various questions for the next few months of the Biden Administration. Topics include: A meeting between Secretary of State of Anthony Blinken and Wang Yi, more threats of escalating sanctions if the PRC supports Russian war efforts, what Kamala Harris China policies might look like, and whether the Commerce Department will take action on connected vehicles before November. From there: Rumors of Huawei’s demise were greatly exaggerated, and why sanctions may have focused PRC energy without achieving their intended goal. At the end: Quick reactions to Tuesday’s Politburo meeting, some very cautious optimism at Second Thomas Shoal, and surveying the PRC swimming controversy that came to light in April and continues to percolate this week in Paris. </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with the Third Plenum resolution, Xi’s explainer, and its reception among the investment community and China observers.

From there: The party’s timeline for planning the plenum highlights the lack of leaks in the Xi era, and a reminder that trade tensions are unlikely to abate anytime soon. At the end: A variety of thoughts on news organizations and journalists navigating the environment in China and Hong Kong, and a few memories of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing before the Opening Ceremony in Paris this weekend.&#xA;</description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with PRC messaging at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, including the US responses to new Defense Minister Dong Jun, how neighboring countries perceive the divergence between PRC rhetoric and PRC actions, and takeaways from Operation Joint Sword-2024A. From there: Parsing Xi&#39;s January speech on &#34;New Quality Productive Forces&#34; in advance of the third plenum, overcapacity is becoming a political problem more than an economic debate, and a Financial Times story sheds light on the state of Russia-China negotiations surrounding the Siberia 2 pipeline. At the end: Bill remembers his time in China during the spring of 1989, thoughts on the structural forces that have suppressed memories of June 4 inside China, and lessons that the party has internalized in the decades that followed. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with takeaways from Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen&#39;s visit to China, including what her meetings may or may not accomplish and the likely next steps for the Biden Administration in the months to come. From there: As the US and Europe grapple with the threat of cheaper PRC goods in key industries, how might China respond to raised tariffs around the world? Will there be consequences for continued support of Russia&#39;s defense industrial base? And how realistic is the deterrence strategy articulated by Ambassador Rahm Emanuel this week? At the end: A question about Xi&#39;s vision for the PRC financial system, the deepening partnership between the US and Japan, the US and allies conduct naval exercises in the South China Sea, and a question about Tesla&#39;s 0% financing for PRC customers. &#xA;</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with a week of surprising progress for the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. With the House set to vote Wednesday, they discuss the origins of the bill and months of work behind the scenes, TikTok’s now-infamous in-app alert, and why Beijing is likely to oppose any divestment plan if the bill eventually becomes law. From there: The factions in Washington that are opposing this bill, regulatory obstacles for American Internet companies in China, alignment or lack thereof between US business interests and Beijing, and what the next few months for TikTok and Congress could signify. At the end: A report that Li Qiang won’t attend this year’s China Development Forum, Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius lobbies for lower tariffs in the EU, and a few final notes from the Two Sessions.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with last weekend’s election in Taiwan, where William Lai and the DPP retained their hold on the presidency but lost a majority in legislature. Topics include: The reactions from China and around the world, continued questions about a timeline for reunification, Hong Kong as a cautionary tale for the Taiwanese, Nauru and the United Nations, and sparring between the Foreign Ministry and the Philippines. From there: Li Qiang delivers good news to Davos, investors in China and Hong Kong remain wary, and one year after China announced to the world it was open for business, several factors have left confidence among the foreign investment community at an all-time low. At the end: The world waits for to China to take action in the Red Sea, a question about cannabis crackdowns in Hong Kong, and a documentary heralds a new crackdown on soccer corruption.&#xA;</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with thoughts on the readout from the Central Economic Work Conference, including the emphasis on &#34;progress&#34; alongside stability, high-quality development and high-level security, PRC attempts at brand management,  and where infrastructure investment might be going. From there: More water cannons, more controversy, and the same concerns as problems persist between the Chinese Coast Guard and the Philippines in the South China Sea. At the end: Frustrations with the hawk-dove spectrum, Henry Kissinger&#39;s complicated legacy, and questions about flights to China, academic engagement, and good Chinese TV dramas.</itunes:summary>

      <title>(Preview) Unanswered Qin Gang Questions; Three Wins for Xi Jinping Economic Thought; US Sources Float New Balloon Details; Huawei Intrigue Continues</title>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with this week&#39;s reporting on Foreign Minister Qin Gang. As sources in Beijing confirm allegations of an affair and a lovechild, plenty of questions remain. How could those details have gone undetected before Xi promoted Qin in January? Were Qin or his mistress compromised by a foreign government? And why is Party leadership apparently so comfortable disclosing Qin&#39;s affair to the international community? From there: The headline of the week from the UK, the tweet of the week from the US Ambassador to Japan, and more on Defense Minister Li Shangfu and the PLA rumors. Then: Two more bearish indicators for the economy, while wind turbine and EV controversies percolate in the EU and portend further complications to come. At the end: more details released on America&#39;s favorite unmanned civilian airship, Huawei chooses an interesting date for its product launch next week, export control speculation continues in DC, and Apple&#39;s new iPhone sells out in China.</description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with this week&#39;s reporting on Foreign Minister Qin Gang. As sources in Beijing confirm allegations of an affair and a lovechild, plenty of questions remain. How could those details have gone undetected before Xi promoted Qin in January? Were Qin or his mistress compromised by a foreign government? And why is Party leadership apparently so comfortable disclosing Qin&#39;s affair to the international community? From there: The headline of the week from the UK, the tweet of the week from the US Ambassador to Japan, and more on Defense Minister Li Shangfu and the PLA rumors. Then: Two more bearish indicators for the economy, while wind turbine and EV controversies percolate in the EU and portend further complications to come. At the end: more details released on America&#39;s favorite unmanned civilian airship, Huawei chooses an interesting date for its product launch next week, export control speculation continues in DC, and Apple&#39;s new iPhone sells out in China.</itunes:summary>

      <description>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power facility and the response from PRC authorities, media and consumers. With a ban of an imports of all aquatic products from Japan and additional boycotts proliferating, what measures might be next? And with the IAEA and many governments largely in agreement that Japan’s plan is safe enough, what does this conflict say about Chinese leadership? From there: Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo meets with Party leaders in Beijing, reactions to the early returns from those discussions, and the well-timed launch of a new Huawei phone as the Commerce delegation makes its way through the PRC. At the end: A victory lap for TikTok, memories of high-speed rail, and a few minutes on the most recent measures to stimulate the economy.&#xA;</description>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power facility and the response from PRC authorities, media and consumers. With a ban of an imports of all aquatic products from Japan and additional boycotts proliferating, what measures might be next? And with the IAEA and many governments largely in agreement that Japan’s plan is safe enough, what does this conflict say about Chinese leadership? From there: Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo meets with Party leaders in Beijing, reactions to the early returns from those discussions, and the well-timed launch of a new Huawei phone as the Commerce delegation makes its way through the PRC. At the end: A victory lap for TikTok, memories of high-speed rail, and a few minutes on the most recent measures to stimulate the economy.&#xA;</itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Bill and Andrew begin with an unexplained absence for Xi Jinping in Johannesburg before turning to the multi-faceted problems facing Beijing policymakers as the PRC economy continues to sputter. Topics include: Why a giant stimulus package remains unlikely, whether Xi is the right leader to manage a restructuring of the world&#39;s second-largest economy, the &#34;takeover or collapse&#34; false binary, and what to make of the disappearing youth unemployment data. From there: The Ministry of State Security proudly identifies two PRC nationals who were allegedly working with the CIA, while the Biden Administration successfully executes a Camp David summit with the South Korea and Japan. At the end: Beijing scuttles Intel&#39;s Tower Semiconductor plans, ARM has myriad risks in China, the Wall Street Journal goes deep on the Village Basketball League, and James Harden&#39;s wine helps stimulate consumer spending.</description>

From there: The Politburo&#39;s meeting on the economy, explaining the psychology of the current real estate market, and another edict that may put PRC companies in conflict with Western business practices. At the end: More details on what America&#39;s semiconductor companies are telling the White House, pronouncing the word &#34;Reuters,&#34; and Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kyle Anderson announces that he&#39;ll be playing for China in this summer&#39;s FIBA World Cup. </description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with a hastily called National People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee meeting, Wang Yi&#39;s return to his former role as Foreign Minister, and the removal of Qin Gang. Topics include: The messy procedure that led to this week&#39;s removal, possible explanations for Qin retaining his role as state councilor, and a possible timeline for an investigation and further announcements regarding Qin&#39;s future. Then: What Qin’s removal might mean within the Foreign Ministry, and the signals this situation is sending to the rest of the world. From there: The Politburo&#39;s meeting on the economy, explaining the psychology of the current real estate market, and another edict that may put PRC companies in conflict with Western business practices. At the end: More details on what America&#39;s semiconductor companies are telling the White House, pronouncing the word &#34;Reuters,&#34; and Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kyle Anderson announces that he&#39;ll be playing for China in this summer&#39;s FIBA World Cup. </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the mystery surrounding foreign minister Qin Gang, who has not been seen in public since June 25th. As the foreign ministry stays silent, what might explain his retreat from public view, and how does this situation reflect on Xi Jinping and the party? Then: Henry Kissinger makes a surprise visit to Beijing, meets first with Defense Minister Li Shangfu, while John Kerry meets with Li Qiang and Wang Yi to talk common ground on climate issues. Will either of them get an audience with Xi? From there: U.S. chip firms lobby the executive branch, Chinese hackers access the emails of Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and the optics get trickier for Biden&#39;s China policy. At the end: Weak economic data for Q2 and a window into who&#39;s actually driving the changes to China&#39;s relationships with the West.</description>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill talk through Secretary of State Anthony Blinken&#39;s trip to Beijing. First: The voices that convinced Biden to push for an improved relationship, what “back to Bali” actually entails, and reactions to the meetings between Blinken and PRC counterparts Qin Gang and Wang Yi. From there: The Biden Administration wants to close the book on the spy balloon, Xi&#39;s public comments concerning US competition vs. what the PRC likely believes internally, Xi&#39;s meeting with Blinken, and a sea of takes on seating arrangements, lotus flowers, runway red carpets, and Taiwan independence. At the end: A new report on the PLA&#39;s ambitions in Cuba, waiting for a fentanyl working group and more flights between the US and China, and two pieces of media recommended for all listeners. </description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill talk through Secretary of State Anthony Blinken&#39;s trip to Beijing. First: The voices that convinced Biden to push for an improved relationship, what “back to Bali” actually entails, and reactions to the meetings between Blinken and PRC counterparts Qin Gang and Wang Yi. From there: The Biden Administration wants to close the book on the spy balloon, Xi&#39;s public comments concerning US competition vs. what the PRC likely believes internally, Xi&#39;s meeting with Blinken, and a sea of takes on seating arrangements, lotus flowers, runway red carpets, and Taiwan independence. At the end: A new report on the PLA&#39;s ambitions in Cuba, waiting for a fentanyl working group and more flights between the US and China, and two pieces of media recommended for all listeners. </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the latest on Secretary Blinken&#39;s visit to Beijing before turning to a recap of several reports on PRC surveillance activities in Cuba and the evolving responses they&#39;ve elicited from the Biden Administration. From there: What Xi might be signaling with his calls to prepare for “extreme” circumstances and scenarios, more rumors of a stimulus package, and an uptick in administrative fines amid the local debt crisis. At the end: The US says South Korean chip firms can maintain and continue their existing chip fab operations in the PRC, a word about the Global Times, and a few thoughts on the transformation of Beijing in the last 10 years.</description>

      <description>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with the rejected pitch from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to meet with Defense Minister Li Shangfu this weekend. Topics include: The importance (and limits) of maintaining ongoing military backchannels, why the U.S. push for a meeting was more complicated in this case, and a postscript to last week&#39;s questions about America’s response to the silent treatment from PRC diplomats. Then: A report that the Chinese envoy sent to broker peace has urged EU countries to denounce America and demand a ceasefire in Ukraine, and ominous language surfaces in the readout from the National Security Commission. At the end: Elon Musk’s travels inspire a look at Tesla&#39;s activity in the PRC, the 16-year journey to a C919 passenger jet and celebrations on a Beijing runway, Microsoft&#39;s malware discovery, and a word about energy supply lines in a Taiwan conflict.  </description>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with the rejected pitch from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to meet with Defense Minister Li Shangfu this weekend. Topics include: The importance (and limits) of maintaining ongoing military backchannels, why the U.S. push for a meeting was more complicated in this case, and a postscript to last week&#39;s questions about America’s response to the silent treatment from PRC diplomats. Then: A report that the Chinese envoy sent to broker peace has urged EU countries to denounce America and demand a ceasefire in Ukraine, and ominous language surfaces in the readout from the National Security Commission. At the end: Elon Musk’s travels inspire a look at Tesla&#39;s activity in the PRC, the 16-year journey to a C919 passenger jet and celebrations on a Beijing runway, Microsoft&#39;s malware discovery, and a word about energy supply lines in a Taiwan conflict.  </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the strong messaging that emerged from the G-7 summit in Hiroshima and the foreign ministry‘s response, including thoughts on the ongoing trend toward bifurcation and the cycle of name-calling that pervades the relationship between the US and China. Then: a listener asks about the Biden administration’s China policies: What’s been good? What’s been bad? And what happened to the FBI’s report on the spy balloon? At the end: Two new stories on China’s municipal debt problems, one comedian is arrested in China while another is banned from Weibo, and ESPN’s delays the debut of a Michael Chang documentary for reasons that remain unclear. </description>

      <description>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with news of more raids on Western corporate intelligence firms, investors losing access to Wind Information Co., a reported uptick in foreigners facing exit bans, and the continuing conflict between business-friendly rhetoric and what Xi&#39;s security services are doing on the ground. Then: Capital flight to Singapore, various theories to explain the timing of Xi&#39;s call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and head-scratching jargon from the Chinese readout. At the end: The dynamics between India, Pakistan and China, the US strategy with India, and a question about decoupling yields discussion of Apple, Tesla and the burgeoning EV industry in China. </description>

      <itunes:summary>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with news of more raids on Western corporate intelligence firms, investors losing access to Wind Information Co., a reported uptick in foreigners facing exit bans, and the continuing conflict between business-friendly rhetoric and what Xi&#39;s security services are doing on the ground. Then: Capital flight to Singapore, various theories to explain the timing of Xi&#39;s call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and head-scratching jargon from the Chinese readout. At the end: The dynamics between India, Pakistan and China, the US strategy with India, and a question about decoupling yields discussion of Apple, Tesla and the burgeoning EV industry in China. </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the fallout from Ambassador Lu Shaye&#39;s remarks questioning the sovereign rights of former members of the Soviet Union. Where did that talking point come from? Will this complicate China&#39;s charm offensive in the EU? And where does Lu&#39;s mishap fit in the canon of PRC own-goals in recent history? From there: The arrest of journalist Dong Yuyu, various concerns surrounding the broadened language in the updated counterespionage rules expected to be passed by the Standing Committee this week, and Bill provides context on the rural banking crisis in Henan province. At the end: Janet Yellen&#39;s speech as a microcosm of muddled China messaging from the Biden administration, and a listener asks for more information on the Taiwan status quo.</description>

For the second half of the show: Real-time reactions to Thursday’s TikTok hearing in Congress, including the testimony from CEO Shou Zi Chew, the lobbying efforts that bore little fruit this week, and framing today’s TikTok reality with memories of the public apology from ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming in 2018.

At the end: Updates on Bao Fan, the crackdown on corruption in the financial sector, PRC currency ambitions, the shift to conducting life via mobile apps, and a word about gray hair. </description>

They discuss the implications of such assistance, questions about the underlying intelligence, the EU&#39;s stance, and the various considerations that make this possibility so concerning for the rest of the world. At the end: The mystery surrounding Bao Fan over the past week, the departure of Ray Dalio, uncertainty clouding the future of US-China travel, and a bit of good news from comedy clubs in New York City. </description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with reaction to the meeting between Wang Yi and Anthony Blinken in Munich last weekend, including competing readouts that signal continued tension between the U.S. and China, other statements weekend that underscore Chinese frustrations, and what to look for from both sides in the months to come. Then: Joe Biden is in Kyiv, Wang Yi is in Moscow, and Secretary of State Blinken is warning the rest of the world that China is considering providing lethal assistance to the Russians. They discuss the implications of such assistance, questions about the underlying intelligence, the EU&#39;s stance, and the various considerations that make this possibility so concerning for the rest of the world. At the end: The mystery surrounding Bao Fan over the past week, the departure of Ray Dalio, uncertainty clouding the future of US-China travel, and a bit of good news from comedy clubs in New York City. </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Bill and Andrew begin with the continuing reactions to the balloon controversy, including rumors of a Blinken-Wang Yi meeting in Munich, last weekend’s new foreign object sightings, China’s story of a flying object outside Qingdao, and reports that U.S. officials believe that the initial balloon did, in fact, fly off course. Then: Surveying the anti-American propaganda circulating among state media this week, the CPC’s new favorite journalist, and the efficacy of China&#39;s propaganda efforts worldwide. From there: A word about history books, the present-day plight of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and a listener asks for a roadmap of what a (highly unlikely) regime change might look like if Xi or the CPC are ever to be unseated. At the end: What does a chatbot look like in the PRC of the future, and what kind of impact has ChatGPT had in China for the past few months? </description>

      <description>On today’s show Andrew and Bill begin with a few reactions to Joe Biden’s comments about China in Tuesday’s State of the Union address. From there: several days of outsized reaction around Washington, mounting calls for even stronger American responses to China’s ambitions, and stress-testing the theory that last week’s balloon mess was initiated by rogue PLA agents hoping to sabotage diplomatic talks. At the end: A question about Xi’s conflicting priorities, a close reading of Xi’s comments on &#34;Chinese-style modernization,&#34; travel policies for PRC nationals, a simpler explanation for the state visit to Russia, and another note on extraterrestrial exploration.</description>

      <title>Expectations for Blinken in Beijing; A U.S. General Predicts War by 2025; Xi to Moscow?; The Decline in Chinese Language Study</title>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with a variety of thoughts in advance of next week&#39;s visit to Beijing from Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. Topics include: Why cooperation has proven difficult for both sides, hopes that the U.S. can avoid a repeat of Yang Jiechi in Anchorage, an editorial in the People&#39;s Daily, and extended thoughts on domestic political concerns underlying the intractable Taiwan dispute. From there: Reactions to a memo from U.S. General Mike Minihan instructing members of the Air Force to prepare for armed conflict with China, while the Russian Foreign Ministry announces that Xi Jinping will be visiting Moscow (and the Chinese demur when asked for confirmation). At the end: No updates on foreign Visa holders, a question about the dwindling numbers of Westerners studying Chinese, a clarification regarding Hua Chunying, and a call to listeners for UFO assistance. </description>

Topics include: Why cooperation has proven difficult for both sides, hopes that the U.S. can avoid a repeat of Yang Jiechi in Anchorage, an editorial in the People&#39;s Daily, and extended thoughts on domestic political concerns underlying the intractable Taiwan dispute. From there: Reactions to a memo from U.S. General Mike Minihan instructing members of the Air Force to prepare for armed conflict with China, while the Russian Foreign Ministry announces that Xi Jinping will be visiting Moscow (and the Chinese demur when asked for confirmation). At the end: No updates on foreign Visa holders, a question about the dwindling numbers of Westerners studying Chinese, a clarification regarding Hua Chunying, and a call to listeners for UFO assistance. </itunes:summary>

      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with thoughts on the change in tone from government officials addressing private business, changes it might signify in the short term, and concerns it may not assuage in the long term. From there: the news of a deepened strategic alliance between the US and Japan, why Beijing is outraged, and best case and worst case scenarios when evaluating the implications for a conflict in Taiwan. At the end: China’s population declines for the first time in six decades, the Shanxi party apparatus appoints party chiefs to 25 private companies, the FBI investigates undeclared police stations in the U.S., and Marvel movies return to Chinese theaters—but not during the Lunar New Year. </description>

      <title>The First Month of Reopening; Xi&amp;#39;s Credibility; Qin Gang and US-China Relations; TikTok Forfeits the Benefit of the Doubt</title>
      <link>https://sharpchina.fm/member/article/the-first-month-of-reopening-xis-credibility-qin-gang-and-us-china-relations-tik-tok-forfeits-the-benefit-of-the-doubt</link>
      <description>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill reunite after the holiday break and begin with the continued reopening process around China. Topics include: the tragedy of the past several weeks, calls for more transparency from the CCP, dubious testing requirements for Chinese travelers, the government reportedly pressing pause on some of its chip investments, and why it may take a few months before reopening yields any meaningful shift in economic data. Then: Xi&#39;s New Year&#39;s address and reactions to a spate of articles related to his standing in China. At the end: Formula 1 may be returning to China, Qin Gang goes from the Washington Wizards to the Central Committee, and TikTok&#39;s future is murkier than ever after some news that was not-quite-buried before the Christmas holiday.</description>

      <itunes:summary>On today&#39;s show Andrew and Bill reunite after the holiday break and begin with the continued reopening process around China. Topics include: the tragedy of the past several weeks, calls for more transparency from the CCP, dubious testing requirements for Chinese travelers, the government reportedly pressing pause on some of its chip investments, and why it may take a few months before reopening yields any meaningful shift in economic data. Then: Xi&#39;s New Year&#39;s address and reactions to a spate of articles related to his standing in China. At the end: Formula 1 may be returning to China, Qin Gang goes from the Washington Wizards to the Central Committee, and TikTok&#39;s future is murkier than ever after some news that was not-quite-buried before the Christmas holiday.</itunes:summary>

      <title>A Head-Spinning Reopening, Questions for Musk, The Latest on the Chip Ban, New Realities for Chinese Big Tech</title>
      <link>https://sharpchina.fm/member/article/a-head-spinning-reopening-questions-for-musk-the-latest-on-the-chip-ban-new-realities-for-chinese-big-tech</link>
      <description>On this week&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the landscape in China one week after the widespread elimination of covid restrictions. Topics include: Early reports from Beijing and other major cities, best and worst case scenarios for case numbers, what Westerners can and can’t know, and how this process (and the protests) might change perceptions of the CCP inside and outside of China. From there: &#34;The Twitter Files&#34; don&#39;t say anything about China, so Bill highlights a number of different areas and incidents he&#39;d like to learn more about during Twitter&#39;s celebration of truth and transparency. At the end: The Chinese look to the WTO for chip ban relief, a murky outlook for firms like Alibaba and leaders like Jack Ma, and a question about comedy clubs in Beijing. </description>

      <description>On this week&#39;s show Andrew and Bill begin with the passing of Jiang Zemin and an overview of the abrupt shift in covid messaging in cities across China. Then mailbag questions, beginning with a listener’s request for context on China&#39;s relationships with Japan, Vietnam, Korea and Australia. From there: America’s non-chip interests in Taiwan, whether continued unemployment among college grads will lead to more protests, and why the focus on mRNA vaccines is beside the point with reopening looming. At the end: How China might force Western businesses to compromise their values, the various layers of domestic censorship, and the third host (Tashi) joins to discuss the latest adventures of Zhao Lijan. </description>
