    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of &apos;Discover Daily&apos;, we begin with a look at Microsoft. The company is strategically diversifying its AI approach beyond its OpenAI partnership by developing its own AI models, particularly the MAI family. These models have performed nearly as well as leading models from OpenAI and Anthropic on commonly accepted benchmarks and are being considered as potential replacements for OpenAI&apos;s technology in Microsoft&apos;s Copilot AI assistants. Under the leadership of Mustafa Suleyman, who joined Microsoft last year as head of its AI division, the company is also exploring collaborations with other AI companies like xAI, Meta, and DeepSeek to reduce reliance on OpenAI and maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Penn State University graduate student Divya Tyagi has refined a century-old mathematical problem in wind turbine aerodynamics, potentially advancing wind energy science and turbine design efficiency. Her groundbreaking research, published in Wind Energy Science, presents an amendment to Hermann Glauert&apos;s optimum rotor disk solution from the 1920s, offering a more comprehensive mathematical model that provides a realistic depiction of turbine dynamics. Even a 1% increase in power coefficient for large wind turbines could translate to substantial gains in energy output, potentially powering entire communities and leading to more efficient turbine designs for existing wind farms.</p><p>Lastly, in a new study from the University of Cambridge published in Nature, researchers have discovered how aspirin enhances the immune system&apos;s ability to target and combat metastatic cancer cells. The research reveals that aspirin decreases thromboxane A2 production, which normally suppresses T cells&apos; ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. By reducing thromboxane A2 levels, aspirin effectively releases T cells from this suppression, enabling them to recognize and attack cancer cells before they establish metastatic tumors.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of &apos;Discover Daily&apos;, we begin with a look at Microsoft. The company is strategically diversifying its AI approach beyond its OpenAI partnership by developing its own AI models, particularly the MAI family. These models have performed nearly as well as leading models from OpenAI and Anthropic on commonly accepted benchmarks and are being considered as potential replacements for OpenAI&apos;s technology in Microsoft&apos;s Copilot AI assistants. Under the leadership of Mustafa Suleyman, who joined Microsoft last year as head of its AI division, the company is also exploring collaborations with other AI companies like xAI, Meta, and DeepSeek to reduce reliance on OpenAI and maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Penn State University graduate student Divya Tyagi has refined a century-old mathematical problem in wind turbine aerodynamics, potentially advancing wind energy science and turbine design efficiency. Her groundbreaking research, published in Wind Energy Science, presents an amendment to Hermann Glauert&apos;s optimum rotor disk solution from the 1920s, offering a more comprehensive mathematical model that provides a realistic depiction of turbine dynamics. Even a 1% increase in power coefficient for large wind turbines could translate to substantial gains in energy output, potentially powering entire communities and leading to more efficient turbine designs for existing wind farms.</p><p>Lastly, in a new study from the University of Cambridge published in Nature, researchers have discovered how aspirin enhances the immune system&apos;s ability to target and combat metastatic cancer cells. The research reveals that aspirin decreases thromboxane A2 production, which normally suppresses T cells&apos; ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. By reducing thromboxane A2 levels, aspirin effectively releases T cells from this suppression, enabling them to recognize and attack cancer cells before they establish metastatic tumors. This finding was demonstrated in a mouse model of melanoma, where aspirin-treated mice exhibited significantly fewer metastases compared to control subjects.</p><p><br/></p><p>From Perplexity&apos;s Discover Feed:</p><p><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/microsoft-looks-beyond-openai-xcvmz0JyTiipf0BCk8BWgA'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/microsoft-looks-beyond-openai-xcvmz0JyTiipf0BCk8BWgA</a></p><p><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/student-cracks-century-old-mat-wN0I7t44Q8qaalwydsOpEw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/student-cracks-century-old-mat-wN0I7t44Q8qaalwydsOpEw</a></p><p><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/research-shows-how-aspirin-fig-arCADzAVTfOMpVcKvaD5Vg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/research-shows-how-aspirin-fig-arCADzAVTfOMpVcKvaD5Vg</a></p><p><br/></p><p>**<b>Introducing Perplexity Deep R</b></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of &apos;Discover Daily&apos;, we delve into a groundbreaking legal decision involving a $750 million Bitcoin fortune forever lost in a Newport landfill. James Howells&apos; decade-long battle to recover his 8,000 Bitcoin reached a decisive end as Judge Keyser KC dismissed his case, ruling in favor of Newport City Council&apos;s ownership claims. Despite innovative proposals involving AI-powered robots and specialized recovery teams, the massive cryptocurrency cache remains buried, serving as a cautionary tale for digital asset storage.<br/><br/>Meta&apos;s dramatic restructuring of its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs marks a significant shift in corporate culture. The company announced immediate changes to hiring practices, supplier diversity efforts, and employee resource groups, with Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams being reassigned.

James Howells&apos; decade-long battle to recover his 8,000 Bitcoin reached a decisive end as Judge Keyser KC dismissed his case, ruling in favor of Newport City Council&apos;s ownership claims. Despite innovative proposals involving AI-powered robots and specialized recovery teams, the massive cryptocurrency cache remains buried, serving as a cautionary tale for digital asset storage.<br/><br/>Meta&apos;s dramatic restructuring of its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs marks a significant shift in corporate culture. The company announced immediate changes to hiring practices, supplier diversity efforts, and employee resource groups, with Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams being reassigned. This sweeping overhaul, effective January 10, 2025, aligns with similar moves by other major corporations and reflects responses to recent Supreme Court decisions and evolving legal landscapes.<br/><br/>The episode culminates with an exploration of MIT&apos;s revolutionary advancement in computer chip technology.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of Discover Daily, we explore groundbreaking developments in AI and energy sectors that are reshaping our technological landscape. OpenAI&apos;s dramatic shift towards superintelligence development, following their recent governance crisis and controversial move to a for-profit structure, signals a new chapter in artificial intelligence. CEO Sam Altman&apos;s vision of AI agents joining the workforce by 2025 presents both opportunities and challenges for the future of work.<br/><br/>The U.S. government&apos;s historic $840 million nuclear power contract with Constellation marks a significant step towards sustainable energy solutions for AI operations.

This revolutionary model features enhanced reasoning capabilities, improved coding abilities, and innovative chain-of-thought processing.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of DIscover Daily, we begin with the European Union&apos;s ambitious response to Starlink takes center stage as we explore IRIS², a groundbreaking 10.6 billion euro satellite constellation project. Set to launch 290 satellites by 2030, this initiative promises to revolutionize global secure communications while establishing Europe&apos;s technological sovereignty in space.

The system, capable of producing 60-second videos from text descriptions, has already influenced major industry decisions, including Tyler Perry&apos;s pause on an $800 million studio expansion. Available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, Sora enters a competitive market alongside established players like Runway and Kuaishou.<br/><br/>We also cover Bitcoin&apos;s historic milestone of surpassing $100,000, trading at $103,555 - a 140% increase since January. This surge is driven by spot Bitcoin ETF approvals attracting billions from institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell&apos;s repositioning of Bitcoin as a gold competitor rather than a dollar alternative marks a significant shift in perspective, while countries like El Salvador report substantial profits from their Bitcoin adoption.<br/><br/>The episode culminates with China&apos;s discovery of what could be the world&apos;s largest gold deposit in the Wangu goldfield of Hunan Province. This massive find contains 40 gold ore veins across 2 square kilometers, with exceptional ore quality averaging 8.13 grams per ton - far exceeding the global average.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In today&apos;s episode of Discover Daily, we explore OpenAI&apos;s release of Sora, their new text-to-video generation tool that&apos;s creating waves in the creative industry. The system, capable of producing 60-second videos from text descriptions, has already influenced major industry decisions, including Tyler Perry&apos;s pause on an $800 million studio expansion. Available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, Sora enters a competitive market alongside established players like Runway and Kuaishou.<br/><br/>We also cover Bitcoin&apos;s historic milestone of surpassing $100,000, trading at $103,555 - a 140% increase since January. This surge is driven by spot Bitcoin ETF approvals attracting billions from institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell&apos;s repositioning of Bitcoin as a gold competitor rather than a dollar alternative marks a significant shift in perspective, while countries like El Salvador report substantial profits from their Bitcoin adoption.<br/><br/>The episode culminates with China&apos;s discovery of what could be the world&apos;s largest gold deposit in the Wangu goldfield of Hunan Province. This massive find contains 40 gold ore veins across 2 square kilometers, with exceptional ore quality averaging 8.13 grams per ton - far exceeding the global average.

Nicknamed &quot;W,&quot; this marks Meta&apos;s first exclusively owned undersea infrastructure. This massive project will connect multiple continents in a W-shaped pattern, linking the U.S. East Coast to India via South Africa, then to Australia and finally returning to the U.S. West Coast. The project, set to begin operations around 2029, represents Meta&apos;s strategic move to enhance global connectivity and reduce dependence on third-party networks.<br/><br/>Scientists have made a breakthrough discovery in feline genetics, identifying the specific mutation responsible for orange fur in cats. The research reveals a 5 kb deletion in the Arhgap36 gene on the X chromosome that affects how pigments are distributed in cat hair follicles.

Nicknamed &quot;W,&quot; this marks Meta&apos;s first exclusively owned undersea infrastructure. This massive project will connect multiple continents in a W-shaped pattern, linking the U.S. East Coast to India via South Africa, then to Australia and finally returning to the U.S. West Coast. The project, set to begin operations around 2029, represents Meta&apos;s strategic move to enhance global connectivity and reduce dependence on third-party networks.<br/><br/>Scientists have made a breakthrough discovery in feline genetics, identifying the specific mutation responsible for orange fur in cats. The research reveals a 5 kb deletion in the Arhgap36 gene on the X chromosome that affects how pigments are distributed in cat hair follicles. This finding explains why orange cats have RNA levels 13 times higher than cats of other colors, and why approximately 80% of orange cats are male.<br/><br/>Our deep dive explores the fascinating scenario of what would happen if humans suddenly vanished from Earth.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have unearthed the world&apos;s oldest known alphabetic writing in Syria, dating back to 2400 BCE. Found in a non-royal tomb at Tell Umm-el Marra, these perforated clay cylinders with etched writing predate previous alphabetic scripts by 500 years, challenging long-held beliefs about the origins and democratization of written communication.<br/><br/>We then move deep beneath the Indian Ocean where a mysterious &quot;gravity hole&quot; lies. Known as the Indian Ocean Geoid Low (IOGL), it&apos;s where Earth&apos;s gravitational pull is significantly weaker than surrounding areas.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have unearthed the world&apos;s oldest known alphabetic writing in Syria, dating back to 2400 BCE. Found in a non-royal tomb at Tell Umm-el Marra, these perforated clay cylinders with etched writing predate previous alphabetic scripts by 500 years, challenging long-held beliefs about the origins and democratization of written communication.<br/><br/>We then move deep beneath the Indian Ocean where a mysterious &quot;gravity hole&quot; lies. Known as the Indian Ocean Geoid Low (IOGL), it&apos;s where Earth&apos;s gravitational pull is significantly weaker than surrounding areas. Recent computer simulations by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science have traced its origins to about 20 million years ago, revealing how the ancient Tethys Ocean&apos;s disappearance and complex mantle dynamics created this unique geological feature.Today&apos;s episode explores how these discoveries reshape our understanding of human communication and Earth&apos;s internal structure. <br/><br/>From the democratization of writing in ancient Syria to the complex geological processes affecting modern navigation and climate patterns, these findings offer fresh perspectives on our planet&apos;s past and present.<br/><br/>From Perplexity&apos;s <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>: <br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/oldest-alphabetic-writing-disc-U3uvSSYuQnOHpilq92XXcw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/oldest-alphabetic-writing-disc-U3uvSSYuQnOHpilq92XXcw</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/indian-ocean-gravity-hole-MAufXi4SQy.OjFmBrQuOJg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/indian-ocean-gravity-hole-MAufXi4SQy.OjFmBrQuOJg</a><br/><br/></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

Scientists have dated this single-celled organism from which all modern life descends, to 4.2 billion years ago - just 400 million years after Earth&apos;s formation. This ancient organism possessed remarkable complexity, including 2,600 protein-coding genes, a sophisticated immune system with 19 CRISPR genes, and the ability to perform complex metabolic processes near hydrothermal vents in Earth&apos;s earliest oceans. <br/><br/>Despite living during Earth&apos;s most violent period, when the planet was bombarded by meteorites and dominated by volcanic activity, LUCA thrived in an environment without oxygen, converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into energy. Its genome was comparable in size to modern bacteria, challenging our understanding of how quickly complex life can develop. LUCA existed within a diverse ecosystem alongside other microbes and viruses, suggesting that biological diversity emerged much earlier than previously thought.<br/><br/>Recent genetic analysis reveals that LUCA&apos;s cellular machinery, while simpler than modern organisms, established the fundamental blueprint for all life on Earth. This discovery has significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, suggesting that complex organisms might emerge quickly under suitable conditions.

Scientists have dated this single-celled organism from which all modern life descends, to 4.2 billion years ago - just 400 million years after Earth&apos;s formation. This ancient organism possessed remarkable complexity, including 2,600 protein-coding genes, a sophisticated immune system with 19 CRISPR genes, and the ability to perform complex metabolic processes near hydrothermal vents in Earth&apos;s earliest oceans. <br/><br/>Despite living during Earth&apos;s most violent period, when the planet was bombarded by meteorites and dominated by volcanic activity, LUCA thrived in an environment without oxygen, converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into energy. Its genome was comparable in size to modern bacteria, challenging our understanding of how quickly complex life can develop. LUCA existed within a diverse ecosystem alongside other microbes and viruses, suggesting that biological diversity emerged much earlier than previously thought.<br/><br/>Recent genetic analysis reveals that LUCA&apos;s cellular machinery, while simpler than modern organisms, established the fundamental blueprint for all life on Earth. This discovery has significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, suggesting that complex organisms might emerge quickly under suitable conditions. Understanding LUCA&apos;s ancient immune system and metabolic pathways could also lead to new approaches in fighting disease and developing industrial processes.<br/><br/>From Perplexity&apos;s <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>:<br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-last-universal-common-ance-F_o_WexZSEmFZFKgVykYzQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-last-universal-common-ance-F_o_WexZSEmFZFKgVykYzQ</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

Running entirely on a large language model, this groundbreaking game generates its Minecraft-like world in real-time, offering a unique glimpse into the future of gaming despite current technical limitations.<br/><br/>We also investigate the concerning trend of &quot;ghost jobs&quot; flooding the job market, with an estimated 70% of current listings potentially being positions companies have no immediate plans to fill. As this practice reaches new heights in the consulting industry and tech sector, we examine how governments are beginning to take action, with Ontario implementing new transparency rules and New Jersey considering similar legislation.<br/><br/>Our deep dive explores the fascinating Silurian Hypothesis, which questions whether humans were truly Earth&apos;s first technological civilization. This thought-provoking theory examines how we might detect evidence of an ancient industrial society through chemical and isotopic signatures, while highlighting the challenges of preservation over geological timescales. From cephalopod intelligence to potential evidence on the Moon and Mars, we uncover how this hypothesis is reshaping our understanding of Earth&apos;s deep history.<br/><br/>From Perplexity <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>: <br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/world-s-first-ai-generated-vid-ciMFuqV1SIC1niyYfXVYbg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/world-s-first-ai-generated-vid-ciMFuqV1SIC1niyYfXVYbg</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ghost-jobs-flood-the-market-8hipOZEuQTGr_7kmxhthHQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ghost-jobs-flood-the-market-8hipOZEuQTGr_7kmxhthHQ</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-silurian-hypothesis-iMUzeEJvRj.nWTJ1ZjJ6QA'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-silurian-hypothesis-iMUzeEJvRj.nWTJ1ZjJ6QA</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

Running entirely on a large language model, this groundbreaking game generates its Minecraft-like world in real-time, offering a unique glimpse into the future of gaming despite current technical limitations.<br/><br/>We also investigate the concerning trend of &quot;ghost jobs&quot; flooding the job market, with an estimated 70% of current listings potentially being positions companies have no immediate plans to fill. As this practice reaches new heights in the consulting industry and tech sector, we examine how governments are beginning to take action, with Ontario implementing new transparency rules and New Jersey considering similar legislation.<br/><br/>Our deep dive explores the fascinating Silurian Hypothesis, which questions whether humans were truly Earth&apos;s first technological civilization. This thought-provoking theory examines how we might detect evidence of an ancient industrial society through chemical and isotopic signatures, while highlighting the challenges of preservation over geological timescales. From cephalopod intelligence to potential evidence on the Moon and Mars, we uncover how this hypothesis is reshaping our understanding of Earth&apos;s deep history.<br/><br/>From Perplexity <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>: <br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/world-s-first-ai-generated-vid-ciMFuqV1SIC1niyYfXVYbg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/world-s-first-ai-generated-vid-ciMFuqV1SIC1niyYfXVYbg</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ghost-jobs-flood-the-market-8hipOZEuQTGr_7kmxhthHQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ghost-jobs-flood-the-market-8hipOZEuQTGr_7kmxhthHQ</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-silurian-hypothesis-iMUzeEJvRj.nWTJ1ZjJ6QA'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-silurian-hypothesis-iMUzeEJvRj.nWTJ1ZjJ6QA</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

This finding could reshape our understanding of memory formation and lead to new approaches in medical treatment, particularly in areas like cancer therapy and cognitive enhancement.<br/><br/>From Perplexity&apos;s <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>:<br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/tsmc-halts-chinese-chip-shipme-39_kCgDDRcCbPgdSZSz_7Q'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/tsmc-halts-chinese-chip-shipme-39_kCgDDRcCbPgdSZSz_7Q</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/beatles-make-ai-history-with-g-fDkDUu44R1aKe4cjqjuYGw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/beatles-make-ai-history-with-g-fDkDUu44R1aKe4cjqjuYGw</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-body-stores-memories-VlSa1wkRR4yzuqA4OhtG0g'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-body-stores-memories-VlSa1wkRR4yzuqA4OhtG0g</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

Recent scientific investigations reveal these massive holes, measuring up to 230 feet across and 160 feet deep, are caused by climate change triggering explosive releases of methane gas. As Arctic temperatures rise, surface ice melt travels into underground pockets of unfrozen, salty soil called cryopegs. This builds up immense pressure over years until it cracks the permafrost above and triggers sudden explosive methane releases, forming huge craters.<br/><br/>The hosts also discuss a discovery by chemists at UCLA who have upended a century-old rule in organic chemistry. By successfully synthesizing molecules that were thought to be impossible under Bredt&apos;s Rule, the researchers have opened up exciting new possibilities for drug discovery and materials science.

Using machine learning to analyze bacterial genomes, scientists uncovered deterministic patterns in how genes interact and evolve over time.

By retracing your imaginary steps, you can easily recall the information in the order you placed it.Sienna explores the science behind this technique, revealing how it takes advantage of our brain&apos;s natural ability to remember spatial information and transforms abstract data into vivid, location-based images. She shares studies that demonstrate the method&apos;s effectiveness in improving both short-term and long-term memory, and discusses its wide-ranging applications, from students memorizing complex academic material to memory champions recalling thousands of digits of pi.<br/><br/>While the Method of Loci has been around for centuries, Sienna highlights its relevance in the modern world. She shares creative ways to adapt this technique for various subjects and learning scenarios, from creating subject-specific memory palaces to using virtual reality to build immersive memory spaces. Sienna also discusses the importance of training our natural memory abilities in an age where information is always at our fingertips, emphasizing how the Method of Loci can help keep our minds sharp and allow us to engage more deeply with the information we learn.<br/><br/>From Perplexity&apos;s <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>: <br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-method-of-loci-lKScL8YTQkqwUKzeSSVc.A'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/the-method-of-loci-lKScL8YTQkqwUKzeSSVc.A</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

As humanity inches up the scale, currently ranking at Type 0.7276, the implications for our future energy usage and potential for cosmic expansion are staggering. Sienna breaks down the original three types of civilizations proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964, explaining the mind-boggling energy requirements for each level and putting Earth&apos;s current status into perspective. <br/><br/>Sienna explores a recent study in Nature that projects Earth&apos;s advancement to Type 0.7449 by 2060, representing a growth of over 50% in global energy consumption within the next 40 years. She discusses the potential impact of game-changing technologies like nuclear fusion and the need for continued research and investment in advanced energy solutions. However, the Kardashev Scale&apos;s limitations and criticisms are also addressed, including its narrow focus on energy consumption and the ecological concerns surrounding such massive energy usage.<br/><br/>Beyond the scientific implications, Sienna delves into the philosophical questions raised by the Kardashev Scale. As we grapple with the long-term trajectory of our civilization, will we continue to prioritize increasing energy consumption, or will we find a more balanced, sustainable path forward? The scale also holds significance for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), offering a framework for detecting and classifying potential alien civilizations based on their energy signatures.

These  AR glasses boast impressive hardware improvements, including a larger field of view, powerful processors, and a custom operating system. Snap&apos;s developer-focused approach aims to foster a robust ecosystem of AR applications before targeting consumers. While the Spectacles have received praise for their technological advancements, concerns about battery life and cost have also been raised.<br/><br/>Next, we delve into the revolutionary Tianxing-B battery for electric buses, developed by CATL, the world&apos;s leading battery manufacturer. This technology offers an impressive lifespan of up to 15 years or 1.5 million kilometers, along with the highest energy density in the bus industry. The Tianxing-B battery&apos;s extended lifespan and high energy density could significantly accelerate the adoption of electric buses globally, reducing emissions and improving urban air quality.

However, concerns about user privacy and potential AI misuse remain as these powerful tools are embedded into daily workflows. <br/><br/>Next, we discuss Lucid Motors&apos; plans to launch a more affordable midsize electric SUV, targeting a starting price around $48,000 to compete with the Tesla Model Y. By leveraging its efficiency and advanced EV technology, Lucid aims to offer competitive range and features at a lower price point than its current luxury lineup. The success of this mainstream model will be crucial for Lucid to increase sales volume and work towards profitability amidst ongoing financial challenges.<br/><br/>Finally, we take a deep dive into the unexpected twist in the solving of Bitcoin&apos;s 66-bit puzzle.

This innovative technology integrates large language models with robot motion data, allowing household robots to adapt to new tasks and environments more efficiently.<br/><br/>For our deep dive, we examine Bill Gates&apos; vision of a three-day workweek enabled by artificial intelligence. Gates believes that AI-driven productivity gains could lead to a society where people work less and machines handle more mundane tasks. We discuss the potential benefits, challenges, and implications of this futuristic concept, including its impact on employee earnings, job security, and the overall structure of work in an AI-enhanced future.<br/><br/>From Perplexity&apos;s <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>:<br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/us-dominates-olympic-medal-tab-6w4Kr9XjQgyLzELEto6kXg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/us-dominates-olympic-medal-tab-6w4Kr9XjQgyLzELEto6kXg</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/teslas-giga-train-begins-opera-JbpqImJfQP.XF8ij.YFDEw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/teslas-giga-train-begins-opera-JbpqImJfQP.XF8ij.YFDEw</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/mits-algorithm-for-self-traini-Lewzl1W_RfusEK8Lpd6VTw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/mits-algorithm-for-self-traini-Lewzl1W_RfusEK8Lpd6VTw</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/bill-gates-on-the-3-day-workwe-roA3WR9cTQiJEH8wDljTmg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/bill-gates-on-the-3-day-workwe-roA3WR9cTQiJEH8wDljTmg</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

This innovative technology integrates large language models with robot motion data, allowing household robots to adapt to new tasks and environments more efficiently.<br/><br/>For our deep dive, we examine Bill Gates&apos; vision of a three-day workweek enabled by artificial intelligence. Gates believes that AI-driven productivity gains could lead to a society where people work less and machines handle more mundane tasks. We discuss the potential benefits, challenges, and implications of this futuristic concept, including its impact on employee earnings, job security, and the overall structure of work in an AI-enhanced future.<br/><br/>From Perplexity&apos;s <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/discover'>Discover Feed</a>:<br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/us-dominates-olympic-medal-tab-6w4Kr9XjQgyLzELEto6kXg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/us-dominates-olympic-medal-tab-6w4Kr9XjQgyLzELEto6kXg</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/teslas-giga-train-begins-opera-JbpqImJfQP.XF8ij.YFDEw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/teslas-giga-train-begins-opera-JbpqImJfQP.XF8ij.YFDEw</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/mits-algorithm-for-self-traini-Lewzl1W_RfusEK8Lpd6VTw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/mits-algorithm-for-self-traini-Lewzl1W_RfusEK8Lpd6VTw</a><br/><br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/bill-gates-on-the-3-day-workwe-roA3WR9cTQiJEH8wDljTmg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/bill-gates-on-the-3-day-workwe-roA3WR9cTQiJEH8wDljTmg</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of Discover Daily by Perplexity, we explore groundbreaking AI achievements in mathematics, a new AI search engine, and efforts to combat technological cheating in sports. </p><p>Google DeepMind&apos;s AI systems, AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, made history at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad, solving four out of six problems and earning a silver medal-level performance. This marks the first time an AI has reached the podium in this prestigious competition. We delve into the innovative approaches used by these AI models, including language processing, reinforcement learning, and neuro-symbolic techniques.</p><p>Next, we discuss OpenAI&apos;s unveiling of SearchGPT, a prototype AI-powered search engine designed to provide fast, timely answers with clear attribution to sources. This new service aims to challenge traditional search platforms and AI-driven competitors. We examine how SearchGPT combines AI models with real-time web information, its partnerships with major news organizations, and its potential impact on the search engine market dominated by Google.</p><p>Finally, we cover two important topics: efforts to combat &quot;motor doping&quot; in cycling at the Paris Olympics and the US Senate&apos;s unanimous passing of the DEFIANCE Act.

This marks the first time an AI has reached the podium in this prestigious competition. We delve into the innovative approaches used by these AI models, including language processing, reinforcement learning, and neuro-symbolic techniques.</p><p>Next, we discuss OpenAI&apos;s unveiling of SearchGPT, a prototype AI-powered search engine designed to provide fast, timely answers with clear attribution to sources. This new service aims to challenge traditional search platforms and AI-driven competitors. We examine how SearchGPT combines AI models with real-time web information, its partnerships with major news organizations, and its potential impact on the search engine market dominated by Google.</p><p>Finally, we cover two important topics: efforts to combat &quot;motor doping&quot; in cycling at the Paris Olympics and the US Senate&apos;s unanimous passing of the DEFIANCE Act. Olympic officials are deploying advanced technology, including electromagnetic scanners and X-ray imaging, to detect hidden electric motors in bicycles.

Using advanced AI models and fMRI scans, this technology opens up exciting possibilities for communication aids, dream interpretation, and understanding visual perception across species. We also delve into the history of AI, examining the first AI winter from 1974 to 1980, a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research that shaped the field&apos;s future trajectory.<br/><br/>We then turn our attention to China&apos;s booming AI sector, specifically the &quot;War of a Hundred Models&quot; in large language models (LLMs). With at least 130 LLMs accounting for 40% of the global total, China&apos;s tech giants and startups are fiercely competing in this space. However, this rapid growth has led to concerns about resource allocation, practical applications, and market sustainability, potentially leading to significant consolidation in the future.<br/><br/>Finally, we explore the inspiring story of Amazon&apos;s early days. From its humble beginnings as an online bookstore in Jeff Bezos&apos;s garage to becoming a global e-commerce giant, Amazon&apos;s journey is filled with fascinating details. We uncover clever workarounds for inventory challenges, the evolution of its iconic logo, and the rapid growth that saw the company selling to all 50 U.S. states within months of launching.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of Discover Daily, we explored several cutting-edge developments in technology and conservation efforts. We began with the concerning discovery of the &quot;Skeleton Key&quot; technique by Microsoft researchers, which can bypass safety measures in multiple generative AI models. This method manipulates AI systems into ignoring their built-in safety protocols, potentially allowing harmful or restricted information to be extracted. Testing revealed that several prominent AI models from companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others were vulnerable to this technique.<br/><br/>We then looked into Japan&apos;s ambitious Autoflow-Road project, a 310-mile automated conveyor belt system designed to revolutionize freight transportation between Tokyo and Osaka. This innovative system aims to address Japan&apos;s critical shortage of delivery drivers while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Autoflow-Road will utilize existing infrastructure and operate 24/7, potentially replacing the work of 25,000 drivers daily. This project is a response to Japan&apos;s aging population and declining birth rate, which is expected to cause a significant drop in the number of delivery drivers by 2030.<br/><br/>Finally, we discussed the Rhisotope Project in South Africa, a groundbreaking effort to combat rhino poaching. This innovative approach involves injecting radioactive material into live rhino horns, making them detectable by radiation sensors at international borders. The project aims to deter smuggling and reduce demand for rhino horns in traditional medicinal markets. While the project shows promise, it has faced ethical concerns and skepticism.

We began with the concerning discovery of the &quot;Skeleton Key&quot; technique by Microsoft researchers, which can bypass safety measures in multiple generative AI models. This method manipulates AI systems into ignoring their built-in safety protocols, potentially allowing harmful or restricted information to be extracted. Testing revealed that several prominent AI models from companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others were vulnerable to this technique.<br/><br/>We then looked into Japan&apos;s ambitious Autoflow-Road project, a 310-mile automated conveyor belt system designed to revolutionize freight transportation between Tokyo and Osaka. This innovative system aims to address Japan&apos;s critical shortage of delivery drivers while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Autoflow-Road will utilize existing infrastructure and operate 24/7, potentially replacing the work of 25,000 drivers daily. This project is a response to Japan&apos;s aging population and declining birth rate, which is expected to cause a significant drop in the number of delivery drivers by 2030.<br/><br/>Finally, we discussed the Rhisotope Project in South Africa, a groundbreaking effort to combat rhino poaching. This innovative approach involves injecting radioactive material into live rhino horns, making them detectable by radiation sensors at international borders. The project aims to deter smuggling and reduce demand for rhino horns in traditional medicinal markets. While the project shows promise, it has faced ethical concerns and skepticism.

We begin by delving into the puzzling absence of waves on Saturn&apos;s moon Titan, where despite evidence of wind and rainfall, radar data from NASA&apos;s Cassini spacecraft has revealed eerily smooth lakes. Researchers propose that the cold, heavy air during Titan&apos;s northern winter may have been insufficient to generate waves, but as the moon approaches its summer solstice, climate models predict an increase in wind activity that could lead to the formation of waves and potentially shape the morphology of Titan&apos;s coastlines.<br/><br/>Next, we discuss China&apos;s historic success in collecting and returning the first-ever samples from the moon&apos;s far side through its groundbreaking Chang&apos;e 6 mission. The approximately two kilograms of lunar rock and soil collected from the Apollo crater within the South Pole–Aitken Basin are expected to provide valuable insights into the moon&apos;s geological history and the differences between its near and far sides. This achievement marks a significant milestone in planetary science and underscores China&apos;s growing prowess in space exploration, positioning the country as a formidable competitor in the new space race.<br/><br/>Finally, we cover Volkswagen Group&apos;s substantial investment of up to 5 billion dollars in U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian. This strategic financial commitment, structured in multiple phases, aims to accelerate the development of software-defined vehicles and cutting-edge electric vehicle technology through a 50/50 joint venture. The collaboration addresses challenges faced by both traditional automakers and EV startups, combining Volkswagen&apos;s manufacturing expertise with Rivian&apos;s innovative approach to electric vehicle design and software development.

Moving to the cosmos, astronomers have witnessed the dramatic awakening of a supermassive black hole in the galaxy SDSS1335+0728, which suddenly began emitting intense light in late 2019 after years of tranquility[9].

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of Discover Daily, we explore the latest developments in tech and social media. YouTube is testing a new feature called &quot;notes&quot; that allows users to add community-generated context to videos, providing additional information and clarifying when content may be outdated, misleading, or a parody. The US government has filed a lawsuit against Adobe, accusing the software giant of concealing cancellation fees and making it difficult for customers to terminate their subscriptions. We also discuss US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&apos;s bold proposal to implement tobacco-style warning labels on social media platforms, citing the potential mental health risks associated with their use, especially among adolescents.<br/><br/>In other news, McDonald&apos;s has announced the discontinuation of its AI-powered drive-thru ordering system after a two-year partnership with IBM. The fast-food giant cites inaccuracies and customer frustration as reasons for halting the AI technology, which was intended to expedite the ordering process. Despite the setback, McDonald&apos;s remains optimistic about the future of voice ordering solutions and plans to evaluate long-term, scalable options.<br/><br/>As social media continues to shape our daily lives, it is crucial to address the potential risks and challenges that come with these platforms. From YouTube&apos;s efforts to combat misinformation through community-sourced context to the US government&apos;s actions against deceptive business practices and the call for mental health warnings, this episode highlights the importance of fostering a safer and more transparent online environment.

We also discuss US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&apos;s bold proposal to implement tobacco-style warning labels on social media platforms, citing the potential mental health risks associated with their use, especially among adolescents.<br/><br/>In other news, McDonald&apos;s has announced the discontinuation of its AI-powered drive-thru ordering system after a two-year partnership with IBM. The fast-food giant cites inaccuracies and customer frustration as reasons for halting the AI technology, which was intended to expedite the ordering process. Despite the setback, McDonald&apos;s remains optimistic about the future of voice ordering solutions and plans to evaluate long-term, scalable options.<br/><br/>As social media continues to shape our daily lives, it is crucial to address the potential risks and challenges that come with these platforms. From YouTube&apos;s efforts to combat misinformation through community-sourced context to the US government&apos;s actions against deceptive business practices and the call for mental health warnings, this episode highlights the importance of fostering a safer and more transparent online environment.

Elon Musk&apos;s sudden withdrawal of his lawsuit against OpenAI takes center stage, with the billionaire entrepreneur accusing the AI research company of deviating from its original mission. We also look into the shocking story of a Turkish student arrested for using AI to cheat on a university entrance exam, highlighting the increasing sophistication of AI-based cheating methods.<br/><br/>Apple&apos;s stock surge to record highs following its AI-focused World Wide Developers Conference event is another major story. The company&apos;s shares rose over 7% on Tuesday, reaching a record high and closing in on Microsoft&apos;s position as the world&apos;s most valuable company. We also take a look at the Light Phone 3, a minimalist smartphone designed to help users disconnect from the constant distractions of modern technology. This device offers a refreshingly simple experience, with a focus on essential features like calling, texting, and basic web browsing.<br/><br/>Finally, we explore the groundbreaking launch of the world&apos;s first wooden satellite, LignoSat, set to take place this September.

Elon Musk&apos;s sudden withdrawal of his lawsuit against OpenAI takes center stage, with the billionaire entrepreneur accusing the AI research company of deviating from its original mission. We also look into the shocking story of a Turkish student arrested for using AI to cheat on a university entrance exam, highlighting the increasing sophistication of AI-based cheating methods.<br/><br/>Apple&apos;s stock surge to record highs following its AI-focused World Wide Developers Conference event is another major story. The company&apos;s shares rose over 7% on Tuesday, reaching a record high and closing in on Microsoft&apos;s position as the world&apos;s most valuable company. We also take a look at the Light Phone 3, a minimalist smartphone designed to help users disconnect from the constant distractions of modern technology. This device offers a refreshingly simple experience, with a focus on essential features like calling, texting, and basic web browsing.<br/><br/>Finally, we explore the groundbreaking launch of the world&apos;s first wooden satellite, LignoSat, set to take place this September. This innovative satellite, crafted from magnolia wood, aims to reduce the environmental impact of satellite reentries and inspire the use of wood in future space structures.

We begin with Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, who revealed a substantial position in GameStop valued at around $200 million, reigniting interest in the meme stock phenomenon.

From the groundbreaking development of a new AI-driven streaming service called Showrunner to the alarming melting of Antarctica&apos;s &quot;Doomsday Glacier,&quot; and from the unprecedented success of a new lung cancer drug trial to the rise and fall of the ghost kitchen industry, this episode covers a diverse array of stories that are sure to pique your curiosity.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting developments discussed in this episode is the launch of Showrunner, an innovative streaming platform that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to enable users to create their own animated shows. By providing simple text prompts, users can control various aspects of the show, such as dialogue, characters, and shot types, while the AI takes care of the writing, voicing, and animation. This revolutionary approach to content creation has the potential to disrupt the entertainment industry, but it also raises important questions about the role of human creators and the use of copyrighted materials.<br/><br/>Another highlight of the episode is the discussion of a recent experiment that simulated a wormhole using quantum computers. While the simulated wormhole is not a physical one, the experiment supports the holographic principle, which suggests that space-time and gravity could emerge from quantum effects. This groundbreaking work provides a new way to study quantum gravity in a laboratory setting and opens up new avenues for exploring fundamental questions about the universe using quantum computing.<br/><br/><b>Pages from Perplexity&apos;s Discover feed:<br/></b><br/>New streaming service with AI shows<br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Streaming-Service-2Lpd0h2xSYuQz8Tq7OQK3g'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Streaming-Service-2Lpd0h2xSYuQz8Tq7OQK3g</a></p><p><b>Universe Wormholes Simulation Experiment<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Universe-Wormholes-Simulation-WUoAJ3CDREaEXZrOC2WAgw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Universe-Wormholes-Simulation-WUoAJ3CDREaEXZrOC2WAgw</a></p><p><b>New Lung Cancer Drug Trial Success<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Lung-Cancer-8pW4sw6jQ8yEhqwgpWKhwQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Lung-Cancer-8pW4sw6jQ8yEhqwgpWKhwQ</a></p><p><b>Antarctica&apos;s Doomsday Glacier Is Melting<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Antarcticas-Doomsday-Glacier-GCsIsjl_TpSAVEBXRtlo.A'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Antarcticas-Doomsday-Glacier-GCsIsjl_TpSAVEBXRtlo.A</a></p><p><b>The Fall of Ghost Kitchens<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/The-Fall-of-eRj.SMPZSLyVWXcRjg8G5A'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/The-Fall-of-eRj.SMPZSLyVWXcRjg8G5A</a></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

This groundbreaking work provides a new way to study quantum gravity in a laboratory setting and opens up new avenues for exploring fundamental questions about the universe using quantum computing.<br/><br/><b>Pages from Perplexity&apos;s Discover feed:<br/></b><br/>New streaming service with AI shows<br/><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Streaming-Service-2Lpd0h2xSYuQz8Tq7OQK3g'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Streaming-Service-2Lpd0h2xSYuQz8Tq7OQK3g</a></p><p><b>Universe Wormholes Simulation Experiment<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Universe-Wormholes-Simulation-WUoAJ3CDREaEXZrOC2WAgw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Universe-Wormholes-Simulation-WUoAJ3CDREaEXZrOC2WAgw</a></p><p><b>New Lung Cancer Drug Trial Success<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Lung-Cancer-8pW4sw6jQ8yEhqwgpWKhwQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/New-Lung-Cancer-8pW4sw6jQ8yEhqwgpWKhwQ</a></p><p><b>Antarctica&apos;s Doomsday Glacier Is Melting<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Antarcticas-Doomsday-Glacier-GCsIsjl_TpSAVEBXRtlo.A'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Antarcticas-Doomsday-Glacier-GCsIsjl_TpSAVEBXRtlo.A</a></p><p><b>The Fall of Ghost Kitchens<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/page/The-Fall-of-eRj.SMPZSLyVWXcRjg8G5A'>https://www.perplexity.ai/page/The-Fall-of-eRj.SMPZSLyVWXcRjg8G5A</a></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

The botnet, managed by YunHe Wang, hacked into over 19 million IP addresses globally, using malicious VPN applications to push malware onto victims&apos; devices.<br/><br/>Next, we explore Mistral AI&apos;s launch of Codestral, a generative AI model designed to assist developers in writing and interacting with code across more than 80 programming languages. This model, with its high performance and broad language support, is set to revolutionize the coding process by completing coding functions, writing tests, and filling in partial code. We also discuss BYD&apos;s new plug-in hybrid sedans, the Qin L and Seal 06, which boast an impressive driving range of over 1,300 miles on a single tank of fuel and a fully charged battery, thanks to their advanced DM-i 5.0 plug-in hybrid platform.<br/><br/>We then dive into the innovative use of cosmic rays to date archaeological sites, highlighting a prehistoric settlement in northern Greece dated to between 5328 and 5140 BC. This method combines dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating with the identification of cosmic ray events, providing precise chronological reference points. Finally, we address the global myopia epidemic, discussing its causes, consequences, and preventive measures.

This discovery, made by an international team of astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope, provides evidence that black hole mergers were already occurring at such an early stage in the Universe&apos;s history, suggesting that merging is a crucial mechanism for the rapid growth of black holes, even at cosmic dawn.</p><p><b>From Perplexity’s Discover feed:</b></p><p><b>Taiwan Semiconductor remote kill switch<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Taiwan-Semiconductor-remote-AItFxJqCQz6ox.4E2ai2xw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Taiwan-Semiconductor-remote-AItFxJqCQz6ox.4E2ai2xw</a></p><p><b>EU approves world-first AI rules<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/EU-approves-worldfirst-Wa_qktYlRViDx.cyFwN2Fw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/EU-approves-worldfirst-Wa_qktYlRViDx.cyFwN2Fw</a></p><p><b>Volvo&apos;s autonomous semi truck<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Volvos-autonomous-semi-4kURfQZ1TKa1uKOQK0x71Q'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Volvos-autonomous-semi-4kURfQZ1TKa1uKOQK0x71Q</a></p><p><b>Light-based computer chips<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Lightbased-computer-chips-JG7W.mmeSxKsMZt6sZXypQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Lightbased-computer-chips-JG7W.mmeSxKsMZt6sZXypQ</a></p><p><b>Oldest black hole merger observed<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Oldest-black-hole-OHsGLMCSTwSdzDKnXyJR1w'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Oldest-black-hole-OHsGLMCSTwSdzDKn</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

I&apos;m your host Alex, and in today&apos;s episode, we explore significant changes at OpenAI, a historic milestone for the Dow Jones, the ambitious goals of the Blue Brain Project, the puzzling behavior of orcas in the Strait of Gibraltar, and the evolutionary remnants of goosebumps.<br/><br/>OpenAI has recently disbanded its Superalignment team, raising concerns about the company&apos;s commitment to AI safety. This team was dedicated to ensuring that artificial general intelligence systems remain aligned with human goals. Despite the departure of key figures like Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, OpenAI continues to integrate safety considerations into its broader research efforts. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surpassed the 40,000 mark for the first time, driven by easing inflation and significant gains in technology stocks, particularly those associated with artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>The Blue Brain Project aims to create a digital reconstruction of the mammalian brain, starting with the mouse brain, to understand brain structure and function. Despite its achievements, the project faces challenges such as the complexity of simulations and ethical considerations. Additionally, orcas in the Strait of Gibraltar have resumed ramming yachts, puzzling scientists with their behavior. Lastly, we discuss the evolutionary remnants of goosebumps, a vestigial reflex inherited from our animal ancestors. <br/><br/><b>From Perplexity&apos;s Discover feed:<br/></b><br/><b>OpenAI superalignment team disbanded<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/OpenAI-superalignment-team-xOZoBxnbRY2lNCr1OTMGgg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/OpenAI-superalignment-team-xOZoBxnbRY2lNCr1OTMGgg</a></p><p><b>Dow Jones surpassed 40,000 for the first time<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Dow-Jones-surpassed-F9NwmxNvQKi56gCAugZ7Rg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Dow-Jones-surpassed-F9NwmxNvQKi56gCAugZ7Rg</a></p><p><b>The Blue Brain Project<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/The-Blue-Brain-Hw00mGi0Tn.9ebHfqFVZKg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/The-Blue-Brain-Hw00mGi0Tn.9ebHfqFVZKg</a></p><p><b>Yacht-sinking orcas return<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Yachtsinking-orcas-return-S1_sK9tNRpCYzzWX__wryw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Yachtsinking-orcas-return-S1_sK9tNRpCYzzWX__wryw</a></p><p><b>Goosebumps are evolutionary remnants<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Goosebumps-are-evolutionary-G2zUCAM5QGuDEKyzbDZRkg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Goosebumps-are-evolutionary-G2zUCAM5QGuDEKyzbDZRkg</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

I&apos;m your host Alex, and in today&apos;s episode, we explore the financial struggles of Stability AI, a new partnership between Reddit and OpenAI, advancements in early cancer detection, the rise of fake science in academic journals, and Hertz&apos;s decision to sell off a significant portion of its electric vehicle fleet.<br/><br/>Stability AI, known for its Stable Diffusion image generator, is considering a sale due to financial difficulties and investor pressure. Despite raising significant funds, the company has struggled to monetize its software amid rising competition. Meanwhile, Reddit and OpenAI have partnered to integrate Reddit&apos;s content into OpenAI&apos;s products, enhancing user engagement and providing financial benefits to both companies. This collaboration aims to improve AI&apos;s contextual understanding and introduce new AI-powered tools for Reddit users.<br/><br/>In the realm of health, recent research has identified proteins in the blood that could serve as early indicators of cancer, potentially years before diagnosis. This discovery could revolutionize cancer prevention and treatment. However, the academic community faces challenges with the rise of fake studies and predatory journals, undermining scientific integrity.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2302487/open_sms">We&#39;re experimenting and would love to hear from you!</a></p><p>In this episode of Discover Daily, we explore a fascinating theory about the formation of Earth&apos;s continents, the potential of space-based solar power, TikTok&apos;s AI-powered search enhancements, the recent volatility of GameStop stock, and the launch of OpenAI&apos;s latest language model, GPT-4o.<br/><br/>The giant impact theory of plate tectonics suggests that massive meteorite impacts during Earth&apos;s early history may have been responsible for the formation of oceanic plates and the initiation of plate tectonics. Space-based solar power, which involves collecting solar energy in space and transmitting it wirelessly to Earth, has seen significant progress in recent years, with technological demonstrations showing promising results.

Space-based solar power, which involves collecting solar energy in space and transmitting it wirelessly to Earth, has seen significant progress in recent years, with technological demonstrations showing promising results.

The discussion then shifts to the U.S. government&apos;s plan to increase tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles from 25% to 100%, a move that could significantly impact the affordability and availability of these vehicles in the American market.<br/><br/>Next, we examine the growing trend of schools using AI technology to detect firearms on their premises, as a proactive measure to enhance safety and security. Companies like ZeroEyes and Iterate AI are at the forefront of this movement, offering AI systems that integrate with existing camera networks to identify potential threats in real-time. We also delve into the intriguing concept of Moravec&apos;s Paradox, which highlights the counterintuitive nature of AI development, where tasks that are simple for humans are often extremely difficult for machines, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Finally, we explore the origins of Mother&apos;s Day in the United States, tracing its roots back to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, who sought to honor her mother&apos;s legacy as a social activist. The first official Mother&apos;s Day took place on May 10, 1908, and in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson established it as a national holiday.

We begin by discussing the recent G4 geomagnetic storm that impacted Earth, causing disturbances in the planet&apos;s magnetic field and potentially affecting power grids and communication systems. The episode then shifts focus to a protest at Tesla&apos;s Gigafactory in Germany, where activists clashed with police over concerns about the environmental impact of the company&apos;s expansion plans and the broader implications of lithium mining for electric vehicle batteries.<br/><br/>Next, we explore the world of online dating, examining Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd&apos;s vision for an AI-powered &quot;dating concierge&quot; that could handle initial interactions between potential partners. While this concept has generated interest, it has also raised questions about the role of AI in human relationships and the ethical considerations surrounding such technology. The episode then celebrates a groundbreaking gene therapy trial that successfully restored hearing to a young British girl, marking the first time this approach has been used to treat auditory neuropathy and offering hope for those with similar genetic hearing conditions.<br/><br/>Finally, we explore the complex history of dog domestication, discussing theories of self-domestication and directed domestication, as well as recent genetic evidence suggesting multiple domestication events in Europe and Asia. The episode highlights the interplay of ecological, genetic, and social factors that have shaped the evolution of dogs from their wolf ancestors and the ongoing debates in the scientific community about the exact timeline and processes involved in this remarkable journey.<br/><br/><b>From Perplexity&apos;s Discover feed:<br/></b><br/><b>Severe geomagnetic storm hits Earth<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Severe-geomagnetic-storm-NcL7m.JiR7qWAsDtmcbDcg'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Severe-geomagnetic-storm-NcL7m.JiR7qWAsDtmcbDcg</a></p><p><b>Protestors storm Tesla Gigafactory<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Protestors-storm-Tesla-sec7yAlFTlS0MFUsoADbTQ'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Protestors-storm-Tesla-sec7yAlFTlS0MFUsoADbTQ</a></p><p><b>Bumble&apos;s AI dating concierge<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Bumbles-AI-dating-HpWEQH6uSG2ZYl8i.0hMGw'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Bumbles-AI-dating-HpWEQH6uSG2ZYl8i.0hMGw</a></p><p><b>Gene therapy trial restores hearing<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Gene-therapy-trial-aKuZbEGbQfurdauGCK5VZA'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Gene-therapy-trial-aKuZbEGbQfurdauGCK5VZA</a></p><p><b>Rethinking dog evolution<br/></b><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Rethinking-dog-evolution-iymMWxN6Tdu_1Er7bDOn5Q'>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Rethi</a></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

First, we look at the U.S. Air Force&apos;s groundbreaking test of an AI-controlled F-16 fighter jet that engaged in a high-speed dogfight, part of plans for over 1,000 AI warplanes by 2028. We also cover the world&apos;s first official music video created entirely with AI video generation from OpenAI&apos;s Sora model for the song &quot;The Hardest Part&quot; by Washed Out.</p><p>The episode then dives into the latest from the world of social media, revealing that Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has quietly stepped down from the board of the decentralized platform Bluesky that he helped create. We examine the implications of this move for Bluesky&apos;s future direction. Finally, we look ahead to Apple&apos;s rumored plans to massively upgrade Siri with advanced AI capabilities in iOS 18, allowing for more natural conversations and complex multi-step voice commands.</p><p>With insights into cutting-edge AI applications across the military, entertainment, social media, and consumer tech sectors, this Discover Daily podcast showcases the rapidly expanding role of artificial intelligence in reshaping numerous industries.

This legislative effort is a tightrope walk over the chasm of innovation and safety, setting new ground rules for AI&apos;s wild west. Developers, take note: your creations now come with a blueprint for safety and accountability. Moreover, we&apos;re celebrating the 60th anniversary of the BASIC programming language, an innovation that flung open the doors of computing to the masses. Whether you&apos;re a tech enthusiast or simply intrigued by astronomical and medical marvels, today&apos;s podcast is a testament to human ingenuity, spotlighting the pioneers who are scripting history with every breakthrough.

We also discuss recent advancements in nuclear clock technology, with researchers making progress using scandium-45 and thorium-229, bringing the development of these highly precise timekeeping devices closer to reality.<br/><br/>The episode also covers the legislative challenges faced by DJI, a leading drone manufacturer, in the United States. The proposed &quot;Countering CCP Drones Act&quot; could effectively ban DJI from using U.S. communications infrastructure, potentially impacting various sectors that rely on DJI drones.

This interconnected AI ecosystem could provide a competitive edge against rivals OpenAI and Anthropic as Musk seeks to create a networked system benefiting all his ventures.<br/><br/>The U.S. government has formed a new Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board under the Department of Homeland Security. This 22-member board includes tech CEOs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and representatives from major companies. Notably absent are social media giants Meta and Twitter. The board will advise on protecting critical infrastructure from potential AI disruptions and help stakeholders use AI responsibly, as emphasized by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Its formation is part of the Biden administration&apos;s efforts to regulate AI.<br/><br/>In the digital media space, Jeff Lawson, co-founder of Twilio, has acquired the satirical news outlet The Onion through his company Global Tetrahedron. Plans include shifting to a subscription model, enhancing social media presence, and reviving projects like The Onion News Network. The acquisition aims to preserve The Onion&apos;s editorial voice while potentially increasing writer compensation.

This decision has been met with praise from consumer advocacy groups but strong opposition from the telecommunications industry.

The company has faced production issues with its Fisker Ocean SUV, workforce reductions, and a plummeting stock price. In the realm of archaeology, researchers have made a significant discovery regarding the burial site of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, utilizing advanced imaging and AI technologies to decipher carbonized papyrus scrolls from Herculaneum.

President Joe Biden&apos;s recent legislative action could force TikTok&apos;s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app or face a ban, stirring up a storm of controversy and debate.

This innovative approach promises to enhance privacy and processing speed, marking a significant shift from cloud-based AI. We&apos;ll discuss the features and capabilities of OpenELM, its integration with iOS 18, and what this means for the future of on-device AI technologies.<br/><br/>Finally, we&apos;ll delve into the fiery realm of robotics with the Thermonator, a flamethrower-equipped robotic dog developed by Throwflame. Built on the Unitree Go1 platform, the Thermonator raises ethical questions and concerns about the weaponization of robotic technologies.

First, we discuss the Limitless AI Pendant, a cutting-edge wearable device that&apos;s revolutionizing productivity and communication. With its compact design, impressive battery life, and privacy-focused features, the Limitless AI Pendant is gaining attention in the AI wearables market. Discover how this device is enhancing video calls, meetings, and personal note-taking, and learn why it&apos;s an improvement over its predecessor, the Humane AI Pin.<br/><br/>Next, we uncover the hidden art of microchip graffiti, a little-known practice that has been a part of the semiconductor industry for decades. Explore the origins and evolution of this unique form of microscopic artwork, from its practical purposes in the early days of chip design to its role as a creative outlet for engineers. Learn about the motivations behind creating chip art, the methods used to etch these tiny masterpieces, and the efforts to preserve this fascinating legacy. Discover how websites like the Silicon Zoo are cataloging and celebrating these miniature wonders, showcasing the whimsical and human side of technology.<br/><br/>Finally, we discuss Microsoft&apos;s $1.5 billion investment in G42, an artificial intelligence and cloud computing company based in Abu Dhabi. This expanded partnership aims to accelerate AI development and build out the UAE&apos;s sovereign cloud capabilities, with G42 leveraging Microsoft&apos;s Azure infrastructure to create AI solutions for various industries. Learn about the joint projects planned by Microsoft and G42, the expansion of Microsoft&apos;s data center presence in the UAE, and the company&apos;s efforts to address concerns about G42&apos;s previous ties to China.

First, we examine TikTok&apos;s use of AI-generated digital avatars for content creation and advertising, offering a cost-effective and engaging way for businesses and creators to produce interactive experiences. Despite concerns surrounding privacy and traditional content creation jobs, TikTok continues to push the boundaries of AI innovation on its platform.</p><p>Next, we discuss the collaboration between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which will see the first non-American astronaut walk on the Moon as part of the Artemis program.

First, we dive into Spotify&apos;s latest AI endeavor: a new feature that allows users to create personalized playlists using prompts. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Spotify aims to revolutionize music discovery and enhance user engagement on its platform. The company&apos;s investment in AI extends beyond this feature, with plans to use generative AI for podcast summarization, audio ad creation, and assisting artists in the music creation process.<br/><br/>Next, we travel to Dubai, where the United Arab Emirates is combating water scarcity through the use of sophisticated cloud seeding technology. By dispersing substances like potassium chloride and sodium chloride into the air, Dubai is stimulating the formation of artificial rain to address the challenges posed by its arid climate. The UAE Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science plays a crucial role in advancing this technology, with recent developments involving the use of electrical charges from drones to manipulate weather and induce rainfall. Finally, we explore the intriguing world of &quot;kamikaze bacteria,&quot; where certain bacteria sacrifice themselves for the benefit of their population by releasing toxins in a self-destructive manner. This discovery not only sheds light on the complex behavior of these microorganisms but also holds promise for the development of new antibiotics and innovative cancer therapies using engineered bacteria.<br/><br/><b>From Perplexity&apos;s Discover feed:</b></p><ul><li><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Spotify-launches-AIprompted-61BqfAzQQCGX.W5fHChmRg'>Spotify launches AI-prompted playlists</a></li><li><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Dubai-artificial-rain-z0Ob756nRgW6S6r.nAriPg'>Dubai artificial rain technology</a></li><li><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Kamikaze-bacteria-explode-Jo6LKzvoShat87Rr1_uk4w'>Kamikaze bacteria explode with toxins</a></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

The company&apos;s investment in AI extends beyond this feature, with plans to use generative AI for podcast summarization, audio ad creation, and assisting artists in the music creation process.<br/><br/>Next, we travel to Dubai, where the United Arab Emirates is combating water scarcity through the use of sophisticated cloud seeding technology. By dispersing substances like potassium chloride and sodium chloride into the air, Dubai is stimulating the formation of artificial rain to address the challenges posed by its arid climate. The UAE Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science plays a crucial role in advancing this technology, with recent developments involving the use of electrical charges from drones to manipulate weather and induce rainfall. Finally, we explore the intriguing world of &quot;kamikaze bacteria,&quot; where certain bacteria sacrifice themselves for the benefit of their population by releasing toxins in a self-destructive manner. This discovery not only sheds light on the complex behavior of these microorganisms but also holds promise for the development of new antibiotics and innovative cancer therapies using engineered bacteria.<br/><br/><b>From Perplexity&apos;s Discover feed:</b></p><ul><li><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Spotify-launches-AIprompted-61BqfAzQQCGX.W5fHChmRg'>Spotify launches AI-prompted playlists</a></li><li><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Dubai-artificial-rain-z0Ob756nRgW6S6r.nAriPg'>Dubai artificial rain technology</a></li><li><a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Kamikaze-bacteria-explode-Jo6LKzvoShat87Rr1_uk4w'>Kamikaze bacteria explode with toxins</a></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><a href='http://perplexity.ai/'>Perplexity</a> is the fastest and most powerful way to search the web.

First, we delve into the U.S. government&apos;s significant $2 billion Bitcoin transfer to Coinbase, connected to the seizure of 50,000 Bitcoin from the notorious Silk Road website. This transfer highlights the intricate relationship between traditional financial institutions, government authorities, and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, while also discussing the potential risks associated with government control over digital currencies, as cautioned by U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>Next, we examine the landmark lawsuit involving the estate of the late comedian George Carlin and the creators of an AI-generated comedy special featuring a clone of Carlin. This case emphasizes the growing concerns surrounding the use of artificial intelligence to impersonate individuals without consent and the potential for future litigation regarding AI-generated content and copyright law. Finally, we explore NASA&apos;s pioneering initiative to establish Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC), a unified standard of time on the moon. As the number of lunar missions continues to rise, the need for a common time reference becomes paramount to ensure precise coordination and communication among future lunar expeditions.

As plot details remain under wraps, fans speculate about the future of this iconic series and the potential return of stars like Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.<br/><br/>Finally, we examine the music industry&apos;s response to the unethical use of AI in music production, as over 200 artists, including Billie Eilish and Pearl Jam, sign an open letter condemning practices that replace human artistry and dilute royalty pools. The letter, organized by the Artist Rights Alliance, urges tech companies and AI developers to pledge not to deploy AI music-generation technology that undermines human creativity and denies fair compensation.

First, we explore the anticipation surrounding Apple&apos;s WWDC 2024, where the company is expected to showcase its latest artificial intelligence (AI) innovations across its software ecosystem, including iOS, macOS, and more. We also discuss the potential for exciting hardware announcements, such as the rumored M3 Ultra chip, which could bring significant performance boosts to high-end Macs. <br/><br/>Next, we turn our attention to the shocking news of WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann&apos;s bid to buy back the bankrupt company he once led.

With a 58.1% stake, Trump stands to potentially earn over $3-4 billion, but faces a 6-month lock-up period before he can sell shares. We examine the details of the deal, Truth Social&apos;s $5B+ valuation, and the investigations that delayed the merger.<br/><br/>Next, we discuss the major leadership shakeup at Boeing as the aerospace giant grapples with ongoing safety issues and a federal investigation. CEO Dave Calhoun announces his resignation amid the fallout from the 737 MAX door blowout incident, while Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal retires immediately and other top executives shift roles. We analyze the challenges Boeing faces in restoring its reputation and addressing deep-rooted cultural problems following the two deadly 737 MAX crashes in 2018-19 and other safety problems.<br/><br/>Finally, we uncover the surprising 30-year history of a &quot;temporary&quot; menu feature in Microsoft Windows, created by engineer Raymond Chen in 1994, which has persisted through every version of the operating system up to Windows 11.
