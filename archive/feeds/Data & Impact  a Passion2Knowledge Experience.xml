			<description><![CDATA[What’s up P2K community?! Christian is FIRED UP for this episode! Trying out something new, Christian gives a proper run down on an incredibly interesting piece of pop culture nostalgia that originated in the 1980’s and still exists today! Get ready to delve into the history of the Garbage Pail Kids and how they took the market BY STORM in the 1980’s and beyond. Topps Company Inc.’s artists are truly SO entrepreneurial and world class and Christian is extremely passionate about this weird fad and niche audience of collectors. We hope you learn something new and gain value by understanding that people find ALL SORTS of things interesting and highly valuable. Our hope is that you gain some business value out of this as well. Find something you’re passionate about that is niche. Buy low and sell high, my friends! Although, Christian isn’t selling any of these cards. Far too much value from a childhood standpoint, but you get the idea! Feel the energy and have a great freakin’ weekend, ladies and gentlemen! Also, go check out GeePeeKay.com and related social media to get the full spectrum of what these unique cards have to offer! Thank you so much.]]></description>
