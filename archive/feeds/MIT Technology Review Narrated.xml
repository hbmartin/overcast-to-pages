      <title>AI search could break the web</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/31/1106504/ai-search-could-break-the-web/</link>
      <description>At its best, AI search can better infer a user’s intent, amplify quality content, and synthesize information from diverse sources. But if AI search becomes our primary portal to the web, it threatens to disrupt an already precarious digital economy. 
Today, the production of content online depends on a fragile set of incentives tied to virtual foot traffic: ads, subscriptions, donations, sales, or brand exposure. By shielding the web behind an all-knowing chatbot, AI search could deprive creators of the visits and “eyeballs” they need to survive.

      <title>Why AI could eat quantum computing’s lunch</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/07/1106730/why-ai-could-eat-quantum-computings-lunch/</link>
      <description>Tech companies have been funneling billions of dollars into quantum computers for years. The hope is that they’ll be a game changer for fields as diverse as finance, drug discovery, and logistics.
Those expectations have been especially high in physics and chemistry, where the weird effects of quantum mechanics come into play. In theory, this is where quantum computers could have a huge advantage over conventional machines.
But while the field struggles with the realities of tricky quantum hardware, another challenger is making headway in some of these most promising use cases. AI is now being applied to fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials science in a way that suggests quantum computing’s purported home turf might not be so safe after all.

      <title>Palmer Luckey on the Pentagon’s future of mixed reality</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/28/1106265/palmer-luckey-on-the-pentagons-future-of-mixed-reality/</link>
      <description>Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, has set his sights on a new mixed-reality headset customer: the Pentagon.

His company Anduril Industries, which focuses on drones, cruise missiles, and other AI-enhanced technologies for the US Department of Defense, announced it would partner with Microsoft on the US Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), arguably the military’s largest effort to develop a headset for use on the battlefield.

Anduril’s contribution to the project will be Lattice, an AI-powered system that connects everything from drones to radar jammers to surveil, detect objects, and aid in decision-making. It’s a tool that allows soldiers to receive instantaneous information not only from Anduril’s hardware, but also from radars, vehicles, sensors, and other equipment not made by Anduril. Now it will be built into the IVAS goggles. Luckey says the IVAS project is his top priority at Anduril.

If designed well, the device will automatically sort through countless pieces of information—drone locations, vehicles, intelligence—and flag the most important ones to the wearer in real time.

But that’s a big “if.” Though few would bet against Luckey’s expertise in the realm of mixed reality, few observers share his optimism for the IVAS program. They view it, thus far, as an avalanche of failures.

      <title>How covid conspiracy theories led to an alarming resurgence in AIDS denialism</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/07/1095762/covid-conspiracies-hiv-aids-denial-public-health/</link>
      <description>Podcaster Joe Rogan, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and football quarterback Aaron Rodgers are all helping revive AIDS denialism—a false collection of theories arguing either that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS or that there’s no such thing as HIV at all.  

These ideas were initially promoted back in the 1980s and ’90s by a cadre of scientists from unrelated fields, as well as many science-adjacent figures and self-proclaimed investigative journalists. But as more and more evidence stacked up against them, and as more people with HIV and AIDS started living longer lives thanks to effective new treatments, their claims largely fell out of favor. At least until the coronavirus arrived.

      <title>How to fine-tune AI for prosperity</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/20/1096733/how-to-fine-tune-ai-for-prosperity/</link>
      <description>The newest versions of generative AI are bedazzling, with lifelike videos, seemingly expert-sounding prose, and other all too humanlike behaviors. Business leaders are fretting over how to reinvent their companies as billions flow into startups, and the big AI companies are creating ever more powerful models. Predictions abound on how ChatGPT and the growing list of large language models will transform the way we work and organize our lives, providing instant advice on everything from financial investments to where to spend your next vacation and how to get there.

But for economists, the most critical question around our obsession with AI is how the fledgling technology will (or won’t) boost overall productivity, and if it does, how long it will take. Think of it as the bottom line to the AI hype machine: Can the technology lead to renewed prosperity after years of stagnant economic growth?

It could. But getting there will take some serious course corrections.

      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/12/1103833/ukraine-russia-drone-war-flash-radio-serhii-beskrestnov-social-media</link>
      <description>Despite it being over 100 years old, radio technology is still critical in almost all aspects of modern warfare—including in the drones that have come to dominate the Russia-Ukraine war. But before the war, there was a frightening vacuum of expertise. Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov, who has been obsessed with radios since childhood, stepped in to fill it. Now, the unlikely hero is sharing expert advice and intel on the ever-evolving technology that’s taken over the skies. His work may determine the future of Ukraine, and wars far beyond it.

      <description>You can practically hear the shrieks from corner offices around the world: “What is our ChatGPT play? How do we make money off this?”

Whether it’s based on hallucinatory beliefs or not, an AI gold rush has started to mine the anticipated business opportunities from generative AI models like ChatGPT.

But while companies and executives see a clear chance to cash in, the likely impact of the technology on workers and the economy on the whole is far less obvious.

      <title>The world’s on the verge of a carbon storage boom</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/12/1093477/the-worlds-on-the-verge-of-a-carbon-storage-boom/</link>
      <description>Pump jacks and pipelines clutter the Elk Hills oil field of California, a scrubby stretch of land in the southern Central Valley that rests above one of the nation’s richest deposits of fossil fuels.
Oil production has been steadily declining in the state for decades, as tech jobs have boomed and legislators have enacted rigorous environmental and climate rules. Companies, towns, and residents across Kern County, where the poverty rate hovers around 18%, have grown increasingly desperate for new economic opportunities.
In late 2023, one of the state’s largest oil and gas producers secured draft permits from the US Environmental Protection Agency to develop a new type of well in the oil field, which it asserts would provide just that. If the company gets final approval from regulators, it intends to drill a series of boreholes down to a sprawling sedimentary formation roughly 6,000 feet below the surface, where it will inject tens of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide to store it away forever.
Hundreds of similar projects are looming across the state, the US, and the world. Proponents hope it’s the start of a sort of oil boom in reverse, kick-starting a process through which the world will eventually bury more greenhouse gas than it adds to the atmosphere. But opponents insist these efforts will prolong the life of fossil-fuel plants, allow air and water pollution to continue, and create new health and environmental risks that could disproportionately harm disadvantaged communities surrounding the projects, including those near the Elk Hills oil field.

      <title>Is robotics about to have its own ChatGPT moment?</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/11/1090718/household-robots-ai-data-robotics/</link>
      <description>Robots that can do many of the things humans do in the home—folding laundry, cooking meals, cleaning—have been a dream of robotics research since the inception of the field in the 1950s. 

While engineers have made great progress in getting robots to work in tightly controlled environments like labs and factories, the home has proved difficult to design for. Out in the real, messy world, furniture and floor plans differ wildly; children and pets can jump in a robot’s way; and clothes that need folding come in different shapes, colors, and sizes. Managing such unpredictable settings and varied conditions has been beyond the capabilities of even the most advanced robot prototypes. 

But now, the field is at an inflection point. A new generation of researchers believes that generative AI could give robots the ability to learn new skills and adapt to new environments faster than ever before. This new approach, just maybe, can finally bring robots out of the factory and into the mainstream.

      <title>How gamification took over the world</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/13/1093375/gamification-behaviorism-npcs-video-games/</link>
      <description>We live in an undeniably gamified world. We stand up and move around to close colorful rings and earn achievement badges on our smartwatches; we meditate and sleep to recharge our body batteries; we plant virtual trees to be more productive; we chase “likes” and “karma” on social media sites and try to swipe our way toward social connection.

But instead of liberating us from drudgery and maximizing our potential, gamification has turned out to be just another tool for coercion, distraction, and control. Why did we fall for it?

      <description>The growing business of surf pools wants to bring the ocean experience inland, making surfing more accessible to communities far from the coasts.

These pools can use—and lose—millions upon millions of gallons of water every year. With many planned for areas facing water scarcity, who bears the cost of building the perfect wave?

      <title>How generative AI could reinvent what it means to play</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/20/1093428/generative-ai-reinventing-video-games-immersive-npcs/</link>
      <description>Open-world video games are inhabited by vast crowds of computer-controlled characters. These animated people—called NPCs, for “nonplayer characters”—populate the bars, city streets, or space ports of games. They make virtual worlds feel lived in and full. Often—but not always—you can talk to them.

After a while, however, the repetitive chitchat (or threats) of a passing stranger forces you to bump up against the truth: This is just a game. 

It may not always be like that. Just as it’s upending other industries, generative AI is opening the door to entirely new kinds of in-game interactions that are open-ended, creative, and unexpected. Future AI-powered NPCs that don’t rely on a script could make games—and other worlds—deeply immersive.

      <title>How a tiny Pacific Island became the global capital of cybercrime</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/02/1082798/tiny-pacific-island-global-capital-cybercrime/</link>
      <description>Tokelau is a group of three isolated atolls strung out across the Pacific Ocean between New Zealand (of which it’s an official territory) and Hawaii. Its population hovers around 1,400 people. Reaching it requires a boat ride from Samoa that can take over 24 hours. To say that Tokelau is remote is an understatement: it was the last place on Earth to be connected to the telephone… in 1997.

Despite its size, Tokelau has become an internet giant. Until recently, its .tk domain had more users than any other country’s: a staggering 25 million. Yet only one website with a .tk domain is actually from Tokelau. Nearly all the others are used by spammers, phishers, and cybercriminals.

This is the story of how Tokelau unwittingly became the global capital of cybercrime—and its fight to fix its reputation.

      <description>An AI startup created a hyperrealistic deepfake of MIT Technology Review’s senior AI reporter that was so believable, even she thought it was really her at first.

      <description>We've known of Europa’s existence for more than four centuries, but for most of that time, Jupiter’s fourth-largest moon was just a pinprick of light in our telescopes— a bright and curious companion to the solar system’s resident giant. Over the last few decades, however, as astronomers have scrutinized it through telescopes and six spacecraft have flown nearby, a new picture has come into focus. Europa is nothing like our moon.
Observations suggest that its heart is a ball of metal and rock, surrounded by a vast saltwater ocean that contains more than twice as much water as is found on Earth.
In the depths of its ocean, or perhaps crowded in subsurface lakes or below icy surface vents, Jupiter’s big, bright moon could host life.

      <title>How ASML took over the chipmaking chessboard</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/01/1090393/how-asml-took-over-the-chipmaking-chessboard/</link>
      <description>Moore’s Law holds that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years or so. In essence, it means that chipmakers are always trying to shrink the transistors on a microchip in order to pack more of them in. The cadence has been increasingly hard to maintain now that transistor dimensions measure in a few nanometers. In recent years ASML’s machines have kept Moore’s Law from sputtering out. Today, they are the only ones in the world capable of producing circuitry at the density needed to keep chipmakers roughly on track.
Martin Van den Brink is the outgoing co-president and CTO of ASML. He joined the Dutch company in 1984 when it was founded and has played a major role in guiding it to it current dominant position. He explains to MIT Technology Review how the company overtook its competition and how it can stay ahead.

      <title>Minds of machines: The great AI consciousness conundrum</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/16/1081149/ai-consciousness-conundrum/</link>
      <description>AI consciousness isn’t just a devilishly tricky intellectual puzzle; it’s a morally weighty problem with potentially dire consequences. Fail to identify a conscious AI, and you might unintentionally subjugate, or even torture, a being whose interests ought to matter. Mistake an unconscious AI for a conscious one, and you risk compromising human safety and happiness for the sake of an unthinking, unfeeling hunk of silicon and code.

Philosophers, cognitive scientists, and engineers are grappling with what it would take for AI to achieve consciousness—and whether it's even possible.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: That's a wrap!</title>
      <link>https://shiftshow.ai/ </link>
      <description>Three years ago this week we launched this podcast on a mission to show the world how AI touches our everyday lives. It's been our great honor and privilege to make it through three seasons, a global pandemic, an unbelievable nineteen (19!!) award nominations, and a whole lot of tests and demos.

Goodbyes are very hard to say, so instead we'll leave you with some of the show's highlights and an invitation to follow us as we continue our journey with a new show called SHIFT. Sign up for updates at shiftshow.ai and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.

Credits:
This series was created by Jennifer Strong and Emma Cillekens with the support of Gideon Lichfield and Michael Reilly. Its producers have been Emma Cillekens and Anthony Green. The editors have included Gideon Lichfield, Michael Reilly and Mat Honan with support from Karen Hao and Tate Ryan Mosley. You can thank Garret Lang and Jacob Gorski for the original music and excellent sound design. The weekly art was from Stephanie Arnett with album art from Eric Mongeon. 

Thanks for listening.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: When AI watches the streets </title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>The term ‘smart city’ paints a picture of a tech-enabled oasis—powered by sensors of all kinds. But we’re starting to recognize what all these tools might mean for privacy. In this episode, we meet a researcher studying how this is being applied in Iran and visit one of the nation’s top smart cities, to learn how its efforts there have evolved over time.

We Meet:
University of Oxford and Article19 Human Rights Researcher Mahsa Alimardani
City of Las Vegas Chief Innovation Officer Michael Sherwood
City of Hope Director of Campus Support Operations Mark Reed

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Concerning AI ethics</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>The best definitions of AI are vague, largely lack consensus and represent a huge challenge for lawmakers and legal scholars looking to regulate it. But back to back breakthroughs and rapid adoption of generative AI tools are making it feel a lot more real to everybody else. We examine how it’s possible that alone might be enough to push conversations about ethics further into focus.

We Meet:
MIT Technology Review Senior AI Reporter Melissa Heikkilä
Mozilla President Mark Surman
IBM Chief Privacy Officer Christina Montgomery
United Nations AI Advisor Neil Sahota

      <title>In Machines We Trust: The AI of the beholder</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Computers are ranking the way people look—and the results are influencing the things we do, the posts we see, and the way we think.
Ideas about what constitutes “beauty” are complex, subjective, and by no means limited to physical appearances. Elusive though it is, everyone wants more of it. That means big business and increasingly, people harnessing algorithms to create their ideal selves in the digital and, sometimes, physical worlds. In this episode, we explore the popularity of beauty filters, and sit down with someone who’s convinced his software will show you just how to nip and tuck your way to a better life.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: In the cockpit with AI </title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>How we train fighter pilots—both real and artificial—is undergoing a series of rapid changes. In order for these systems to be useful we need to trust them, but figuring out just how, when and why remains a massive challenge. In this second of a two-part series, we look at how AI is being used to teach human pilots to perform some of the most dangerous and difficult maneuvers in aerial combat, and we experience synthetic dogfighting first hand. 

We Meet:
Tom "T-Mac" Mackie, Director of Red6
Chris Cotting, Director Research, US Air Force Test Pilot School
Bill Gray, Chief Test Pilot, US Air Force Test Pilot School
Daniel Robinson, Founder &amp; CEO Red6

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Who watches AI watching students?</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>A boy wrote about his suicide attempt. He didn’t realize his school's software was watching.
While schools commonly use AI to sift through students' digital lives and flag keywords that may be considered concerning, critics ask at what cost to privacy.

We Meet:
Jeff Patterson, CEO of Gaggle
Mark Keierleber, investigative reporter at The 74
Teeth Logsdon-Wallace, student
Elizabeth Laird, director of Equity in Civic Technology at Center for Democracy &amp; Technology

Sounds From:
"Your Heart is a Muscle the Size of Your Fist" from the band Ramshackle Glory's 2011 album Live the Dream.
"Spying or protecting students? CBS46 Investigates school surveillance software" from CBS46 in Atlanta, GA on February 14, 2022.
"Student Surveillance Software: Schools know what your child is doing online. Do you?" from WSPA7 News in Greenville, SC on May 5, 2021.
"Spying or protecting students? CBS46 Investigates school surveillance software" from News 5 in Cleveland, OH on February 5, 2020.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: The AI in the newsroom</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>We asked ChatGPT to summarize this episode and this is what it wrote:
"In the episode, the host discussed the increasing use of AI language models like ChatGPT in newsrooms. The host explained that ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, is being used to automate tasks such as data analysis and writing, freeing up time for journalists to focus on more in-depth reporting. The host interviewed experts in the field who highlighted the benefits of using AI technology in newsrooms, including increased efficiency and consistency, as well as the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of reporting. However, the experts also discussed the challenges that come with using AI in journalism, such as issues around bias and accountability, and the need for human oversight to ensure ethical and accurate reporting. The episode concluded by exploring the future of AI in journalism, and how it will continue to shape the way news is produced and consumed."

      <title>In Machines We Trust: How pricing algorithms learn to collude (Update)</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Algorithms now determine how much things cost. It’s called dynamic pricing and it adjusts according to current market conditions in order to increase profits. The rise of ecommerce has propelled pricing algorithms into an everyday occurrence—whether you’re shopping on Amazon, booking a flight, hotel or ordering an Uber. 

We Meet: 

Lisa Wilkins, UX designer 

Gabe Smith, chief evangelist, Pricefx

Aylin Caliskan, assistant professor, University of Washington

Joseph Harrington, professor of business, economics and public policy, University of Pennsylvania

Maxime Cohen, Scale AI Chair professor, McGill University

      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>In the past, hiring decisions were made by people. Today, some key decisions that lead to whether someone gets a job or not are made by algorithms. The use of AI-based job interviews has increased since the pandemic. As demand increases, so too do questions about whether these algorithms make fair and unbiased hiring decisions, or find the most qualified applicant. In this second episode of a four-part series on AI in hiring, we meet some of the big players making this technology including the CEOs of HireVue and myInterview—and we test some of these tools ourselves.

      <description>The International Space Station hosts scores of experiments that can’t be done on Earth. But it’s also showing its age—with repairs and safety concerns becoming increasingly common as it draws nearer to its end of life. In this episode, we bring you a conversation with Astronaut Michael López-Alegría about the path forward for research in low Earth orbit, from MIT Technology Review’s flagship conference, EmTech MIT.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: AI finds its voice</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Synthetic voice technologies are increasingly passing as human. But today’s voice assistants are still a far cry from the hyper-intelligent thinking machines we’ve been musing about for decades. In this episode, we explore how machines learn to communicate—and what it means for the humans on the other end of the conversation.
In this encore edition we revisit an episode from last year.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: How retail is using AI to prevent fraud</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Retailers face an evolving landscape of fraud tactics each day. It’s why companies are increasingly turning to AI to try and catch threat patterns never seen before, and block attacks before they happen. While this approach lends itself to efficiency, it’s also one that relies on increasingly complex data profiles of consumers. In this episode, we peer into the world of retail fraud detection. 

We Meet:
David Cost, VP of ecommerce and marketing at Rainbow Apparel
Will Douglas Heaven, senior editor for AI at MIT Technology Review
Rajesh Ramanand, co-founder &amp; CEO at Signifyd

      <title>In Machines We Trust: When an algorithm gets it wrong (Encore)</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>The team that brings you In Machines We Trust has much to be grateful for—a brand new season of this show, a big awards nomination for The Extortion Economy, a show about ransomware that we made with ProPublica, and our new investigative series, Curious Coincidence. 

We celebrate how far we've come with a look back at where it all started!

--

What happens when an algorithm gets it wrong? In the first of a four-part series on face recognition, Jennifer Strong and the team at MIT Technology Review explore the arrest of a man who was falsely accused of a crime using facial recognition. The episode also starts to unpack the complexities of this technology and introduce some thorny questions about its use.  

We meet: 
Robert and Melissa Williams 
Peter Fussey, University of Essex
Hamid Khan, Stop LAPD Spying Coalition

Credits: This episode was reported and produced by Jennifer Strong, Tate Ryan-Mosley and Emma Cillekens. We had help from Karen Hao and Benji Rosen. We’re edited by Michael Reilly and Gideon Lichfield. Our technical director is Jacob Gorski. Special thanks to Kyle Thomas Hemingway and Eric Mongeon.</description>

      <itunes:subtitle>Part 1: The Problem</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>This week we're sharing another tech show we made that we think you're going to love. It's called The Extortion Economy and it's a five-part series about the ransomware epidemic produced with ProPublica.
See you soon with a whole new season of In Machines We Trust!!
--
A new-age iteration of the old-age extortion problem. A ransomware vigilante, a piracy (as in actual boats) expert, a school administrator, and a kidnapping victim share their experiences. This is part one.

We Meet:
Fabian Wosar, CTO, Emsisoft 
Doug Russell, Director of Technology, Haverhill Public Schools
Lisa Forte, Co-founder, Red Goat Cyber Security

Credits: 
This series is hosted by Meg Marco and produced by Emma Cillekens, Tate Ryan-Mosley and Anthony Green. It’s inspired by reporting from Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden from ProPublica. We're edited by Bobbie Johnson, Michael Reilly, Mat Honan and Robin Fields. Our mix engineer is Erick Gomez with help from Rebekah Wineman. Our theme music is by Jacob Gorski. Art is from Lisa Larson-Walker and Eric Mongeon. Emma Cillekens is our voice coach. The executive producers of The Extortion Economy podcast are Meg Marco and Jennifer Strong.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: The AI of the beholder (Encore)</title>
      <link>https://technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Computers are ranking the way people look—and the results are influencing the things we do, the posts we see, and the way we think.
Ideas about what constitutes “beauty” are complex, subjective, and by no means limited to physical appearances. Elusive though it is, everyone wants more of it. That means big business and increasingly, people harnessing algorithms to create their ideal selves in the digital and, sometimes, physical worlds. In this episode, we explore the popularity of beauty filters, and sit down with someone who’s convinced his software will show you just how to nip and tuck your way to a better life.

We meet: 
Shafee Hassan, Qoves Studio founder 
Lauren Rhue, Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the Robert H. Smith School of Business

      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Researchers have spent years trying to crack the mystery of how we express our feelings. Pioneers in the field of emotion detection will tell you the problem is far from solved. But that hasn’t stopped a growing number of companies from claiming their algorithms have cracked the puzzle. In part one of a two-part series on emotion AI, Jennifer Strong and the team at MIT Technology Review explore what emotion AI is, where it is, and what it means.

We meet: 

Rana El Kaliouby, Affectiva

Lisa Feldman Barrett, Northeastern University

Karen Hao, MIT Technology Review

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Attention shoppers, you’re being tracked (Update)</title>
      <link>https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Cameras in stores aren’t anything new—but these days there are AI brains behind the electric eyes. In some stores, sophisticated systems are tracking customers in almost every imaginable way, from recognizing their faces to gauging their age, their mood, and virtually gussying them up with makeup. The systems rarely ask for people’s permission, and for the most part they don’t have to. In our season 1 finale, we look at the explosion of AI and face recognition technologies in retail spaces, and what it means for the future of shopping.

We meet: 
RetailNext CTO Arun Nair,
L'Oreal's Technology Incubator Global VP Guive Balooch,
Modiface CEO Parham Aarabi
Biometrics pioneer and Chairman of ID4Africa Joseph Atick

      <link>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-machines-we-trust/id1523584878</link>
      <description>Voice technology is one of the biggest trends in the healthcare space. We look at how it might help care providers and patients, from a woman who is losing her speech, to documenting healthcare records for doctors. But how do you teach AI to learn to communicate more like a human, and will it lead to more efficient machines?

Kenneth Harper, VP &amp; GM, Healthcare Virtual Assistants and Ambient Clinical Intelligence at Nuance

Bob MacDonald, Technical Program Manager, Project Euphonia, Google 

Julie Cattiau, Project Manager, Project Euphonia, Google

      <description>Defining what is, or isn’t artificial intelligence can be tricky (or tough). So much so, even the experts get it wrong sometimes. That’s why MIT Technology Review’s Senior AI Editor Karen Hao created a flowchart to explain it all. In this bonus content our host and her team reimagined Hao’s reporting, gamifying it into a radio play.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: How pricing algorithms learn to collude </title>
      <link>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-machines-we-trust/id1523584878</link>
      <description>Algorithms now determine how much things cost. It’s called dynamic pricing and it adjusts according to current market conditions in order to increase profits. The rise of ecommerce has propelled pricing algorithms into an everyday occurrence—whether you’re shopping on Amazon, booking a flight, hotel or ordering an Uber. 

We Meet: 

Lisa Wilkins, UX designer 

Gabe Smith, chief evangelist, Pricefx

Aylin Caliskan, assistant professor, University of Washington

Joseph Harrington, professor of business, economics and public policy, University of Pennsylvania

Maxime Cohen, Scale AI Chair professor, McGill University

      <description>When it comes to hiring, it’s increasingly becoming an AI’s world, we’re just working in it. In this, the final episode of Season 2, and the conclusion of our series on AI and hiring, we take a look at how AI-based systems are increasingly playing gatekeeper in the hiring process—screening out applicants by the millions, based on little more than what they see in your resume. But we aren’t powerless against the machines. In fact, an increasing number of people and services are designed to help you play by—and in some cases bend—their rules to give you an edge.

Jamaal Eggleston, Work Readiness Instructor, The HOPE Program
Ian Siegel, CEO, ZipRecruiter
Sami Mäkeläinen, Head of Strategic Foresight, Telstra
Salil Pande, CEO, VMock
Gracy Sarkissian, Interim Executive Director, Wasserman Center for Career Development, New York University

      <link>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-machines-we-trust/id1523584878</link>
      <description>Increasingly, job seekers need to pass a series of ‘tests’ in the form of artificial intelligence games—just to be seen by a hiring manager. In this third, of a four-part miniseries on AI and hiring, we speak to someone who helped create these tests, we ask who might get left behind in the process and why there isn’t more policy in place. We also try out some of these tools ourselves.

We Meet:
Matthew Neale, Vice President of Assessment Products, Criteria Corp. 
Frida Polli, CEO, Pymetrics 
Henry Claypool, Consultant and former Obama Administration Member, Commission on Long-Term Care
Safe Hammad, CTO, Arctic Shores  
Alexandra Reeve Givens, President and CEO, Center for Democracy and Technology
Nathaniel Glasser, Employment Lawyer, Epstein Becker Green
Keith Sonderling, Commissioner, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

We Talked To: 
Aaron Rieke, Managing Director, Upturn
Adam Forman, Employment Lawyer, Epstein Becker Green
Brian Kropp, Vice President Research, Gartner
Josh Bersin, Research Analyst
Jonathan Kestenbaum, Co-Founder and Managing Director, Talent Tech Labs

      <description>If you’ve applied for a job lately, it’s all but guaranteed that your application was reviewed by software—in most cases, before a human ever laid eyes on it. In this episode, the first in a four-part investigation into automated hiring practices, we speak with the CEOs of ZipRecruiter and Career Builder, and one of the architects of LinkedIn’s algorithmic job-matching system, to explore how AI is increasingly playing matchmaker between job searchers and employers. But while software helps speed up the process of sifting through the job market, algorithms have a history of biasing the opportunities they present to people by gender, race...and in at least one case, whether you played lacrosse in high school.

      <description>Despite their popularity with kids, tablets and other connected devices are built on top of systems that weren’t designed for them to easily understand or navigate. Adapting algorithms to interact with a child isn’t without its complications—as no one child is exactly like another. Most recognition algorithms look for patterns and consistency to successfully identify objects. but kids are notoriously inconsistent. In this episode, we examine the relationship AI has with kids. 

We Meet:
Judith Danovitch, associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Louisville 
Lisa Anthony, associate professor of computer science at the University of Florida

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Land of a Billion Faces (Encore)</title>
      <link>https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Clearview AI has built one of the most comprehensive databases of people’s faces in the world. Your picture is probably in there (our host Jennifer Strong’s was). In the second of a four-part series on facial recognition, we meet the CEO of the controversial company who tells us our future is filled with face recognition—regardless of whether it's regulated or not.

We meet: 
Hoan Ton-That, Clearview AI 
Alexa Daniels-Shpall, Police Executive Research Forum

      <description>Credit scores have been used for decades to assess consumer creditworthiness, but their scope is far greater now that they are powered by algorithms: not only do they consider vastly more data, in both volume and type, but they increasingly affect whether you can buy a car, rent an apartment, or get a full-time job.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: AI finds its voice</title>
      <link>https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Synthetic voice technologies are increasingly passing as human. But today’s voice assistants are still a far cry from the hyper-intelligent thinking machines we’ve been musing about for decades. In this episode, we explore how machines learn to communicate—and what it means for the humans on the other end of the conversation.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: What’s AI doing in your wallet?</title>
      <link>https://technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Tech giants are moving into our wallets—bringing AI and big questions with them.
Our entire financial system is built on trust. We can exchange otherwise worthless paper bills for fresh groceries, or swipe a piece of plastic for new clothes. But this trust—typically in a central government-backed bank—is changing. As our financial lives are rapidly digitized, the resulting data turns into fodder for AI. Companies like Apple, Facebook and Google see it as an opportunity to disrupt the entire experience of how people think about and engage with their money. But will we as consumers really get more control over our finances? In this first of a series on automation and our wallets, we explore a digital revolution in how we pay for things.

We meet:
Umar Farooq, CEO of Onyx by J.P. Morgan Chase
Josh Woodward, Director of product management for Google Pay
Ed McLaughlin, President of operations and technology for MasterCard
Craig Vosburg, Chief product officer for MasterCard

      <title>In Machines We Trust: The AI of the beholder</title>
      <link>https://technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Computers are ranking the way people look—and the results are influencing the things we do, the posts we see, and the way we think.
Ideas about what constitutes “beauty” are complex, subjective, and by no means limited to physical appearances. Elusive though it is, everyone wants more of it. That means big business and increasingly, people harnessing algorithms to create their ideal selves in the digital and, sometimes, physical worlds. In this episode, we explore the popularity of beauty filters, and sit down with someone who’s convinced his software will show you just how to nip and tuck your way to a better life.

We meet: 
Shafee Hassan, Qoves Studio founder 
Lauren Rhue, Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the Robert H. Smith School of Business

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Attention Shoppers: You’re Being Tracked</title>
      <link>https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Cameras in stores aren’t anything new—but these days there are AI brains behind the electric eyes. In some stores, sophisticated systems are tracking customers in almost every imaginable way, from recognizing their faces to gauging their age, their mood, and virtually gussying them up with makeup. The systems rarely ask for people’s permission, and for the most part they don’t have to. In our season 1 finale, we look at the explosion of AI and face recognition technologies in retail spaces, and what it means for the future of shopping.

We meet: 
RetailNext CTO Arun Nair,
L'Oreal's Technology Incubator Global VP Guive Balooch,
Modiface CEO Parham Aarabi
Biometrics pioneer and Chairman of ID4Africa Joseph Atick

      <itunes:subtitle>Part-four of a series on unexpected uses of facial recognition.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Cameras in stores aren’t anything new—but these days there are AI brains behind the electric eyes. In some stores, sophisticated systems are tracking customers in almost every imaginable way, from recognizing their faces to gauging their age, their mood, and virtually gussying them up with makeup. The systems rarely ask for people’s permission, and for the most part they don’t have to. In our season 1 finale, we look at the explosion of AI and face recognition technologies in retail spaces, and what it means for the future of shopping.

We meet: 
RetailNext CTO Arun Nair,
L'Oreal's Technology Incubator Global VP Guive Balooch,
Modiface CEO Parham Aarabi
Biometrics pioneer and Chairman of ID4Africa Joseph Atick

      <title>In Machines We Trust: No Face... No Service</title>
      <link>https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Facial recognition technology is being deployed in housing projects, homeless shelters, schools, even across entire cities—usually without much fanfare or discussion. To some, this represents a critical technology for helping vulnerable communities gain access to social services. For others, it’s a flagrant invasion of privacy and human dignity. In this episode, we speak to the advocates, technologists, and dissidents dealing with the messy consequences that come when a technology that can identify you almost anywhere (even if you’re wearing a mask) is deployed without any clear playbook for regulating or managing it.

We meet: 
Eric Williams, senior staff attorney at Detroit Justice Center
Fabian Rogers, community advocate at Surveillance Technology Oversight Project
Helen Knight, founder of Tech for Social Good
Ray Bolling, president and co-founder of Eyemetric Identity Systems
Mary Sunden, executive director of the Christ Church Community Development Corporation

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Twitter's CTO on Misinformation (Live)</title>
      <link>https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>In the second of two exclusive interviews, Technology Review’s Editor-in-Chief Gideon Lichfield sat down with Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s Chief Technology officer to discuss the rise of misinformation on the social media platform. Agrawal discusses some of the measures the company has taken to fight back, while admitting Twitter is trying to thread a needle of mitigating harm caused by false content without becoming an arbiter of truth. This conversation is from the EmTech MIT virtual conference and has been edited for clarity.

      <itunes:summary>In the second of two exclusive interviews, Technology Review’s Editor-in-Chief Gideon Lichfield sat down with Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s Chief Technology officer to discuss the rise of misinformation on the social media platform. Agrawal discusses some of the measures the company has taken to fight back, while admitting Twitter is trying to thread a needle of mitigating harm caused by false content without becoming an arbiter of truth. This conversation is from the EmTech MIT virtual conference and has been edited for clarity.

      <title>In Machines We Trust: Facebook's CTO on Misinformation (Live)</title>
      <link>https://forms.technologyreview.com/in-machines-we-trust/</link>
      <description>Misinformation and social media have become inseparable from one another; as platforms like Twitter and Facebook have grown to globe-spanning size, so too has the threat posed by the spread of false content. In the midst of a volatile election season in the US and a raging global pandemic, the power of information to alter opinions and save lives (or endanger them) is on full display. In the first of two exclusive interviews with two of the tech world’s most powerful people, Technology Review’s Editor-in-Chief Gideon Lichfield sits down with Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer to talk about the challenges of combating false and harmful content on an online platform used by billions around the world. This conversation is from the EmTech MIT virtual conference and has been edited for length and clarity.

      <description>Defining what is, or isn’t artificial intelligence can be tricky (or tough). So much so, even the experts get it wrong sometimes. That’s why MIT Technology Review’s Senior AI Reporter Karen Hao created a flowchart to explain it all. In this bonus content our Host Jennifer Strong and her team reimagine Hao’s reporting, gamifying it into an audio postcard of sorts.

      <description>Researchers have spent years trying to crack the mystery of how we express our feelings. Pioneers in the field of emotion detection will tell you the problem is far from solved. But that hasn’t stopped a growing number of companies from claiming their algorithms have cracked the puzzle. In part one of a two-part series on emotion AI, Jennifer Strong and the team at MIT Technology Review explore what emotion AI is, where it is, and what it means.

Albert Fox Cahn, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project
Phil Mayor, ACLU Michigan
Captain Dori Koren, Las Vegas Police
