      <title>Building the Internet of Agents with Vijoy Pandey - #737</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/building-the-internet-of-agents/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Vijoy Pandey, SVP and general manager at Outshift by Cisco to discuss a foundational challenge for the enterprise: how do we make specialized agents from different vendors collaborate effectively? As companies like Salesforce, Workday, and Microsoft all develop their own agentic systems, integrating them creates a complex, probabilistic, and noisy environment, a stark contrast to the deterministic APIs of the past. Vijoy introduces Cisco's vision for an "Internet of Agents," a platform to manage this new reality, and its open-source implementation, AGNTCY. We explore the four phases of agent collaboration—discovery, composition, deployment, and evaluation—and dive deep into the communication stack, from syntactic protocols like A2A, ACP, and MCP to the deeper semantic challenges of creating a shared understanding between agents. Vijoy also unveils SLIM (Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging), a novel transport layer designed to make agent-to-agent communication quantum-safe, real-time, and efficient for multi-modal workloads.

      <title>LLMs for Equities Feature Forecasting at Two Sigma with Ben Wellington - #736</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/llms-for-equities-feature-forecasting-at-two-sigma/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Ben Wellington, deputy head of feature forecasting at Two Sigma. We dig into the team’s end-to-end approach to leveraging AI in equities feature forecasting, covering how they identify and create features, collect and quantify historical data, and build predictive models to forecast market behavior and asset prices for trading and investment. We explore the firm's platform-centric approach to managing an extensive portfolio of features and models, the impact of multimodal LLMs on accelerating the process of extracting novel features, the importance of strict data timestamping to prevent temporal leakage, and the way they consider build vs. buy decisions in a rapidly evolving landscape. Lastly, Ben also shares insights on leveraging open-source models and the future of agentic AI in quantitative finance.

      <title>Zero-Shot Auto-Labeling: The End of Annotation for Computer Vision with Jason Corso - #735</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/zero-shot-auto-labeling-the-end-of-annotation-for-computer-vision/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Jason Corso, co-founder of Voxel51 and professor at the University of Michigan, to explore automated labeling in computer vision. Jason introduces FiftyOne, an open-source platform for visualizing datasets, analyzing models, and improving data quality. We focus on Voxel51’s recent research report, “Zero-shot auto-labeling rivals human performance,” which demonstrates how zero-shot auto-labeling with foundation models can yield to significant cost and time savings compared to traditional human annotation. Jason explains how auto-labels, despite being "noisier" at lower confidence thresholds, can lead to better downstream model performance. We also cover Voxel51's "verified auto-labeling" approach, which utilizes a "stoplight" QA workflow (green, yellow, red light) to minimize human review. Finally, we discuss the challenges of handling decision boundary uncertainty and out-of-domain classes, the differences between synthetic data generation in vision and language domains, and the potential of agentic labeling.

      <title>Grokking, Generalization Collapse, and the Dynamics of Training Deep Neural Networks with Charles Martin - #734</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/grokking-generalization-collapse-and-the-dynamics-of-training-deep-neural-networks/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Charles Martin, founder of Calculation Consulting, to discuss Weight Watcher, an open-source tool for analyzing and improving Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based on principles from theoretical physics. We explore the foundations of the Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) theory that underpins it, which combines random matrix theory and renormalization group ideas to uncover deep insights about model training dynamics. Charles walks us through WeightWatcher’s ability to detect three distinct learning phases—underfitting, grokking, and generalization collapse—and how its signature “layer quality” metric reveals whether individual layers are underfit, overfit, or optimally tuned. Additionally, we dig into the complexities involved in fine-tuning models, the surprising correlation between model optimality and hallucination, the often-underestimated challenges of search relevance, and their implications for RAG. Finally, Charles shares his insights into real-world applications of generative AI and his lessons learned from working in the field.

      <title>RAG Risks: Why Retrieval-Augmented LLMs are Not Safer with Sebastian Gehrmann - #732</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/rag-risks-why-retrieval-augmented-llms-are-not-safer/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Sebastian Gehrmann, head of responsible AI in the Office of the CTO at Bloomberg, to discuss AI safety in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and generative AI in high-stakes domains like financial services. We explore how RAG, contrary to some expectations, can inadvertently degrade model safety. We cover examples of unsafe outputs that can emerge from these systems, different approaches to evaluating these safety risks, and the potential reasons behind this counterintuitive behavior. Shifting to the application of generative AI in financial services, Sebastian outlines a domain-specific safety taxonomy designed for the industry's unique needs. We also explore the critical role of governance and regulatory frameworks in addressing these concerns, the role of prompt engineering in bolstering safety, Bloomberg’s multi-layered mitigation strategies, and vital areas for further work in improving AI safety within specialized domains.

      <title>From Prompts to Policies: How RL Builds Better AI Agents with Mahesh Sathiamoorthy - #731</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/from-prompts-to-policies-how-rl-builds-better-ai-agents/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Mahesh Sathiamoorthy, co-founder and CEO of Bespoke Labs, to discuss how reinforcement learning (RL) is reshaping the way we build custom agents on top of foundation models. Mahesh highlights the crucial role of data curation, evaluation, and error analysis in model performance, and explains why RL offers a more robust alternative to prompting, and how it can improve multi-step tool use capabilities. We also explore the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for tool-augmented reasoning tasks, the reward-shaping strategies they’ve used, and Bespoke Labs’ open-source libraries like Curator. We also touch on the models MiniCheck for hallucination detection and MiniChart for chart-based QA.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/how-openai-builds-ai-agents-that-think-and-act/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Josh Tobin, member of technical staff at OpenAI, to discuss the company’s approach to building AI agents. We cover OpenAI's three agentic offerings—Deep Research for comprehensive web research, Operator for website navigation, and Codex CLI for local code execution. We explore OpenAI’s shift from simple LLM workflows to reasoning models specifically trained for multi-step tasks through reinforcement learning, and how that enables agents to more easily recover from failures while executing complex processes. Josh shares insights on the practical applications of these agents, including some unexpected use cases. We also discuss the future of human-AI collaboration in software development, such as with "vibe coding," the integration of tools through the Model Control Protocol (MCP), and the significance of context management in AI-enabled IDEs. Additionally, we highlight the challenges of ensuring trust and safety as AI agents become more powerful and autonomous.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ctibench-evaluating-llms-in-cyber-threat-intelligence/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Nidhi Rastogi, assistant professor at Rochester Institute of Technology to discuss Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), focusing on her recent project CTIBench—a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world CTI tasks. Nidhi explains the evolution of AI in cybersecurity, from rule-based systems to LLMs that accelerate analysis by providing critical context for threat detection and defense. We dig into the advantages and challenges of using LLMs in CTI, how techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are essential for keeping LLMs up-to-date with emerging threats, and how CTIBench measures LLMs’ ability to perform a set of real-world tasks of the cybersecurity analyst. We unpack the process of building the benchmark, the tasks it covers, and key findings from benchmarking various LLMs. Finally, Nidhi shares the importance of benchmarks in exposing model limitations and blind spots, the challenges of large-scale benchmarking, and the future directions of her AI4Sec Research Lab, including developing reliable mitigation techniques, monitoring "concept drift" in threat detection models, improving explainability in cybersecurity, and more.

      <title>Generative Benchmarking with Kelly Hong - #728</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/generative-benchmarking/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Kelly Hong, a researcher at Chroma, joins us to discuss "Generative Benchmarking," a novel approach to evaluating retrieval systems, like RAG applications, using synthetic data. Kelly explains how traditional benchmarks like MTEB fail to represent real-world query patterns and how embedding models that perform well on public benchmarks often underperform in production. The conversation explores the two-step process of Generative Benchmarking: filtering documents to focus on relevant content and generating queries that mimic actual user behavior. Kelly shares insights from applying this approach to Weights &amp; Biases' technical support bot, revealing how domain-specific evaluation provides more accurate assessments of embedding model performance. We also discuss the importance of aligning LLM judges with human preferences, the impact of chunking strategies on retrieval effectiveness, and how production queries differ from benchmark queries in ambiguity and style. Throughout the episode, Kelly emphasizes the need for systematic evaluation approaches that go beyond "vibe checks" to help developers build more effective RAG applications.

      <title>Exploring the Biology of LLMs with Circuit Tracing with Emmanuel Ameisen - #727</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/exploring-the-biology-of-llms-with-circuit-tracing/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Emmanuel Ameisen, a research engineer at Anthropic, returns to discuss two recent papers: "Circuit Tracing: Revealing Language Model Computational Graphs" and "On the Biology of a Large Language Model." Emmanuel explains how his team developed mechanistic interpretability methods to understand the internal workings of Claude by replacing dense neural network components with sparse, interpretable alternatives. The conversation explores several fascinating discoveries about large language models, including how they plan ahead when writing poetry (selecting the rhyming word "rabbit" before crafting the sentence leading to it), perform mathematical calculations using unique algorithms, and process concepts across multiple languages using shared neural representations. Emmanuel details how the team can intervene in model behavior by manipulating specific neural pathways, revealing how concepts are distributed throughout the network's MLPs and attention mechanisms. The discussion highlights both capabilities and limitations of LLMs, showing how hallucinations occur through separate recognition and recall circuits, and demonstrates why chain-of-thought explanations aren't always faithful representations of the model's actual reasoning. This research ultimately supports Anthropic's safety strategy by providing a deeper understanding of how these AI systems actually work.

      <title>Teaching LLMs to Self-Reflect with Reinforcement Learning with Maohao Shen - #726</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/teaching-llms-to-self-reflect-with-reinforcement-learning/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Maohao Shen, PhD student at MIT to discuss his paper, “Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search.” We dig into how Satori leverages reinforcement learning to improve language model reasoning—enabling model self-reflection, self-correction, and exploration of alternative solutions. We explore the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) approach, which uses special tokens—continue, reflect, and explore—to guide the model through distinct reasoning actions, allowing it to navigate complex reasoning tasks without external supervision. We also break down Satori’s two-stage training process: format tuning, which teaches the model to understand and utilize the special action tokens, and reinforcement learning, which optimizes reasoning through trial-and-error self-improvement. We cover key techniques such “restart and explore,” which allows the model to self-correct and generalize beyond its training domain. Finally, Maohao reviews Satori’s performance and how it compares to other models, the reward design, the benchmarks used, and the surprising observations made during the research.

      <itunes:summary>Today, we're joined by Maohao Shen, PhD student at MIT to discuss his paper, “Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search.” We dig into how Satori leverages reinforcement learning to improve language model reasoning—enabling model self-reflection, self-correction, and exploration of alternative solutions. We explore the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) approach, which uses special tokens—continue, reflect, and explore—to guide the model through distinct reasoning actions, allowing it to navigate complex reasoning tasks without external supervision. We also break down Satori’s two-stage training process: format tuning, which teaches the model to understand and utilize the special action tokens, and reinforcement learning, which optimizes reasoning through trial-and-error self-improvement. We cover key techniques such “restart and explore,” which allows the model to self-correct and generalize beyond its training domain. Finally, Maohao reviews Satori’s performance and how it compares to other models, the reward design, the benchmarks used, and the surprising observations made during the research.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/dynamic-token-merging-for-efficient-byte-level-language-models/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Julie Kallini, PhD student at Stanford University to discuss her recent papers, “MrT5: Dynamic Token Merging for Efficient Byte-level Language Models” and “Mission: Impossible Language Models.” For the MrT5 paper, we explore the importance and failings of tokenization in large language models—including inefficient compression rates for under-resourced languages—and dig into byte-level modeling as an alternative. We discuss the architecture of MrT5, its ability to learn language-specific compression rates, its performance on multilingual benchmarks and character-level manipulation tasks, and its performance and efficiency. For the “Mission: Impossible Language Models” paper, we review the core idea behind the research, the definition and creation of impossible languages, the creation of impossible language training datasets, and explore the bias of language model architectures towards natural language.

      <title>Scaling Up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning with Jonas Geiping - #723</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/scaling-up-test-time-compute-with-latent-reasoning/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Jonas Geiping, research group leader at Ellis Institute and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems to discuss his recent paper, “Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.” This paper proposes a novel language model architecture which uses recurrent depth to enable “thinking in latent space.” We dig into “internal reasoning” versus “verbalized reasoning”—analogous to non-verbalized and verbalized thinking in humans, and discuss how the model searches in latent space to predict the next token and dynamically allocates more compute based on token difficulty. We also explore how the recurrent depth architecture simplifies LLMs, the parallels to diffusion models, the model's performance on reasoning tasks, the challenges of comparing models with varying compute budgets, and architectural advantages such as zero-shot adaptive exits and natural speculative decoding.

      <description>Today, we're joined by Chengzu Li, PhD student at the University of Cambridge to discuss his recent paper, “Imagine while Reasoning in Space: Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought.” We explore the motivations behind MVoT, its connection to prior work like TopViewRS, and its relation to cognitive science principles such as dual coding theory. We dig into the MVoT framework along with its various task environments—maze, mini-behavior, and frozen lake. We explore token discrepancy loss, a technique designed to align language and visual embeddings, ensuring accurate and meaningful visual representations. Additionally, we cover the data collection and training process, reasoning over relative spatial relations between different entities, and dynamic spatial reasoning. Lastly, Chengzu shares insights from experiments with MVoT, focusing on the lessons learned and the potential for applying these models in real-world scenarios like robotics and architectural design.

      <description>Today, we're joined by Niklas Muennighoff, a PhD student at Stanford University, to discuss his paper, “S1: Simple Test-Time Scaling.” We explore the motivations behind S1, as well as how it compares to OpenAI's O1 and DeepSeek's R1 models. We dig into the different approaches to test-time scaling, including parallel and sequential scaling, as well as S1’s data curation process, its training recipe, and its use of model distillation from Google Gemini and DeepSeek R1. We explore the novel "budget forcing" technique developed in the paper, allowing it to think longer for harder problems and optimize test-time compute for better performance. Additionally, we cover the evaluation benchmarks used, the comparison between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and similar projects like the Hugging Face Open R1 project. Finally, we discuss the open-sourcing of S1 and its future directions.

      <description>Today, we're joined by Ron Diamant, chief architect for Trainium at Amazon Web Services, to discuss hardware acceleration for generative AI and the design and role of the recently released Trainium2 chip. We explore the architectural differences between Trainium and GPUs, highlighting its systolic array-based compute design, and how it balances performance across key dimensions like compute, memory bandwidth, memory capacity, and network bandwidth. We also discuss the Trainium tooling ecosystem including the Neuron SDK, Neuron Compiler, and Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI). We also dig into the various ways Trainum2 is offered, including Trn2 instances, UltraServers, and UltraClusters, and access through managed services like AWS Bedrock. Finally, we cover sparsity optimizations, customer adoption, performance benchmarks, support for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and what’s next for Trainium.

      <title>π0: A Foundation Model for Robotics with Sergey Levine - #719</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/%cf%800-a-foundation-model-for-robotics/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Sergey Levine, associate professor at UC Berkeley and co-founder of Physical Intelligence, to discuss π0 (pi-zero), a general-purpose robotic foundation model. We dig into the model architecture, which pairs a vision language model (VLM) with a diffusion-based action expert, and the model training "recipe," emphasizing the roles of pre-training and post-training with a diverse mixture of real-world data to ensure robust and intelligent robot learning. We review the data collection approach, which uses human operators and teleoperation rigs, the potential of synthetic data and reinforcement learning in enhancing robotic capabilities, and much more. We also introduce the team’s new FAST tokenizer, which opens the door to a fully Transformer-based model and significant improvements in learning and generalization. Finally, we cover the open-sourcing of π0 and future directions for their research.

      <title>Automated Reasoning to Prevent LLM Hallucination with Byron Cook - #712</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/automated-reasoning-to-prevent-llm-hallucination/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Byron Cook, VP and distinguished scientist in the Automated Reasoning Group at AWS to dig into the underlying technology behind the newly announced Automated Reasoning Checks feature of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. Automated Reasoning Checks uses mathematical proofs to help LLM users safeguard against hallucinations. We explore recent advancements in the field of automated reasoning, as well as some of the ways it is applied broadly, as well as across AWS, where it is used to enhance security, cryptography, virtualization, and more. We discuss how the new feature helps users to generate, refine, validate, and formalize policies, and how those policies can be deployed alongside LLM applications to ensure the accuracy of generated text. Finally, Byron also shares the benchmarks they’ve applied, the use of techniques like ‘constrained coding’ and ‘backtracking,’ and the future co-evolution of automated reasoning and generative AI.

      <title>An Agentic Mixture of Experts for DevOps with Sunil Mallya - #708</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/an-agentic-mixture-of-experts-for-devops/</link>
      <description>Today we're joined by Sunil Mallya, CTO and co-founder of Flip AI. We discuss Flip’s incident debugging system for DevOps, which was built using a custom mixture of experts (MoE) large language model (LLM) trained on a novel "CoMELT" observability dataset which combines traditional MELT data—metrics, events, logs, and traces—with code to efficiently identify root failure causes in complex software systems. We discuss the challenges of integrating time-series data with LLMs and their multi-decoder architecture designed for this purpose. Sunil describes their system's agent-based design, focusing on clear roles and boundaries to ensure reliability. We examine their "chaos gym," a reinforcement learning environment used for testing and improving the system's robustness. Finally, we discuss the practical considerations of deploying such a system at scale in diverse environments and much more.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ml-models-for-safety-critical-systems/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Lucas García, principal product manager for deep learning at MathWorks to discuss incorporating ML models into safety-critical systems. We begin by exploring the critical role of verification and validation (V&amp;V) in these applications. We review the popular V-model for engineering critical systems and then dig into the “W” adaptation that’s been proposed for incorporating ML models. Next, we discuss the complexities of applying deep learning neural networks in safety-critical applications using the aviation industry as an example, and talk through the importance of factors such as data quality, model stability, robustness, interpretability, and accuracy. We also explore formal verification methods, abstract transformer layers, transformer-based architectures, and the application of various software testing techniques. Lucas also introduces the field of constrained deep learning and convex neural networks and its benefits and trade-offs.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ai-agents-substance-or-snake-oil/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Arvind Narayanan, professor of Computer Science at Princeton University to discuss his recent works, AI Agents That Matter and AI Snake Oil. In “AI Agents That Matter”, we explore the range of agentic behaviors, the challenges in benchmarking agents, and the ‘capability and reliability gap’, which creates risks when deploying AI agents in real-world applications. We also discuss the importance of verifiers as a technique for safeguarding agent behavior. We then dig into the AI Snake Oil book, which uncovers examples of problematic and overhyped claims in AI. Arvind shares various use cases of failed applications of AI, outlines a taxonomy of AI risks, and shares his insights on AI’s catastrophic risks. Additionally, we also touched on different approaches to LLM-based reasoning, his views on tech policy and regulation, and his work on CORE-Bench, a benchmark designed to measure AI agents' accuracy in computational reproducibility tasks.

      <description>Today, we're joined by Simon Willison, independent researcher and creator of Datasette to discuss the many ways software developers and engineers can take advantage of large language models (LLMs) to boost their productivity. We dig into Simon’s own workflows and how he uses popular models like ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude to write and test hundreds of lines of code while out walking his dog. We review Simon’s favorite prompting and debugging techniques, his strategies for sidestepping the limitations of contemporary models, how he uses Claude’s Artifacts feature for rapid prototyping, his thoughts on the use and impact of vision models, the role he sees for open source models and local LLMs, and much more.

      <title>Automated Design of Agentic Systems with Shengran Hu - #700</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/automated-design-of-agentic-systems/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Shengran Hu, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia, to discuss Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), an approach focused on automatically creating agentic system designs. We explore the spectrum of agentic behaviors, the motivation for learning all aspects of agentic system design, the key components of the ADAS approach, and how it uses LLMs to design novel agent architectures in code. We also cover the iterative process of ADAS, its potential to shed light on the behavior of foundation models, the higher-level meta-behaviors that emerge in agentic systems, and how ADAS uncovers novel design patterns through emergent behaviors, particularly in complex tasks like the ARC challenge. Finally, we touch on the practical applications of ADAS and its potential use in system optimization for real-world tasks.

      <title>Genie: Generative Interactive Environments with Ashley Edwards - #696</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/genie-generative-interactive-environments/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Ashley Edwards, a member of technical staff at Runway, to discuss Genie: Generative Interactive Environments, a system for creating ‘playable’ video environments for training deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents at scale in a completely unsupervised manner. We explore the motivations behind Genie, the challenges of data acquisition for RL, and Genie’s capability to learn world models from videos without explicit action data, enabling seamless interaction and frame prediction. Ashley walks us through Genie’s core components—the latent action model, video tokenizer, and dynamics model—and explains how these elements collaborate to predict future frames in video sequences. We discuss the model architecture, training strategies, benchmarks used, as well as the application of spatiotemporal transformers and the MaskGIT techniques used for efficient token prediction and representation. Finally, we touched on Genie’s practical implications, its comparison to other video generation models like “Sora,” and potential future directions in video generation and diffusion models.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/bridging-the-sim2real-gap-in-robotics/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Marius Memmel, a PhD student at the University of Washington, to discuss his research on sim-to-real transfer approaches for developing autonomous robotic agents in unstructured environments. Our conversation focuses on his recent ASID and URDFormer papers. We explore the complexities presented by real-world settings like a cluttered kitchen, data acquisition challenges for training robust models, the importance of simulation, and the challenge of bridging the sim2real gap in robotics. Marius introduces ASID, a framework designed to enable robots to autonomously generate and refine simulation models to improve sim-to-real transfer. We discuss the role of Fisher information as a metric for trajectory sensitivity to physical parameters and the importance of exploration and exploitation phases in robot learning. Additionally, we cover URDFormer, a transformer-based model that generates URDF documents for scene and object reconstruction to create realistic simulation environments.

      <title>Building Real-World LLM Products with Fine-Tuning and More with Hamel Husain - #694</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/building-real-world-llm-products-with-fine-tuning-and-more/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Hamel Husain, founder of Parlance Labs, to discuss the ins and outs of building real-world products using large language models (LLMs). We kick things off discussing novel applications of LLMs and how to think about modern AI user experiences. We then dig into the key challenge faced by LLM developers—how to iterate from a snazzy demo or proof-of-concept to a working LLM-based application. We discuss the pros, cons, and role of fine-tuning LLMs and dig into when to use this technique. We cover the fine-tuning process, common pitfalls in evaluation—such as relying too heavily on generic tools and missing the nuances of specific use cases, open-source LLM fine-tuning tools like Axolotl, the use of LoRA adapters, and more. Hamel also shares insights on model optimization and inference frameworks and how developers should approach these tools. Finally, we dig into how to use systematic evaluation techniques to guide the improvement of your LLM application, the importance of data generation and curation, and the parallels to traditional software engineering practices.

      <title>Decoding Animal Behavior to Train Robots with EgoPet with Amir Bar - #692</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/decoding-animal-behavior-to-train-robots-with-egopet/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Amir Bar, a PhD candidate at Tel Aviv University and UC Berkeley to discuss his research on visual-based learning, including his recent paper, “EgoPet: Egomotion and Interaction Data from an Animal’s Perspective.” Amir shares his research projects focused on self-supervised object detection and analogy reasoning for general computer vision tasks. We also discuss the current limitations of caption-based datasets in model training, the ‘learning problem’ in robotics, and the gap between the capabilities of animals and AI systems. Amir introduces ‘EgoPet,’ a dataset and benchmark tasks which allow motion and interaction data from an animal's perspective to be incorporated into machine learning models for robotic planning and proprioception. We explore the dataset collection process, comparisons with existing datasets and benchmark tasks, the findings on the model performance trained on EgoPet, and the potential of directly training robot policies that mimic animal behavior.

      <title>Long Context Language Models and their Biological Applications with Eric Nguyen - #690</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/long-context-language-models-and-their-biological-applications/</link>
      <description>Today, we're joined by Eric Nguyen, PhD student at Stanford University. In our conversation, we explore his research on long context foundation models and their application to biology particularly Hyena, and its evolution into Hyena DNA and Evo models. We discuss Hyena, a convolutional-based language model developed to tackle the challenges posed by long context lengths in language modeling. We dig into the limitations of transformers in dealing with longer sequences, the motivation for using convolutional models over transformers, its model training and architecture, the role of FFT in computational optimizations, and model explainability in long-sequence convolutions. We also talked about Hyena DNA, a genomic foundation model pre-trained on 1 million tokens, designed to capture long-range dependencies in DNA sequences. Finally, Eric introduces Evo, a 7 billion parameter hybrid model integrating attention layers with Hyena DNA's convolutional framework. We cover generating and designing DNA with language models, hallucinations in DNA models, evaluation benchmarks, the trade-offs between state-of-the-art models, zero-shot versus a few-shot performance, and the exciting potential in areas like CRISPR-Cas gene editing.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/gen-ai-at-the-edge-qualcomm-ai-research-at-cvpr-2024/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Fatih Porikli, senior director of technology at Qualcomm AI Research. In our conversation, we covered several of the Qualcomm team’s 16 accepted main track and workshop papers at this year’s CVPR conference. The papers span a variety of generative AI and traditional computer vision topics, with an emphasis on increased training and inference efficiency for mobile and edge deployment. We explore efficient diffusion models for text-to-image generation, grounded reasoning in videos using language models, real-time on-device 360° image generation for video portrait relighting, unique video-language model for situated interactions like fitness coaching, and visual reasoning model and benchmark for interpreting complex mathematical plots, and more! We also touched on several of the demos the team will be presenting at the conference, including multi-modal vision-language models (LLaVA) and parameter-efficient fine tuning (LoRA) on mobile phones.

      <title>GraphRAG: Knowledge Graphs for AI Applications with Kirk Marple - #681</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/graphrag-knowledge-graphs-for-ai-applications/</link>
      <description>Today we're joined by Kirk Marple, CEO and founder of Graphlit, to explore the emerging paradigm of "GraphRAG," or Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation. In our conversation, Kirk digs into the GraphRAG architecture and how Graphlit uses it to offer a multi-stage workflow for ingesting, processing, retrieving, and generating content using LLMs (like GPT-4) and other Generative AI tech. He shares how the system performs entity extraction to build a knowledge graph and how graph, vector, and object storage are integrated in the system. We dive into how the system uses “prompt compilation” to improve the results it gets from Large Language Models during generation. We conclude by discussing several use cases the approach supports, as well as future agent-based applications it enables.

      <title>Localizing and Editing Knowledge in LLMs with Peter Hase - #679</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/localizing-and-editing-knowledge-in-llms/</link>
      <description>Today we're joined by Peter Hase, a fifth-year PhD student at the University of North Carolina NLP lab. We discuss "scalable oversight", and the importance of developing a deeper understanding of how large neural networks make decisions. We learn how matrices are probed by interpretability researchers, and explore the two schools of thought regarding how LLMs store knowledge. Finally, we discuss the importance of deleting sensitive information from model weights, and how "easy-to-hard generalization" could increase the risk of releasing open-source foundation models.

      <title>V-JEPA, AI Reasoning from a Non-Generative Architecture with Mido Assran - #677</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/v-jepa-ai-reasoning-from-a-non-generative-architecture/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Mido Assran, a research scientist at Meta’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR). In this conversation, we discuss V-JEPA, a new model being billed as “the next step in Yann LeCun's vision” for true artificial reasoning. V-JEPA, the video version of Meta’s Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, aims to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence by training models to learn abstract concepts in a more efficient predictive manner than generative models. V-JEPA uses a novel self-supervised training approach that allows it to learn from unlabeled video data without being distracted by pixel-level detail. Mido walks us through the process of developing the architecture and explains why it has the potential to revolutionize AI.

      <title>Video as a Universal Interface for AI Reasoning with Sherry Yang - #676</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/video-as-a-universal-interface-for-ai-reasoning/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sherry Yang, senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and a PhD student at UC Berkeley. In this interview, we discuss her new paper, "Video as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making,” which explores how generative video models can play a role similar to language models as a way to solve tasks in the real world. Sherry draws the analogy between natural language as a unified representation of information and text prediction as a common task interface and demonstrates how video as a medium and generative video as a task exhibit similar properties. This formulation enables video generation models to play a variety of real-world roles as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators. Finally, we explore UniSim, an interactive demo of Sherry's work and a preview of her vision for interacting with AI-generated environments.

      <title>Assessing the Risks of Open AI Models with Sayash Kapoor - #675</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/assessing-the-risks-of-open-ai-models/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sayash Kapoor, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. Sayash walks us through his paper: "On the Societal Impact of Open Foundation Models.” We dig into the controversy around AI safety, the risks and benefits of releasing open model weights, and how we can establish common ground for assessing the threats posed by AI. We discuss the application of the framework presented in the paper to specific risks, such as the biosecurity risk of open LLMs, as well as the growing problem of "Non Consensual Intimate Imagery" using open diffusion models.

      <title>OLMo: Everything You Need to Train an Open Source LLM with Akshita Bhagia - #674</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/olmo-everything-you-need-to-train-an-open-source-llm/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Akshita Bhagia, a senior research engineer at the Allen Institute for AI. Akshita joins us to discuss OLMo, a new open source language model with 7 billion and 1 billion variants, but with a key difference compared to similar models offered by Meta, Mistral, and others. Namely, the fact that AI2 has also published the dataset and key tools used to train the model. In our chat with Akshita, we dig into the OLMo models and the various projects falling under the OLMo umbrella, including Dolma, an open three-trillion-token corpus for language model pretraining, and Paloma, a benchmark and tooling for evaluating language model performance across a variety of domains.

      <title>Training Data Locality and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs with Ben Prystawski - #673</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/training-data-locality-and-chain-of-thought-reasoning-in-llms/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Ben Prystawski, a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University working at the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning. Our conversation centers on Ben’s recent paper, “Why think step by step? Reasoning emerges from the locality of experience,” which he recently presented at NeurIPS 2023. In this conversation, we start out exploring basic questions about LLM reasoning, including whether it exists, how we can define it, and how techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning appear to strengthen it. We then dig into the details of Ben’s paper, which aims to understand why thinking step-by-step is effective and demonstrates that local structure is the key property of LLM training data that enables it.

      <title>Reasoning Over Complex Documents with DocLLM with Armineh Nourbakhsh - #672</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/reasoning-over-complex-documents-with-docllm/</link>
      <description>Today we're joined by Armineh Nourbakhsh of JP Morgan AI Research to discuss the development and capabilities of DocLLM, a layout-aware large language model for multimodal document understanding. Armineh provides a historical overview of the challenges of document AI and an introduction to the DocLLM model. Armineh explains how this model, distinct from both traditional LLMs and document AI models, incorporates both textual semantics and spatial layout in processing enterprise documents like reports and complex contracts. We dig into her team’s approach to training DocLLM, their choice of a generative model as opposed to an encoder-based approach, the datasets they used to build the model, their approach to incorporating layout information, and the various ways they evaluated the model’s performance.

      <title>Are Emergent Behaviors in LLMs an Illusion? with Sanmi Koyejo - #671</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/are-emergent-behaviors-in-llms-an-illusion-2/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sanmi Koyejo, assistant professor at Stanford University, to continue our NeurIPS 2024 series. In our conversation, Sanmi discusses his two recent award-winning papers. First, we dive into his paper, “Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?”. We discuss the different ways LLMs are evaluated and the excitement surrounding their“emergent abilities” such as the ability to perform arithmetic Sanmi describes how evaluating model performance using nonlinear metrics can lead to the illusion that the model is rapidly gaining new capabilities, whereas linear metrics show smooth improvement as expected, casting doubt on the significance of emergence. We continue on to his next paper, “DecodingTrust: A Comprehensive Assessment of Trustworthiness in GPT Models,” discussing the methodology it describes for evaluating concerns such as the toxicity, privacy, fairness, and robustness of LLMs.

      <title>AI Trends 2024: Reinforcement Learning in the Age of LLMs with Kamyar Azizzadenesheli - #670</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ai-trends-2024-reinforcement-learning-in-the-age-of-llms/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, a staff researcher at Nvidia, to continue our AI Trends 2024 series. In our conversation, Kamyar updates us on the latest developments in reinforcement learning (RL), and how the RL community is taking advantage of the abstract reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Kamyar shares his insights on how LLMs are pushing RL performance forward in a variety of applications, such as ALOHA, a robot that can learn to fold clothes, and Voyager, an RL agent that uses GPT-4 to outperform prior systems at playing Minecraft. We also explore the progress being made in assessing and addressing the risks of RL-based decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and agriculture. Finally, we discuss the future of deep reinforcement learning, Kamyar’s top predictions for the field, and how greater compute capabilities will be critical in achieving general intelligence.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/building-and-deploying-real-world-rag-applications/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Ram Sriharsha, VP of engineering at Pinecone. In our conversation, we dive into the topic of vector databases and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We explore the trade-offs between relying solely on LLMs for retrieval tasks versus combining retrieval in vector databases and LLMs, the advantages and complexities of RAG with vector databases, the key considerations for building and deploying real-world RAG-based applications, and an in-depth look at Pinecone's new serverless offering. Currently in public preview, Pinecone Serverless is a vector database that enables on-demand data loading, flexible scaling, and cost-effective query processing. Ram discusses how the serverless paradigm impacts the vector database’s core architecture, key features, and other considerations. Lastly, Ram shares his perspective on the future of vector databases in helping enterprises deliver RAG systems.

      <title>Nightshade: Data Poisoning to Fight Generative AI with Ben Zhao - #668</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/nightshade-data-poisoning-to-fight-generative-ai/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Ben Zhao, a Neubauer professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. In our conversation, we explore his research at the intersection of security and generative AI. We focus on Ben’s recent Fawkes, Glaze, and Nightshade projects, which use “poisoning” approaches to provide users with security and protection against AI encroachments. The first tool we discuss, Fawkes, imperceptibly “cloaks” images in such a way that models perceive them as highly distorted, effectively shielding individuals from recognition by facial recognition models. We then dig into Glaze, a tool that employs machine learning algorithms to compute subtle alterations that are indiscernible to human eyes but adept at tricking the models into perceiving a significant shift in art style, giving artists a unique defense against style mimicry. Lastly, we cover Nightshade, a strategic defense tool for artists akin to a 'poison pill' which allows artists to apply imperceptible changes to their images that effectively “breaks” generative AI models that are trained on them.

In our conversation, we explore his research at the intersection of security and generative AI. We focus on Ben’s recent Fawkes, Glaze, and Nightshade projects, which use “poisoning” approaches to provide users with security and protection against AI encroachments. The first tool we discuss, Fawkes, imperceptibly “cloaks” images in such a way that models perceive them as highly distorted, effectively shielding individuals from recognition by facial recognition models. We then dig into Glaze, a tool that employs machine learning algorithms to compute subtle alterations that are indiscernible to human eyes but adept at tricking the models into perceiving a significant shift in art style, giving artists a unique defense against style mimicry. Lastly, we cover Nightshade, a strategic defense tool for artists akin to a 'poison pill' which allows artists to apply imperceptible changes to their images that effectively “breaks” generative AI models that are trained on them.

      <title>Learning Transformer Programs with Dan Friedman - #667</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/learning-transformer-programs/</link>
      <description>Today, we continue our NeurIPS series with Dan Friedman, a PhD student in the Princeton NLP group. In our conversation, we explore his research on mechanistic interpretability for transformer models, specifically his paper, Learning Transformer Programs. The LTP paper proposes modifications to the transformer architecture which allow transformer models to be easily converted into human-readable programs, making them inherently interpretable. In our conversation, we compare the approach proposed by this research with prior approaches to understanding the models and their shortcomings. We also dig into the approach’s function and scale limitations and constraints.

      <title>Quantizing Transformers by Helping Attention Heads Do Nothing with Markus Nagel - #663</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/quantizing-transformers-by-helping-attention-heads-do-nothing/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Markus Nagel, research scientist at Qualcomm AI Research, who helps us kick off our coverage of NeurIPS 2023. In our conversation with Markus, we cover his accepted papers at the conference, along with other work presented by Qualcomm AI Research scientists. Markus’ first paper, Quantizable Transformers: Removing Outliers by Helping Attention Heads Do Nothing, focuses on tackling activation quantization issues introduced by the attention mechanism and how to solve them. We also discuss Pruning vs Quantization: Which is Better?, which focuses on comparing the effectiveness of these two methods in achieving model weight compression. Additional papers discussed focus on topics like using scalarization in multitask and multidomain learning to improve training and inference, using diffusion models for a sequence of state models and actions, applying geometric algebra with equivariance to transformers, and applying a deductive verification of chain of thought reasoning performed by LLMs.

      <title>Patterns and Middleware for LLM Applications with Kyle Roche - #659</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/patterns-and-middleware-for-llm-applications/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Kyle Roche, founder and CEO of Griptape to discuss patterns and middleware for LLM applications. We dive into the emerging patterns for developing LLM applications, such as off prompt data—which allows data retrieval without compromising the chain of thought within language models—and pipelines, which are sequential tasks that are given to LLMs that can involve different models for each task or step in the pipeline. We also explore Griptape, an open-source, Python-based middleware stack that aims to securely connect LLM applications to an organization’s internal and external data systems. We discuss the abstractions it offers, including drivers, memory management, rule sets, DAG-based workflows, and a prompt stack. Additionally, we touch on common customer concerns such as privacy, retraining, and sovereignty issues, and several use cases that leverage role-based retrieval methods to optimize human augmentation tasks.

      <title>Delivering AI Systems in Highly Regulated Environments with Miriam Friedel - #653</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/delivering-ai-systems-in-highly-regulated-environments/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Miriam Friedel, senior director of ML engineering at Capital One. In our conversation with Miriam, we discuss some of the challenges faced when delivering machine learning tools and systems in highly regulated enterprise environments, and some of the practices her teams have adopted to help them operate with greater speed and agility. We also explore how to create a culture of collaboration, the value of standardized tooling and processes, leveraging open-source, and incentivizing model reuse. Miriam also shares her thoughts on building a ‘unicorn’ team, and what this means for the team she’s built at Capital One, as well as her take on build vs. buy decisions for MLOps, and the future of MLOps and enterprise AI more broadly. Throughout, Miriam shares examples of these ideas at work in some of the tools their team has built, such as Rubicon, an open source experiment management tool, and Kubeflow pipeline components that enable Capital One data scientists to efficiently leverage and scale models.

      <title>Mental Models for Advanced ChatGPT Prompting with Riley Goodside - #652</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/mental-models-for-advanced-chatgpt-prompting/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Riley Goodside, staff prompt engineer at Scale AI. In our conversation with Riley, we explore LLM capabilities and limitations, prompt engineering, and the mental models required to apply advanced prompting techniques. We dive deep into understanding LLM behavior, discussing the mechanism of autoregressive inference, comparing k-shot and zero-shot prompting, and dissecting the impact of RLHF. We also discuss the idea that prompting is a scaffolding structure that leverages the model context, resulting in achieving the desired model behavior and response rather than focusing solely on writing ability.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/multilingual-llms-and-the-values-divide-in-ai/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sara Hooker, director at Cohere and head of Cohere For AI, Cohere’s research lab. In our conversation with Sara, we explore some of the challenges with multilingual models like poor data quality and tokenization, and how they rely on data augmentation and preference training to address these bottlenecks. We also discuss the disadvantages and the motivating factors behind the Mixture of Experts technique, and the importance of common language between ML researchers and hardware architects to address the pain points in frameworks and create a better cohesion between the distinct communities. Sara also highlights the impact and the emotional connection that language models have created in society, the benefits and the current safety concerns of universal models, and the significance of having grounded conversations to characterize and mitigate the risk and development of AI models. Along the way, we also dive deep into Cohere and Cohere for AI, along with their Aya project, an open science project that aims to build a state-of-the-art multilingual generative language model as well as some of their recent research papers.

      <title>Personalization for Text-to-Image Generative AI with Nataniel Ruiz - #648</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/personalization-for-text-to-image-generative-ai/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Nataniel Ruiz, a research scientist at Google. In our conversation with Nataniel, we discuss his recent work around personalization for text-to-image AI models. Specifically, we dig into DreamBooth, an algorithm that enables “subject-driven generation,” that is, the creation of personalized generative models using a small set of user-provided images about a subject. The personalized models can then be used to generate the subject in various contexts using a text prompt. Nataniel gives us a dive deep into the fine-tuning approach used in DreamBooth, the potential reasons behind the algorithm’s effectiveness, the challenges of fine-tuning diffusion models in this way, such as language drift, and how the prior preservation loss technique avoids this setback, as well as the evaluation challenges and metrics used in DreamBooth. We also touched base on his other recent papers including SuTI, StyleDrop, HyperDreamBooth, and lastly, Platypus.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ensuring-llm-safety-for-production-applications/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Shreya Rajpal, founder and CEO of Guardrails AI. In our conversation with Shreya, we discuss ensuring the safety and reliability of language models for production applications. We explore the risks and challenges associated with these models, including different types of hallucinations and other LLM failure modes. We also talk about the susceptibility of the popular retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to closed-domain hallucination, and how this challenge can be addressed. We also cover the need for robust evaluation metrics and tooling for building with large language models. Lastly, we explore Guardrails, an open-source project that provides a catalog of validators that run on top of language models to enforce correctness and reliability efficiently.

      <title>Is ChatGPT Getting Worse? with James Zou - #645</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/is-chatgpt-getting-worse/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by James Zou, an assistant professor at Stanford University. In our conversation with James, we explore the differences in ChatGPT’s behavior over the last few months. We discuss the issues that can arise from inconsistencies in generative AI models, how he tested ChatGPT’s performance in various tasks, drawing comparisons between March 2023 and June 2023 for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions, and the possible reasons behind the declining performance of these models. James also shared his thoughts on how surgical AI editing akin to CRISPR could potentially revolutionize LLM and AI systems, and how adding monitoring tools can help in tracking behavioral changes in these models. Finally, we discuss James' recent paper on pathology image analysis using Twitter data, in which he explores the challenges of obtaining large medical datasets and data collection, as well as detailing the model’s architecture, training, and the evaluation process.

      <title>Why Deep Networks and Brains Learn Similar Features with Sophia Sanborn - #644</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/why-deep-networks-and-brains-learn-similar-features/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sophia Sanborn, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In our conversation with Sophia, we explore the concept of universality between neural representations and deep neural networks, and how these principles of efficiency provide an ability to find consistent features across networks and tasks. We also discuss her recent paper on Bispectral Neural Networks which focuses on Fourier transform and its relation to group theory, the implementation of bi-spectral spectrum in achieving invariance in deep neural networks, the expansion of geometric deep learning on the concept of CNNs from other domains, the similarities in the fundamental structure of artificial neural networks and biological neural networks and how applying similar constraints leads to the convergence of their solutions.

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning Without RL with Gokul Swamy - #643</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/inverse-reinforcement-learning-without-rl/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Gokul Swamy, a Ph.D. Student at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. In the final conversation of our ICML 2023 series, we sat down with Gokul to discuss his accepted papers at the event, leading off with “Inverse Reinforcement Learning without Reinforcement Learning.” In this paper, Gokul explores the challenges and benefits of inverse reinforcement learning, and the potential and advantages it holds for various applications. Next up, we explore the “Complementing a Policy with a Different Observation Space” paper which applies causal inference techniques to accurately estimate sampling balance and make decisions based on limited observed features. Finally, we touched on “Learning Shared Safety Constraints from Multi-task Demonstrations” which centers on learning safety constraints from demonstrations using the inverse reinforcement learning approach.

      <title>Transformers On Large-Scale Graphs with Bayan Bruss - #641</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/transformers-on-large-scale-graphs/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Bayan Bruss, Vice President of Applied ML Research at Capital One. In our conversation with Bayan, we covered a pair of papers his team presented at this year’s ICML conference. We begin with the paper Interpretable Subspaces in Image Representations, where Bayan gives us a dive deep into the interpretability framework, embedding dimensions, contrastive approaches, and how their model can accelerate image representation in deep learning. We also explore GOAT: A Global Transformer on Large-scale Graphs, a scalable global graph transformer. We talk through the computation challenges, homophilic and heterophilic principles, model sparsity, and how their research proposes methodologies to get around the computational barrier when scaling to large-scale graph models.

In our conversation with Bayan, we covered a pair of papers his team presented at this year’s ICML conference. We begin with the paper Interpretable Subspaces in Image Representations, where Bayan gives us a dive deep into the interpretability framework, embedding dimensions, contrastive approaches, and how their model can accelerate image representation in deep learning. We also explore GOAT: A Global Transformer on Large-scale Graphs, a scalable global graph transformer. We talk through the computation challenges, homophilic and heterophilic principles, model sparsity, and how their research proposes methodologies to get around the computational barrier when scaling to large-scale graph models.</p><p><br></p><p>The complete show notes for this episode can be found at <a href="twimlai.com/go/641">twimlai.com/go/641</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Language Modeling With State Space Models with Dan Fu - #630</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/language-modeling-with-state-space-models/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Dan Fu, a PhD student at Stanford University. In our conversation with Dan, we discuss the limitations of state space models in language modeling and the search for alternative building blocks that can help increase context length without being computationally infeasible. Dan walks us through the H3 architecture and Flash Attention technique, which can reduce the memory footprint of a model and make it feasible to fine-tune. We also explore his work on improving language models using synthetic languages, the issue of long sequence length affecting both training and inference in models, and the hope for finding something sub-quadratic that can perform language processing more effectively than the brute force approach of attention.

      <title>Building Maps and Spatial Awareness in Blind AI Agents with Dhruv Batra - #629</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/learning-maps-and-spatial-awareness-in-blind-ai-agents/</link>
      <description>Today we continue our coverage of ICLR 2023 joined by Dhruv Batra, an associate professor at Georgia Tech and research director of the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team at META. In our conversation, we discuss Dhruv’s work on the paper Emergence of Maps in the Memories of Blind Navigation Agents, which won an Outstanding Paper Award at the event. We explore navigation with multilayer LSTM and the question of whether embodiment is necessary for intelligence. We delve into the Embodiment Hypothesis and the progress being made in language models and caution on the responsible use of these models. We also discuss the history of AI and the importance of using the right data sets in training. The conversation explores the different meanings of "maps" across AI and cognitive science fields, Dhruv’s experience in navigating mapless systems, and the early discovery stages of memory representation and neural mechanisms.

      <title>Are LLMs Overhyped or Underappreciated? with Marti Hearst - #626</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/are-llms-overhyped-or-under-appreciated/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Marti Hearst, Professor at UC Berkeley. In our conversation with Marti, we explore the intricacies of AI language models and their usefulness in improving efficiency but also their potential for spreading misinformation. Marti expresses skepticism about whether these models truly have cognition compared to the nuance of the human brain. We discuss the intersection of language and visualization and the need for specialized research to ensure safety and appropriateness for specific uses. We also delve into the latest tools and algorithms such as Copilot and Chat GPT, which enhance programming and help in identifying comparisons, respectively. Finally, we discuss Marti’s long research history in search and her breakthrough in developing a standard interaction that allows for finding items on websites and library catalogs.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/runway-gen-2-generative-ai-for-video-creation/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Anastasis Germanidis, Co-Founder and CTO of RunwayML. Amongst all the product and model releases over the past few months, Runway threw its hat into the ring with Gen-1, a model that can take still images or video and transform them into completely stylized videos. They followed that up just a few weeks later with the release of Gen-2, a multimodal model that can produce a video from text prompts. We had the pleasure of chatting with Anastasis about both models, exploring the challenges of generating video, the importance of alignment in model deployment, the potential use of RLHF, the deployment of models as APIs, and much more!

      <title>Watermarking Large Language Models to Fight Plagiarism with Tom Goldstein - 621</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/watermarking-large-language-models-to-fight-plagiarism/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Tom Goldstein, an associate professor at the University of Maryland. Tom’s research sits at the intersection of ML and optimization and has previously been featured in the New Yorker for his work on invisibility cloaks, clothing that can evade object detection. In our conversation, we focus on his more recent research on watermarking LLM output. We explore the motivations behind adding these watermarks, how they work, and different ways a watermark could be deployed, as well as political and economic incentive structures around the adoption of watermarking and future directions for that line of work. We also discuss Tom’s research into data leakage, particularly in stable diffusion models, work that is analogous to recent guest Nicholas Carlini’s research into LLM data extraction. </description>

      <title>Does ChatGPT “Think”? A Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective with Anna Ivanova - #620</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/does-chatgpt-think-a-cognitive-neuroscience-perspective/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Anna Ivanova, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT Quest for Intelligence. In our conversation with Anna, we discuss her recent paper Dissociating language and thought in large language models: a cognitive perspective. In the paper, Anna reviews the capabilities of LLMs by considering their performance on two different aspects of language use: 'formal linguistic competence', which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given language, and 'functional linguistic competence', a host of cognitive abilities required for language understanding and use in the real world. We explore parallels between linguistic competence and AGI, the need to identify new benchmarks for these models, whether an end-to-end trained LLM can address various aspects of functional competence, and much more!

      <title>Robotic Dexterity and Collaboration with Monroe Kennedy III - #619</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/robotic-dexterity-and-collaboration/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Monroe Kennedy III, an assistant professor at Stanford, director of the Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab, and a national director of Black in Robotics. In our conversation with Monroe, we spend some time exploring the robotics landscape, getting Monroe’s thoughts on the current challenges in the field, as well as his opinion on choreographed demonstrations like the dancing Boston Robotics machines. We also dig into his work around two distinct threads, Robotic Dexterity, (what does it take to make robots capable of doing manipulation useful tasks with and for humans?) and Collaborative Robotics (how do we go beyond advanced autonomy in robots towards making effective robotic teammates capable of working with human counterparts?). Finally, we discuss DenseTact, an optical-tactile sensor capable of visualizing the deformed surface of a soft fingertip and using that image in a neural network to perform calibrated shape reconstruction and 6-axis wrench estimation.

      <title>Privacy and Security for Stable Diffusion and LLMs with Nicholas Carlini - #618</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/privacy-and-security-for-stable-diffusion-and-llms/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Nicholas Carlini, a research scientist at Google Brain. Nicholas works at the intersection of machine learning and computer security, and his recent paper “Extracting Training Data from LLMs” has generated quite a buzz within the ML community. In our conversation, we discuss the current state of adversarial machine learning research, the dynamic of dealing with privacy issues in black box vs accessible models, what privacy attacks in vision models like diffusion models look like, and the scale of “memorization” within these models. We also explore Nicholas’ work on data poisoning, which looks to understand what happens if a bad actor can take control of a small fraction of the data that an ML model is trained on.

      <title>Understanding AI’s Impact on Social Disparities with Vinodkumar Prabhakaran - #617</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/understanding-ais-impact-on-social-disparities/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, a Senior Research Scientist at Google Research. In our conversation with Vinod, we discuss his two main areas of research, using ML, specifically NLP, to explore these social disparities, and how these same social disparities are captured and propagated within machine learning tools. We explore a few specific projects, the first using NLP to analyze interactions between police officers and community members, determining factors like level of respect or politeness and how they play out across a spectrum of community members. We also discuss his work on understanding how bias creeps into the pipeline of building ML models, whether it be from the data or the person building the model. Finally, for those working with human annotators, Vinod shares his thoughts on how to incorporate principles of fairness to help build more robust models.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/supporting-food-security-in-africa-using-ml/</link>
      <description>Today we conclude our coverage of the 2022 NeurIPS series joined by Catherine Nakalembe, an associate research professor at the University of Maryland, and Africa Program Director under NASA Harvest. In our conversation with Catherine, we take a deep dive into her talk from the ML in the Physical Sciences workshop, Supporting Food Security in Africa using Machine Learning and Earth Observations. We discuss the broad challenges associated with food insecurity, as well as Catherine’s role and the priorities of Harvest Africa, a program focused on advancing innovative satellite-driven methods to produce automated within-season crop type and crop-specific condition products that support agricultural assessments. We explore some of the technical challenges of her work, including the limited, but growing, access to remote sensing and earth observation datasets and how the availability of that data has changed in recent years, the lack of benchmarks for the tasks she’s working on, examples of how they’ve applied techniques like multi-task learning and task-informed meta-learning, and much more.

      <title>Service Cards and ML Governance with Michael Kearns - #610</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/service-cards-and-ml-governance/</link>
      <description>Today we conclude our AWS re:Invent 2022 series joined by Michael Kearns, a professor in the department of computer and information science at UPenn, as well as an Amazon Scholar. In our conversation, we briefly explore Michael’s broader research interests in responsible AI and ML governance and his role at Amazon. We then discuss the announcement of service cards, and their take on “model cards” at a holistic, system level as opposed to an individual model level. We walk through the information represented on the cards, as well as explore the decision-making process around specific information being omitted from the cards. We also get Michael’s take on the years-old debate of algorithmic bias vs dataset bias, what some of the current issues are around this topic, and what research he has seen (and hopes to see) addressing issues of “fairness” in large language models.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Personalization at Spotify with Tony Jebara - #609</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/reinforcement-learning-lifetime-value-at-spotify/</link>
      <description>Today we continue our NeurIPS 2022 series joined by Tony Jebara, VP of engineering and head of machine learning at Spotify. In our conversation with Tony, we discuss his role at Spotify and how the company’s use of machine learning has evolved over the last few years, and the business value of machine learning, specifically recommendations, hold at the company.
We dig into his talk on the intersection of reinforcement learning and lifetime value (LTV) at Spotify, which explores the application of Offline RL for user experience personalization. We discuss the various papers presented in the talk, and how they all map toward determining and increasing a user’s LTV.

      <title>Will ChatGPT take my job? - #608</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/608</link>
      <description>More than any system before it, ChatGPT has tapped into our enduring fascination with artificial intelligence, raising in a more concrete and present way important questions and fears about what AI is capable of and how it will impact us as humans. One of the concerns most frequently voiced, whether sincerely or cloaked in jest, is how ChatGPT or systems like it, will impact our livelihoods. In other words, “will ChatGPT put me out of a job???” In this episode of the podcast, I seek to answer this very question by conducting an interview in which ChatGPT is asking all the questions. (The questions are answered by a second ChatGPT, as in my own recent Interview with it, Exploring Large Laguage Models with ChatGPT.) In addition to the straight dialogue, I include my own commentary along the way and conclude with a discussion of the results of the experiment, that is, whether I think ChatGPT will be taking my job as your host anytime soon. Ultimately, though, I hope you’ll be the judge of that and share your thoughts on how ChatGPT did at my job via a comment below or on social media.</description>

      <title>Geospatial Machine Learning at AWS with Kumar Chellapilla - #607</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/607</link>
      <description>Today we continue our re:Invent 2022 series joined by Kumar Chellapilla, a general manager of ML and AI Services at AWS. We had the opportunity to speak with Kumar after announcing their recent addition of geospatial data to the SageMaker Platform. In our conversation, we explore Kumar’s role as the GM for a diverse array of SageMaker services, what has changed in the geospatial data landscape over the last 10 years, and why Amazon decided now was the right time to invest in geospatial data. We discuss the challenges of accessing and working with this data and the pain points they’re trying to solve. Finally, Kumar walks us through a few customer use cases, describes how this addition will make users more effective than they currently are, and shares his thoughts on the future of this space over the next 2-5 years, including the potential intersection of geospatial data and stable diffusion/generative models.

      <title>Weakly Supervised Causal Representation Learning with Johann Brehmer - #605</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/605</link>
      <description>Today we’re excited to kick off our coverage of the 2022 NeurIPS conference with Johann Brehmer, a research scientist at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam. We begin our conversation discussing some of the broader problems that causality will help us solve, before turning our focus to Johann’s paper Weakly supervised causal representation learning, which seeks to prove that high-level causal representations are identifiable in weakly supervised settings. We also discuss a few other papers that the team at Qualcomm presented, including neural topological ordering for computation graphs, as well as some of the demos they showcased, which we’ll link to on the show notes page.

      <title>Stable Diffusion &amp; Generative AI with Emad Mostaque - #604</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/604</link>
      <description>Today we’re excited to kick off our 2022 AWS re:Invent series with a conversation with Emad Mostaque, Founder and CEO of Stability.ai. Stability.ai is a very popular name in the generative AI space at the moment, having taken the internet by storm with the release of its stable diffusion model just a few months ago. In our conversation with Emad, we discuss the story behind Stability's inception, the model's speed and scale, and the connection between stable diffusion and programming. We explore some of the spaces that Emad anticipates being disrupted by this technology, his thoughts on the open-source vs API debate, how they’re dealing with issues of user safety and artist attribution, and of course, what infrastructure they’re using to stand the model up.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/602</link>
      <description>Are AI-generating algorithms the path to artificial general intelligence(AGI)? 

Today we’re joined by Jeff Clune, an associate professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia, and faculty member at the Vector Institute. In our conversation with Jeff, we discuss the broad ambitious goal of the AI field, artificial general intelligence, where we are on the path to achieving it, and his opinion on what we should be doing to get there, specifically, focusing on AI generating algorithms. With the goal of creating open-ended algorithms that can learn forever, Jeff shares his three pillars to an AI-GA, meta-learning architectures, meta-learning algorithms, and auto-generating learning environments. Finally, we discuss the inherent safety issues with these learning algorithms and Jeff’s thoughts on how to combat them, and what the not-so-distant future holds for this area of research.

      <title>Engineering Production NLP Systems at T-Mobile with Heather Nolis - #600</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/600</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Heather Nolis, a principal machine learning engineer at T-Mobile. In our conversation with Heather, we explored her machine learning journey at T-Mobile, including their initial proof of concept project, which held the goal of putting their first real-time deep learning model into production. We discuss the use case, which aimed to build a model customer intent model that would pull relevant information about a customer during conversations with customer support. This process has now become widely known as blank assist. We also discuss the decision to use supervised learning to solve this problem and the challenges they faced when developing a taxonomy. Finally, we explore the idea of using small models vs uber-large models, the hardware being used to stand up their infrastructure, and how Heather thinks about the age-old question of build vs buy. </description>

      <title>Sim2Real and Optimus, the Humanoid Robot with Ken Goldberg - #599</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/599</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by return guest Ken Goldberg, a professor at UC Berkeley and the chief scientist at Ambi Robotics. It’s been a few years since our initial conversation with Ken, so we spent a bit of time talking through the progress that has been made in robotics in the time that has passed. We discuss Ken’s recent work, including the paper Autonomously Untangling Long Cables, which won Best Systems Paper at the RSS conference earlier this year, including the complexity of the problem and why it is classified as a systems challenge, as well as the advancements in hardware that made solving this problem possible. We also explore Ken’s thoughts on the push towards simulation by research entities and large tech companies, and the potential for causal modeling to find its way into robotics. Finally, we discuss the recent showcase of Optimus, Tesla, and Elon Musk’s “humanoid” robot and how far we are from it being a viable piece of technology.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/the-great-mlops-debate-end-to-end-ml-platforms-vs-specialized-tools/</link>
      <description>Over the last few years, it’s been established that your ML team needs at least some basic tooling in order to be effective, providing support for various aspects of the machine learning workflow, from data acquisition and management, to model development and optimization, to model deployment and monitoring.
But how do you get there? Many tools available off the shelf, both commercial and open source, can help.
At the extremes, these tools can fall into one of a couple of buckets. End-to-end platforms that try to provide support for many aspects of the ML lifecycle, and specialized tools that offer deep functionality in a particular domain or area.
At TWIMLcon: AI Platforms 2022, our panelists debated the merits of these approaches in The Great MLOps Debate: End-to-End ML Platforms vs Specialized Tools.</description>

      <title>Live from TWIMLcon! You're not Facebook. Architecting MLOps for B2B Use Cases with Jacopo Tagliabue - #596</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/youre-not-facebook-architecting-mlops-for-b2b-use-cases-with-jacopo-tagliabue/</link>
      <description>Much of the way we talk and think about MLOps comes from the perspective of large consumer internet companies like Facebook or Google. If you work at a FAANG company, these approaches might work well for you. But what about if you work at one of the many small, B2B companies that stand to benefit through the use of machine learning? How should you be thinking about MLOps and the ML lifecycle in that case? In this live podcast interview from TWIMLcon: AI Platforms 2022, Sam Charrington explores these questions with Jacopo Tagliabue, whose perspectives and contributions on scaling down MLOps have served to make the field more accessible and relevant to a wider array of practitioners.</description>

      <title>Building Foundational ML Platforms with Kubernetes and Kubeflow with Ali Rodell - #595</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/building-foundational-ml-platforms-with-kubernetes-and-kubeflow-with-ali-rodell/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Ali Rodell, a senior director of machine learning engineering at Capital One. In our conversation with Ali, we explore his role as the head of model development platforms at Capital One, including how his 25+ years in software development have shaped his view on building platforms and the evolution of the platforms space over the last 10 years. We discuss the importance of a healthy open source tooling ecosystem, Capital One’s use of various open source capabilites like kubeflow and kubernetes to build out platforms, and some of the challenges that come along with modifying/customizing these tools to work for him and his teams. Finally, we explore the range of user personas that need to be accounted for when making decisions about tooling, supporting things like Jupyter notebooks and other low level tools, and how that can be potentially challenging in a highly regulated environment like the financial industry.

      <title>AI-Powered Peer Programming with Vasi Philomin - #594</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ai-powered-peer-programming-with-vasi-philomin/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Vasi Philomin, vice president of AI services at AWS, joins us for our first in-person interview since 2019! In our conversation with Vasi, we discussed the recently released Amazon Code Whisperer, a developer-focused coding companion. We begin by exploring Vasi’s role and the various products under the banner of cognitive and non-cognitive services, and how those came together where Code Whisperer fits into the equation and some of the differences between Code Whisperer and some of the other recently released coding companions like GitHub Copilot. We also discuss the training corpus for the model, and how they’ve dealt with the potential issues of bias that arise when training LLMs with crawled web data, and Vasi’s thoughts on what the path of innovation looks like for Code Whisperer. 
At the end of our conversation, Vasi was gracious enough to share a quick live demo of Code Whisperer, so you can catch that here.</description>

      <title>Assessing Data Quality at Shopify with Wendy Foster - #592</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/assessing-data-quality-at-shopify-with-wendy-foster/</link>
      <description>Today we’re back with another installment of our Data-Centric AI series, joined by Wendy Foster, a director of engineering &amp; data science at Shopify. In our conversation with Wendy, we explore the differences between data-centric and model-centric approaches and how they manifest at Shopify, including on her team, which is responsible for utilizing merchant and product data to assist individual vendors on the platform. We discuss how they address, maintain, and improve data quality, emphasizing the importance of coverage and “freshness” data when solving constantly evolving use cases. Finally, we discuss how data is taxonomized at the company and the challenges that present themselves when producing large-scale ML models, future use cases that Wendy expects her team to tackle, and we briefly explore Merlin, Shopify’s new ML platform (that you can hear more about at TWIMLcon!), and how it fits into the broader scope of ML at the company.

      <title>Transformers for Tabular Data at Capital One with Bayan Bruss - #591</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/transformers-for-tabular-data-at-capital-one-with-bayan-bruss/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Bayan Bruss, a Sr. director of applied ML research at Capital One. In our conversation with Bayan, we dig into his work in applying various deep learning techniques to tabular data, including taking advancements made in other areas like graph CNNs and other traditional graph mining algorithms and applying them to financial services applications. We discuss why despite a “flood” of innovation in the field, work on tabular data doesn’t elicit as much fanfare despite its broad use across businesses, Bayan’s experience with the difficulty of making deep learning work on tabular data, and what opportunities have been presented for the field with the emergence of multi-modality and transformer models. We also explore a pair of papers from Bayan’s team, focused on both transformers and transfer learning for tabular data.

      <itunes:summary>Today we’re joined by Bayan Bruss, a Sr. director of applied ML research at Capital One. In our conversation with Bayan, we dig into his work in applying various deep learning techniques to tabular data, including taking advancements made in other areas like graph CNNs and other traditional graph mining algorithms and applying them to financial services applications. We discuss why despite a “flood” of innovation in the field, work on tabular data doesn’t elicit as much fanfare despite its broad use across businesses, Bayan’s experience with the difficulty of making deep learning work on tabular data, and what opportunities have been presented for the field with the emergence of multi-modality and transformer models. We also explore a pair of papers from Bayan’s team, focused on both transformers and transfer learning for tabular data.

      <title>Understanding Collective Insect Communication with ML, w/ Orit Peleg - #590</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/understanding-collective-insect-communication-with-ml-w-orig-peleg/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Orit Peleg, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Orit’s work focuses on understanding the behavior of disordered living systems, by merging tools from physics, biology, engineering, and computer science. In our conversation, we discuss how Orit found herself exploring problems of swarming behaviors and their relationship to distributed computing system architecture and spiking neurons. We look at two specific areas of research, the first focused on the patterns observed in firefly species, how the data is collected, and the types of algorithms used for optimization. Finally, we look at how Orit’s research with fireflies translates to a completely different insect, the honeybee, and what the next steps are for investigating these and other insect families.

      <title>Causal Conceptions of Fairness and their Consequences with Sharad Goel - #586</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/causal-conceptions-of-fairness-and-their-consequences-with-sharad-goel/</link>
      <description>Today we close out our ICML 2022 coverage joined by Sharad Goel, a professor of public policy at Harvard University. In our conversation with Sharad, we discuss his Outstanding Paper award winner Causal Conceptions of Fairness and their Consequences, which seeks to understand what it means to apply causality to the idea of fairness in ML. We explore the two broad classes of intent that have been conceptualized under the subfield of causal fairness and how they differ, the distinct ways causality is treated in economic and statistical contexts vs a computer science and algorithmic context, and why policies are created in the context of causal definitions are suboptimal broadly.

      <title>Equivariant Priors for Compressed Sensing with Arash Behboodi - #584</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/equivariant-priors-for-compressed-sensing-with-arash-behboodi/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Arash Behboodi, a machine learning researcher at Qualcomm Technologies. In our conversation with Arash, we explore his paper Equivariant Priors for Compressed Sensing with Unknown Orientation, which proposes using equivariant generative models as a prior means to show that signals with unknown orientations can be recovered with iterative gradient descent on the latent space of these models and provide additional theoretical recovery guarantees. We discuss the differences between compression and compressed sensing, how he was able to evolve a traditional VAE architecture to understand equivalence, and some of the research areas he’s applying this work, including cryo-electron microscopy. We also discuss a few of the other papers that his colleagues have submitted to the conference, including Overcoming Oscillations in Quantization-Aware Training, Variational On-the-Fly Personalization, and CITRIS: Causal Identifiability from Temporal Intervened Sequences.

      <title>On The Path Towards Robot Vision with Aljosa Osep - #581</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/on-the-path-towards-robot-vision-with-aljosa-osep/</link>
      <description>Today we wrap up our coverage of the 2022 CVPR conference joined by Aljosa Osep, a postdoc at the Technical University of Munich &amp; Carnegie Mellon University. In our conversation with Aljosa, we explore his broader research interests in achieving robot vision, and his vision for what it will look like when that goal is achieved. The first paper we dig into is Text2Pos: Text-to-Point-Cloud Cross-Modal Localization, which proposes a cross-modal localization module that learns to align textual descriptions with localization cues in a coarse-to-fine manner. Next up, we explore the paper Forecasting from LiDAR via Future Object Detection, which proposes an end-to-end approach for detection and motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground truth tracks. Finally, we discuss Aljosa’s third and final paper Opening up Open-World Tracking, which proposes a new benchmark to analyze existing efforts in multi-object tracking and constructs a baseline for these tasks.

      <title>More Language, Less Labeling with Kate Saenko - #580</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/more-language-less-labeling-with-kate-saenko/</link>
      <description>Today we continue our CVPR series joined by Kate Saenko, an associate professor at Boston University and a consulting professor for the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. In our conversation with Kate, we explore her research in multimodal learning, which she spoke about at the Multimodal Learning and Applications Workshop, one of a whopping 6 workshops she spoke at. We discuss the emergence of multimodal learning, the current research frontier, and Kate’s thoughts on the inherent bias in LLMs and how to deal with it. We also talk through some of the challenges that come up when building out applications, including the cost of labeling, and some of the methods she’s had success with. Finally, we discuss Kate’s perspective on the monopolizing of computing resources for “foundational” models, and her paper Unsupervised Domain Generalization by learning a Bridge Across Domains.

      <title>Optical Flow Estimation, Panoptic Segmentation, and Vision Transformers with Fatih Porikli - #579</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/optical-flow-estimation-panoptic-segmentation-and-vision-transformers-with-fatih-porikli/</link>
      <description>Today we kick off our annual coverage of the CVPR conference joined by Fatih Porikli, Senior Director of Engineering at Qualcomm AI Research. In our conversation with Fatih, we explore a trio of CVPR-accepted papers, as well as a pair of upcoming workshops at the event. The first paper, Panoptic, Instance and Semantic Relations: A Relational Context Encoder to Enhance Panoptic Segmentation, presents a novel framework to integrate semantic and instance contexts for panoptic segmentation. Next up, we discuss Imposing Consistency for Optical Flow Estimation, a paper that introduces novel and effective consistency strategies for optical flow estimation. The final paper we discuss is IRISformer: Dense Vision Transformers for Single-Image Inverse Rendering in Indoor Scenes, which proposes a transformer architecture to simultaneously estimate depths, normals, spatially-varying albedo, roughness, and lighting from a single image of an indoor scene. For each paper, we explore the motivations and challenges and get concrete examples to demonstrate each problem and solution presented.

      <title>Data Governance for Data Science with Adam Wood - #578</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/data-governance-for-data-science-with-adam-wood/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Adam Wood, Director of Data Governance and Data Quality at Mastercard. In our conversation with Adam, we explore the challenges that come along with data governance at a global scale, including dealing with regional regulations like GDPR and federating records at scale. We discuss the role of feature stores in keeping track of data lineage and how Adam and his team have dealt with the challenges of metadata management, how large organizations like Mastercard are dealing with enabling feature reuse, and the steps they take to alleviate bias, especially in scenarios like acquisitions. Finally, we explore data quality for data science and why Adam sees it as an encouraging area of growth within the company, as well as the investments they’ve made in tooling around data management, catalog, feature management, and more.

      <itunes:summary>Today we’re joined by Adam Wood, Director of Data Governance and Data Quality at Mastercard. In our conversation with Adam, we explore the challenges that come along with data governance at a global scale, including dealing with regional regulations like GDPR and federating records at scale. We discuss the role of feature stores in keeping track of data lineage and how Adam and his team have dealt with the challenges of metadata management, how large organizations like Mastercard are dealing with enabling feature reuse, and the steps they take to alleviate bias, especially in scenarios like acquisitions. Finally, we explore data quality for data science and why Adam sees it as an encouraging area of growth within the company, as well as the investments they’ve made in tooling around data management, catalog, feature management, and more.

      <title>Feature Platforms for Data-Centric AI with Mike Del Balso - #577</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/feature-platforms-for-data-centric-ai-mike-del-balso/</link>
      <description>In the latest installment of our Data-Centric AI series, we’re joined by a friend of the show Mike Del Balso, Co-founder and CEO of Tecton. If you’ve heard any of our other conversations with Mike, you know we spend a lot of time discussing feature stores, or as he now refers to them, feature platforms. We explore the current complexity of data infrastructure broadly and how that has changed over the last five years, as well as the maturation of streaming data platforms. We discuss the wide vs deep paradox that exists around ML tooling, and the idea around the “ML Flywheel”, a strategy that leverages data to accelerate machine learning. Finally, we spend time discussing internal ML team construction, some of the challenges that organizations face when building their ML platforms teams, and how they can avoid the pitfalls as they arise.

      <title>The Fallacy of "Ground Truth" with Shayan Mohanty - #576</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/the-fallacy-of-ground-turth-with-shayan-mohanty/</link>
      <description>Today we continue our Data-centric AI series joined by Shayan Mohanty, CEO at Watchful. In our conversation with Shayan, we focus on the data labeling aspect of the machine learning process, and ways that a data-centric approach could add value and reduce cost by multiple orders of magnitude. Shayan helps us define “data-centric”, while discussing the main challenges that organizations face when dealing with labeling, how these problems are currently being solved, and how techniques like active learning and weak supervision could be used to more effectively label. We also explore the idea of machine teaching, which focuses on using techniques that make the model training process more efficient, and what organizations need to be successful when trying to make the aforementioned mindset shift to DCAI.

      <title>Data Debt in Machine Learning with D. Sculley - #574</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/data-debt-in-machine-learning/</link>
      <description>Today we kick things off with a conversation with D. Sculley, a director on the Google Brain team. Many listeners of today’s show will know D. from his work on the paper, The Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems, and of course, the infamous diagram. D. has recently translated the idea of technical debt into data debt, something we spend a bit of time on in the interview.
We discuss his view of the concept of DCAI, where debt fits into the conversation of data quality, and what a shift towards data-centrism looks like in a world of increasingly larger models i.e. GPT-3 and the recent PALM models. We also explore common sources of data debt, what are things that the community can and have done to mitigate these issues, the usefulness of causal inference graphs in this work, and much more! If you enjoyed this interview or want to hear more on this topic, check back on the DCAI series page weekly at https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/series/data-centric-ai.

      <title>AI for Enterprise Decisioning at Scale with Rob Walker - #573</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/ai-for-enterprise-decisioning-at-scale/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Rob Walker, VP of decisioning &amp; analytics and gm of one-to-one customer engagement at Pegasystems. Rob, who you might know from his previous appearances on the podcast, joins us to discuss his work on AI and ML in the context of customer engagement and decisioning, the various problems that need to be solved, including solving the “next best” problem. We explore the distinction between the idea of the next best action and determining it from a recommender system, how the combination of machine learning and heuristics are currently co-existing in engagements, scaling model evaluation, and some of the challenges they’re facing when dealing with problems of responsible AI and how they’re managed. Finally, we spend a few minutes digging into the upcoming PegaWorld conference, and what attendees should anticipate at the event.

      <title>Data Rights, Quantification and Governance for Ethical AI with Margaret Mitchell - #572</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/data-rights-quantification-and-governance-for-ethical-ai-with-margaret-mitchell/</link>
      <description>Today we close out our coverage of the ICLR series joined by Meg Mitchell, chief ethics scientist and researcher at Hugging Face. In our conversation with Meg, we discuss her participation in the WikiM3L Workshop, as well as her transition into her new role at Hugging Face, which has afforded her the ability to prioritize coding in her work around AI ethics. We explore her thoughts on the work happening in the fields of data curation and data governance, her interest in the inclusive sharing of datasets and creation of models that don't disproportionately underperform or exploit subpopulations, and how data collection practices have changed over the years. 
We also touch on changes to data protection laws happening in some pretty uncertain places, the evolution of her work on Model Cards, and how she’s using this and recent Data Cards work to lower the barrier to entry to responsibly informed development of data and sharing of data.

      <title>Studying Machine Intelligence with Been Kim - #571</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/studying-machine-intelligence-with-been-kim/</link>
      <description>Today we continue our ICLR coverage joined by Been Kim, a staff research scientist at Google Brain, and an ICLR 2022 Invited Speaker. Been, whose research has historically been focused on interpretability in machine learning, delivered the keynote Beyond interpretability: developing a language to shape our relationships with AI, which explores the need to study AI machines as scientific objects, in isolation and with humans, which will provide principles for tools, but also is necessary to take our working relationship with AI to the next level. 
Before we dig into Been’s talk, she characterizes where we are as an industry and community with interpretability, and what the current state of the art is for interpretability techniques. We explore how the Gestalt principles appear in neural networks, Been’s choice to characterize communication with machines as a language as opposed to a set of principles or foundational understanding, and much much more.

      <title>Advances in Neural Compression with Auke Wiggers - #570</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/advances-in-neural-compression-with-auke-wiggers/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Auke Wiggers, an AI research scientist at Qualcomm. In our conversation with Auke, we discuss his team’s recent research on data compression using generative models. We discuss the relationship between historical compression research and the current trend of neural compression, and the benefit of neural codecs, which learn to compress data from examples. We also explore the performance evaluation process and the recent developments that show that these models can operate in real-time on a mobile device. Finally, we discuss another ICLR paper, “Transformer-based transform coding”, that proposes a vision transformer-based architecture for image and video coding, and some of his team’s other accepted works at the conference.

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts and Trends in Large-Scale Language Modeling with Irwan Bello - #569</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/mixture-of-experts-and-trends-in-large-scale-language-modeling-with-irwan-bello</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Irwan Bello, formerly a research scientist at Google Brain, and now on the founding team at a stealth AI startup. We begin our conversation with an exploration of Irwan’s recent paper, Designing Effective Sparse Expert Models, which acts as a design guide for building sparse large language model architectures. We discuss mixture of experts as a technique, the scalability of this method, and it's applicability beyond NLP tasks the data sets this experiment was benchmarked against. We also explore Irwan’s interest in the research areas of alignment and retrieval, talking through interesting lines of work for each area including instruction tuning and direct alignment.

      <title>Daring to DAIR: Distributed AI Research with Timnit Gebru - #568</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/daring-to-dair-distributed-ai-research-with-timnit-gebru</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by friend of the show Timnit Gebru, the founder and executive director of DAIR, the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute. In our conversation with Timnit, we discuss her journey to create DAIR, their goals and some of the challenges shes faced along the way. We start is the obvious place, Timnit being “resignated” from Google after writing and publishing a paper detailing the dangers of large language models, the fallout from that paper and her firing, and the eventual founding of DAIR. We discuss the importance of the “distributed” nature of the institute, how they’re going about figuring out what is in scope and out of scope for the institute’s research charter, and what building an institution means to her. We also explore the importance of independent alternatives to traditional research structures, if we should be pessimistic about the impact of internal ethics and responsible AI teams in industry due to the overwhelming power they wield, examples she looks to of what not to do when building out the institute, and much much more!

      <title>Hierarchical and Continual RL with Doina Precup - #567</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/hierarchical-and-continual-rl-with-doina-precup</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Doina Precup, a research team lead at DeepMind Montreal, and a professor at McGill University. In our conversation with Doina, we discuss her recent research interests, including her work in hierarchical reinforcement learning, with the goal being agents learning abstract representations, especially over time. We also explore her work on reward specification for RL agents, where she hypothesizes that a reward signal in a complex environment could lead an agent to develop attributes of intuitive intelligence. We also dig into quite a few of her papers, including On the Expressivity of Markov Reward, which won a NeruIPS 2021 outstanding paper award. Finally, we discuss the analogy between hierarchical RL and CNNs, her work in continual RL, and her thoughts on the evolution of RL in the recent past and present, and the biggest challenges facing the field going forward.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/big-science-and-embodied-learning-at-hugging-face-%F0%9F%A4%97-with-thomas-wolf</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face 🤗. We cover a ton of ground In our conversation, starting with Thomas’ interesting backstory as a quantum physicist and patent lawyer, and how that lead him to a career in machine learning. We explore how Hugging Face began, what the current direction is for the company, and how much of their focus is NLP and language models versus other disciplines. We also discuss the BigScience project, a year-long research workshop where 1000+ researchers of all backgrounds and disciplines have come together to create an 800GB multilingual dataset and model. We talk through their approach to curating the dataset, model evaluation at this scale, and how they differentiate their work from projects like Eluther AI. Finally, we dig into Thomas’ work on multimodality, his thoughts on the metaverse, his new book NLP with Transformers, and much more!

      <title>Full-Stack AI Systems Development with Murali Akula - #563</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/full-stack-ai-systems-development-with-murali-akula</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Murali Akula, a Sr. director of Software Engineering at Qualcomm. In our conversation with Murali, we explore his role at Qualcomm, where he leads the corporate research team focused on the development and deployment of AI onto Snapdragon chips, their unique definition of “full stack”, and how that philosophy permeates into every step of the software development process. We explore the complexities that are unique to doing machine learning on resource constrained devices, some of the techniques that are being applied to get complex models working on mobile devices, and the process for taking these models from research into real-world applications. We also discuss a few more tools and recent developments, including DONNA for neural architecture search, X-Distill, a method of improving the self-supervised training of monocular depth, and the AI Model Effeciency Toolkit, a library that provides advanced quantization and compression techniques for trained neural network models.

      <title>100x Improvements in Deep Learning Performance with Sparsity, w/ Subutai Ahmad - #562</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/100x-improvements-in-deep-learning-performance-with-sparsity-with-subutai-ahmad</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Subutai Ahmad, VP of research at Numenta. While we’ve had numerous conversations about the biological inspirations of deep learning models with folks working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience, we dig into uncharted territory with Subutai. We set the stage by digging into some of fundamental ideas behind Numenta’s research and the present landscape of neuroscience, before exploring our first big topic of the podcast: the cortical column. Cortical columns are a group of neurons in the cortex of the brain which have nearly identical receptive fields; we discuss the behavior of these columns, why they’re a structure worth mimicing computationally, how far along we are in understanding the cortical column, and how these columns relate to neurons.
 
We also discuss what it means for a model to have inherent 3d understanding and for computational models to be inherently sensory motor, and where we are with these lines of research. Finally, we dig into our other big idea, sparsity. We explore the fundamental ideals of sparsity and the differences between sparse and dense networks, and applying sparsity and optimization to drive greater efficiency in current deep learning networks, including transformers and other large language models.

      <description>Today we’re joined by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, an assistant professor at Purdue University, to close out our AI Rewind 2021 series! In this conversation, we focused on all things deep reinforcement learning, starting with a general overview of the direction of the field, and though it might seem to be slowing, thats just a product of the light being shined constantly on the CV and NLP spaces. We dig into themes like the convergence of RL methodology with both robotics and control theory, as well as a few trends that Kamyar sees over the horizon, such as self-supervised learning approaches in RL. We also talk through Kamyar’s predictions for RL in 2022 and beyond. This was a fun conversation, and I encourage you to look through all the great resources that Kamyar shared on the show notes page at twimlai.com/go/560!</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice with Rishabh Agarwal - #559</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-at-the-edge-of-the-statistical-precipice-with-rishabh-agarwal</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Rishabh Agarwal, a research scientist at Google Brain in Montreal. In our conversation with Rishabh, we discuss his recent paper Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice, which won an outstanding paper award at the most recent NeurIPS conference. In this paper, Rishabh and his coauthors call for a change in how deep RL performance is reported on benchmarks when using only a few runs, acknowledging that typically, DeepRL algorithms are evaluated by the performance on a large suite of tasks. Using the Atari 100k benchmark, they found substantial disparities in the conclusions from point estimates alone versus statistical analysis. We explore the reception of this paper from the research community, some of the more surprising results, what incentives researchers have to implement these types of changes in self-reporting when publishing, and much more.

We explore the reception of this paper from the research community, some of the more surprising results, what incentives researchers have to implement these types of changes in self-reporting when publishing, and much more.</p><p><br></p><p>The complete show notes for this episode can be found at <a href="twimlai.com/go/559">twimlai.com/go/559</a></p>]]>

      <title>Designing New Energy Materials with Machine Learning with Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli - #558</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/designing-new-energy-materials-with-machine-learning-with-rafael-gomez-bombarelli</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli, an assistant professor in the department of material science and engineering at MIT. In our conversation with Rafa, we explore his goal of ​​fusing machine learning and atomistic simulations for designing materials, a topic he spoke about at the recent SigOpt AI &amp; HPC Summit. We discuss the two ways in which he thinks of material design, virtual screening and inverse design, as well as the unique challenges each technique presents. We also talk through the use of generative models for simulation, the type of training data necessary for these tasks, and if he’s building hand-coded simulations vs existing packages or tools. Finally, we explore the dynamic relationship between simulation and modeling and how the results of one drive the others efforts, and how hyperparameter optimization gets incorporated into the various projects.

      <title>Solving the Cocktail Party Problem with Machine Learning, w/ ‪Jonathan Le Roux - #555</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/solving-the-cocktail-party-problem-with-machine-learning-w-jonathan-le-roux/</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jonathan Le Roux, a senior principal research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL). At MERL, Jonathan and his team are focused on using machine learning to solve the “cocktail party problem”, focusing on not only the separation of speech from noise, but also the separation of speech from speech. In our conversation with Jonathan, we focus on his paper The Cocktail Fork Problem: Three-Stem Audio Separation For Real-World Soundtracks, which looks to separate and enhance a complex acoustic scene into three distinct categories, speech, music, and sound effects. We explore the challenges of working with such noisy data, the model architecture used to solve this problem, how ML/DL fits into solving the larger cocktail party problem, future directions for this line of research, and much more!

      <title>Machine Learning for Earthquake Seismology with Karianne Bergen - #554</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/machine-learning-for-earthquake-seismology-with-karianne-bergen</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Karianne Bergen, an assistant professor at Brown University. In our conversation with Karianne, we explore her work at the intersection of earthquake seismology and machine learning, where she’s working on interpretable data classification for seismology. We discuss some of the challenges that present themselves when trying to solve this problem, and the state of applying machine learning to seismological events and earth sciences. Karianne also shares her thoughts on the different relationships that computer scientists and natural scientists have with machine learning, and how to bridge that gap to create tools that work broadly for all scientists.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/the-new-dbfication-of-ml-ai-with-arun-kumar</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Arun Kumarm, an associate professor at UC San Diego. We had the pleasure of catching up with Arun prior to the Workshop on Databases and AI at NeurIPS 2021, where he delivered the talk “The New DBfication of ML/AI.” In our conversation, we explore this “database-ification” of machine learning, a concept analogous to the transformation of relational SQL computation. We discuss the relationship between the ML and database fields and how the merging of the two could have positive outcomes for the end-to-end ML workflow, and a few tools that his team has developed, Cerebro, a tool for reproducible model selection, and SortingHat, a tool for automating data prep, and how tools like these and others affect Arun’s outlook on the future of machine learning platforms and MLOps.

      <title>Building Public Interest Technology with Meredith Broussard - #552</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/building-public-interest-technology-with-meredith-broussard</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Meredith Broussard, an associate professor at NYU &amp; research director at the NYU Alliance for Public Interest Technology. Meredith was a keynote speaker at the recent NeurIPS conference, and we had the pleasure of speaking with her to discuss her talk from the event, and her upcoming book, tentatively titled More Than A Glitch: What Everyone Needs To Know About Making Technology Anti-Racist, Accessible, And Otherwise Useful To All.
In our conversation, we explore Meredith’s work in the field of public interest technology, and her view of the relationship between technology and artificial intelligence. Meredith and Sam talk through real-world scenarios where an emphasis on monitoring bias and responsibility would positively impact outcomes, and how this type of monitoring parallels the infrastructure that many organizations are already building out. Finally, we talk through the main takeaways from Meredith’s NeurIPS talk, and how practitioners can get involved in the work of building and deploying public interest technology.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today we’re joined by Meredith Broussard, an associate professor at NYU &amp; research director at the NYU Alliance for Public Interest Technology. Meredith was a keynote speaker at the recent NeurIPS conference, and we had the pleasure of speaking with her to discuss her talk from the event, and her upcoming book, tentatively titled <em>More Than A Glitch: What Everyone Needs To Know About Making Technology Anti-Racist, Accessible, And Otherwise Useful To All.</em></p><p>In our conversation, we explore Meredith’s work in the field of public interest technology, and her view of the relationship between technology and artificial intelligence. Meredith and Sam talk through real-world scenarios where an emphasis on monitoring bias and responsibility would positively impact outcomes, and how this type of monitoring parallels the infrastructure that many organizations are already building out. Finally, we talk through the main takeaways from Meredith’s NeurIPS talk, and how practitioners can get involved in the work of building and deploying public interest technology.</p><p>The complete show notes for this episode can be found at <a href="twimlai.com/go/552">twimlai.com/go/552</a></p>]]>

      <title>A Universal Law of Robustness via Isoperimetry with Sebastien Bubeck - #551</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/a-universal-law-of-robustness-via-isoperimetry-with-sebastien-bubeck</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sebastian Bubeck a sr principal research manager at Microsoft, and author of the paper A Universal Law of Robustness via Isoperimetry, a NeurIPS 2021 Outstanding Paper Award recipient. We begin our conversation with Sebastian with a bit of a primer on convex optimization, a topic that hasn’t come up much in previous interviews. We explore the problem that convex optimization is trying to solve, the application of convex optimization to multi-armed bandit problems, metrical task systems and solving the K-server problem. We then dig into Sebastian’s paper, which looks to prove that for a broad class of data distributions and model classes, overparameterization is necessary if one wants to interpolate the data. Finally, we discussed the relationship between the paper and the work being done in the adversarial robustness community.

      <title>Trends in NLP with John Bohannon - #550</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/trends-in-nlp-with-john-bohannon</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by friend of the show John Bohannon, the director of science at Primer AI, to help us showcase all of the great achievements and accomplishments in NLP in 2021! In our conversation, John shares his two major takeaways from last year, 1) NLP as we know it has changed, and we’re back into the incremental phase of the science, and 2) NLP is “eating” the rest of machine learning. We explore the implications of these two major themes across the discipline, as well as best papers, up and coming startups, great things that did happen, and even a few bad things that didn’t. Finally, we explore what 2022 and beyond will look like for NLP, from multilingual NLP to use cases for the influx of large auto-regressive language models like GPT-3 and others, as well as ethical implications that are reverberating across domains and the changes that have been ushered in in that vein.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/trends-in-computer-vision-with-georgia-gkioxari</link>
      <description>Happy New Year! We’re excited to kick off 2022 joined by Georgia Gkioxari, a research scientist at Meta AI, to showcase the best advances in the field of computer vision over the past 12 months, and what the future holds for this domain. 
Welcome back to AI Rewind!
In our conversation Georgia highlights the emergence of the transformer model in CV research, what kind of performance results we’re seeing vs CNNs, and the immediate impact of NeRF, amongst a host of other great research. We also explore what is ImageNet’s place in the current landscape, and if it's time to make big changes to push the boundaries of what is possible with image, video and even 3D data, with challenges like the Metaverse, amongst others, on the horizon. Finally, we touch on the startups to keep an eye on, the collaborative efforts of software and hardware researchers, and the vibe of the “ImageNet moment” being upon us once again.

      <title>Kids Run the Darndest Experiments: Causal Learning in Children with Alison Gopnik - #548</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/kids-run-the-darndest-experiments-causal-learning-in-children-with-alison-gopnik</link>
      <description>Today we close out the 2021 NeurIPS series joined by Alison Gopnik, a professor at UC Berkeley and an invited speaker at the Causal Inference &amp; Machine Learning: Why now? Workshop. In our conversation with Alison, we explore the question, “how is it that we can know so much about the world around us from so little information?,” and how her background in psychology, philosophy, and epistemology has guided her along the path to finding this answer through the actions of children. We discuss the role of causality as a means to extract representations of the world and how the “theory theory” came about, and how it was demonstrated to have merit. We also explore the complexity of causal relationships that children are able to deal with and what that can tell us about our current ML models, how the training and inference stages of the ML lifecycle are akin to childhood and adulthood, and much more!

      <link>https://twimlai.com/hypergraphs-simplicial-complexes-and-graph-representations-of-complex-systems-with-tina-eliassi-rad</link>
      <description>Today we continue our NeurIPS coverage joined by Tina Eliassi-Rad, a professor at Northeastern University, and an invited speaker at the I Still Can't Believe It's Not Better! Workshop. In our conversation with Tina, we explore her research at the intersection of network science, complex networks, and machine learning, how graphs are used in her work and how it differs from typical graph machine learning use cases. We also discuss her talk from the workshop, “The Why, How, and When of Representations for Complex Systems”, in which Tina argues that one of the reasons practitioners have struggled to model complex systems is because of the lack of connection to the data sourcing and generation process. This is definitely a NERD ALERT approved interview!

      <title>Deep Learning, Transformers, and the Consequences of Scale with Oriol Vinyals - #546</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/deep-learning-transformers-and-the-consequences-of-scale-with-oriol-vinyals</link>
      <description>Today we’re excited to kick off our annual NeurIPS, joined by Oriol Vinyals, the lead of the deep learning team at Deepmind. We cover a lot of ground in our conversation with Oriol, beginning with a look at his research agenda and why the scope has remained wide even through the maturity of the field, his thoughts on transformer models and if they will get us beyond the current state of DL, or if some other model architecture would be more advantageous. We also touch on his thoughts on the large language models craze, before jumping into his recent paper StarCraft II Unplugged: Large Scale Offline Reinforcement Learning, a follow up to their popular AlphaStar work from a few years ago. Finally, we discuss the degree to which the work that Deepmind and others are doing around games actually translates into real-world, non-game scenarios, recent work on multimodal few-shot learning, and we close with a discussion of the consequences of the level of scale that we’ve achieved thus far.

      <title>Optimization, Machine Learning and Intelligent Experimentation with Michael McCourt - #545</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/optimization-machine-learning-and-intelligent-experimentation-with-michael-mccourt</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Michael McCourt the head of engineering at SigOpt. In our conversation with Michael, we explore the vast space around the topic of optimization, including the technical differences between ML and optimization and where they’re applied, what the path to increasing complexity looks like for a practitioner and the relationship between optimization and active learning. We also discuss the research frontier for optimization and how folks think about the interesting challenges and open questions for this field, how optimization approaches appeared at the latest NeurIPS conference, and Mike’s excitement for the emergence of interdisciplinary work between the machine learning community and other fields like the natural sciences.

      <title>Jupyter and the Evolution of ML Tooling with Brian Granger - #544</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/jupyter-and-the-evolution-of-ml-tooling-with-brian-granger</link>
      <description>Today we conclude our AWS re:Invent coverage joined by Brian Granger, a senior principal technologist at Amazon Web Services, and a co-creator of Project Jupyter. In our conversion with Brian, we discuss the inception and early vision of Project Jupyter, including how the explosion of machine learning and deep learning shifted the landscape for the notebook, and how they balanced the needs of these new user bases vs their existing community of scientific computing users. We also explore AWS’s role with Jupyter and why they’ve decided to invest resources in the project, Brian's thoughts on the broader ML tooling space, and how they’ve applied (and the impact of) HCI principles to the building of these tools. Finally, we dig into the recent Sagemaker Canvas and Studio Lab releases and Brian’s perspective on the future of notebooks and the Jupyter community at large.

      <title>re:Invent Roundup 2021 with Bratin Saha - #542</title>
      <link>http://twimlai.com/reinvent-roundup-2021-with-bratin-saha</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Bratin Saha, vice president and general manager at Amazon.
In our conversation with Bratin, we discuss quite a few of the recent ML-focused announcements coming out of last weeks re:Invent conference, including new products like Canvas and Studio Lab, as well as upgrades to existing services like Ground Truth Plus. We explore what no-code environments like the aforementioned Canvas mean for the democratization of ML tooling, and some of the key challenges to delivering it as a consumable product. We also discuss industrialization as a subset of MLOps, and how customer patterns inform the creation of these tools, and much more!

      <title>Multi-modal Deep Learning for Complex Document Understanding with Doug Burdick - #541</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/multi-modal-deep-learning-for-complex-document-understanding-with-doug-burdick</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Doug Burdick, a principal research staff member at IBM Research. In a recent interview, Doug’s colleague Yunyao Li joined us to talk through some of the broader enterprise NLP problems she’s working on. One of those problems is making documents machine consumable, especially with the traditionally archival file type, the PDF. That’s where Doug and his team come in.
In our conversation, we discuss the multimodal approach they’ve taken to identify, interpret, contextualize and extract things like tables from a document, the challenges they’ve faced when dealing with the tables and how they evaluate the performance of models on tables. We also explore how he’s handled generalizing across different formats, how fine-tuning has to be in order to be effective, the problems that appear on the NLP side of things, and how deep learning models are being leveraged within the group.

      <title>Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Learning and Reliability Engineering with Shayan Mortazavi - #540</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/predictive-maintenance-using-deep-learning-and-reliability-engineering-with-shayan-mortazavi</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Shayan Mortazavi, a data science manager at Accenture. 
In our conversation with Shayan, we discuss his talk from the recent SigOpt HPC &amp; AI Summit, titled A Novel Framework Predictive Maintenance Using Dl and Reliability Engineering. In the talk, Shayan proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for prognosis prediction of oil and gas plant equipment in an effort to prevent critical damage or failure. We explore the evolution of reliability engineering, the decision to use a residual-based approach rather than traditional anomaly detection to determine when an anomaly was happening, the challenges of using LSTMs when building these models, the amount of human labeling required to build the models, and much more!

      <link>https://twimlai.com/building-a-deep-tech-startup-in-nlp-with-nasrin-mostafazadeh</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by friend-of-the-show Nasrin Mostafazadeh, co-founder of Verneek. 
Though Verneek is still in stealth, Nasrin was gracious enough to share a bit about the company, including their goal of enabling anyone to make data-informed decisions without the need for a technical background, through the use of innovative human-machine interfaces. In our conversation, we explore the state of AI research in the domains relevant to the problem they’re trying to solve and how they use those insights to inform and prioritize their research agenda. We also discuss what advice Nasrin would give to someone thinking about starting a deep tech startup or going from research to product development.

      <title>Models for Human-Robot Collaboration with Julie Shah - #538</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/models-for-human-robot-collaboration-with-julie-shah</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Julie Shah, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Julie’s work lies at the intersection of aeronautics, astronautics, and robotics, with a specific focus on collaborative and interactive robotics. In our conversation, we explore how robots would achieve the ability to predict what their human collaborators are thinking, what the process of building knowledge into these systems looks like, and her big picture idea of developing a field robot that doesn’t “require a human to be a robot” to work with it. We also discuss work Julie has done on cross-training between humans and robots with the focus on getting them to co-learn how to work together, as well as future projects that she’s excited about.

      <title>Four Key Tools for Robust Enterprise NLP with Yunyao Li - #537</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/four-key-tools-for-robust-enterprise-nlp-with-yunyao-li</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Yunyao Li, a senior research manager at IBM Research. 
Yunyao is in a somewhat unique position at IBM, addressing the challenges of enterprise NLP in a traditional research environment, while also having customer engagement responsibilities. In our conversation with Yunyao, we explore the challenges associated with productizing NLP in the enterprise, and if she focuses on solving these problems independent of one another, or through a more unified approach. 
We then ground the conversation with real-world examples of these enterprise challenges, including enabling level document discovery at scale using combinations of techniques like deep neural networks and supervised and/or unsupervised learning, and entity extraction and semantic parsing to identify text. Finally, we talk through data augmentation in the context of NLP, and how we enable the humans in-the-loop to generate high-quality data.

      <title>Machine Learning at GSK with Kim Branson - #536</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/machine-learning-at-gsk-with-kim-branson</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Kim Branson, the SVP and global head of artificial intelligence and machine learning at GSK. 
We cover a lot of ground in our conversation, starting with a breakdown of GSK’s core pharmaceutical business, and how ML/AI fits into that equation, use cases that appear using genetics data as a data source, including sequential learning for drug discovery. We also explore the 500 billion node knowledge graph Kim’s team built to mine scientific literature, and their “AI Hub”, the ML/AI infrastructure team that handles all tooling and engineering problems within their organization. Finally, we explore their recent cancer research collaboration with King’s College, which is tasked with understanding the individualized needs of high- and low-risk cancer patients using ML/AI amongst other technologies.

      <title>The Benefit of Bottlenecks in Evolving Artificial Intelligence with David Ha - #535</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/the-benefit-of-bottlenecks-in-evolving-artificial-intelligence-with-david-ha</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by David Ha, a research scientist at Google. 
In nature, there are many examples of “bottlenecks”, or constraints, that have shaped our development as a species. Building upon this idea, David posits that these same evolutionary bottlenecks could work when training neural network models as well. In our conversation with David, we cover a TON of ground, including the aforementioned biological inspiration for his work, then digging deeper into the different types of constraints he’s applied to ML systems. We explore abstract generative models and how advanced training agents inside of generative models has become, and quite a few papers including Neuroevolution of self-interpretable agents, World Models and Attention for Reinforcement Learning, and The Sensory Neuron as a Transformer: Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning.
This interview is Nerd Alert certified, so get your notes ready! 
PS. David is one of our favorite follows on Twitter (@hardmaru), so check him out and share your thoughts on this interview and his work!

      <title>Facebook Abandons Facial Recognition. Should Everyone Else Follow Suit? With Luke Stark - #534</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/facebook-abandons-facial-recognition-should-everyone-else-follow-suit-with-luke-stark</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Luke Stark, an assistant professor at Western University in London, Ontario. 
In our conversation with Luke, we explore the existence and use of facial recognition technology, something Luke has been critical of in his work over the past few years, comparing it to plutonium. We discuss Luke’s recent paper, “Physiognomic Artificial Intelligence”, in which he critiques studies that will attempt to use faces and facial expressions and features to make determinations about people, a practice fundamental to facial recognition, also one that Luke believes is inherently racist at its core. 
Finally, briefly discuss the recent wave of hires at the FTC, and the news that broke (mid-recording) announcing that Facebook will be shutting down their facial recognition system and why it's not necessarily the game-changing announcement it seemed on its… face.

      <title>Building Blocks of Machine Learning at LEGO with Francesc Joan Riera - #533</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/building-blocks-of-machine-learning-at-lego-with-francesc-joan-riera</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Francesc Joan Riera, an applied machine learning engineer at The LEGO Group. 

In our conversation, we explore the ML infrastructure at LEGO, specifically around two use cases, content moderation and user engagement. While content moderation is not a new or novel task, but because their apps and products are marketed towards children, their need for heightened levels of moderation makes it very interesting. 

We discuss if the moderation system is built specifically to weed out bad actors or passive behaviors if their system has a human-in-the-loop component, why they built a feature store as opposed to a traditional database, and challenges they faced along that journey. We also talk through the range of skill sets on their team, the use of MLflow for experimentation, the adoption of AWS for serverless, and so much more!

      <title>Exploring the FastAI Tooling Ecosystem with Hamel Husain - #532</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/exploring-the-fastai-tooling-ecosystem-with-hamel-husain</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Hamel Husain, Staff Machine Learning Engineer at GitHub. 
Over the last few years, Hamel has had the opportunity to work on some of the most popular open source projects in the ML world, including fast.ai, nbdev, fastpages, and fastcore, just to name a few. In our conversation with Hamel, we discuss his journey into Silicon Valley, and how he discovered that the ML tooling and infrastructure weren’t quite as advanced as he’d assumed, and how that led him to help build some of the foundational pieces of Airbnb’s Bighead Platform. 
We also spend time exploring Hamel’s time working with Jeremy Howard and the team creating fast.ai, how nbdev came about, and how it plans to change the way practitioners interact with traditional jupyter notebooks. Finally, talk through a few more tools in the fast.ai ecosystem, fastpages, fastcore, how these tools interact with Github Actions, and the up and coming ML tools that Hamel is excited about.

      <itunes:summary>Today we’re joined by Hamel Husain, Staff Machine Learning Engineer at GitHub. 
Over the last few years, Hamel has had the opportunity to work on some of the most popular open source projects in the ML world, including fast.ai, nbdev, fastpages, and fastcore, just to name a few. In our conversation with Hamel, we discuss his journey into Silicon Valley, and how he discovered that the ML tooling and infrastructure weren’t quite as advanced as he’d assumed, and how that led him to help build some of the foundational pieces of Airbnb’s Bighead Platform. 
We also spend time exploring Hamel’s time working with Jeremy Howard and the team creating fast.ai, how nbdev came about, and how it plans to change the way practitioners interact with traditional jupyter notebooks. Finally, talk through a few more tools in the fast.ai ecosystem, fastpages, fastcore, how these tools interact with Github Actions, and the up and coming ML tools that Hamel is excited about.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/multi-task-learning-for-melanoma-detection-with-julianna-ianni</link>
      <description>In today’s episode, we are joined by Julianna Ianni, vice president of AI research &amp; development at Proscia.

In our conversation, Julianna shares her and her team’s research focused on developing applications that would help make the life of pathologists easier by enabling tasks to quickly and accurately be diagnosed using deep learning and AI.

We also explore their paper “A Pathology Deep Learning System Capable of Triage of Melanoma Specimens Utilizing Dermatopathologist Consensus as Ground Truth”, while talking through how ML aids pathologists in diagnosing Melanoma by building a multitask classifier to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk cases. Finally, we discussed the challenges involved in designing a model that would help in identifying and classifying Melanoma, the results they’ve achieved, and what the future of this work could look like.

      <title>Advancing Deep Reinforcement Learning with NetHack, w/ Tim Rocktäschel - #527</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/advancing-deep-reinforcement-learning-with-nethack-w-tim-rocktaschel</link>
      <description>Take our survey at twimlai.com/survey21!

Today we’re joined by Tim Rocktäschel, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research and an associate professor at University College London (UCL). 

Tim’s work focuses on training RL agents in simulated environments, with the goal of these agents being able to generalize to novel situations. Typically, this is done in environments like OpenAI Gym, MuJuCo, or even using Atari games, but these all come with constraints. In Tim’s approach, he utilizes a game called NetHack, which is much more rich and complex than the aforementioned environments.  

In our conversation with Tim, we explore the ins and outs of using NetHack as a training environment, including how much control a user has when generating each individual game and the challenges he's faced when deploying the agents. We also discuss his work on MiniHack, an environment creation framework and suite of tasks that are based on NetHack, and future directions for this research.

      <title>Deep Learning is Eating 5G. Here’s How, w/ Joseph Soriaga - #525</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/deep-learning-is-eating-5g-heres-how-w-joseph-soriaga</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Joseph Soriaga, a senior director of technology at Qualcomm. 

In our conversation with Joseph, we focus on a pair of papers that he and his team will be presenting at Globecom later this year. The first, Neural Augmentation of Kalman Filter with Hypernetwork for Channel Tracking, details the use of deep learning to augment an algorithm to address mismatches in models, allowing for more efficient training and making models more interpretable and predictable. The second paper, WiCluster: Passive Indoor 2D/3D Positioning using WiFi without Precise Labels, explores the use of rf signals to infer what the environment looks like, allowing for estimation of a person’s movement. 

We also discuss the ability for machine learning and AI to help enable 5G and make it more efficient for these applications, as well as the scenarios that ML would allow for more effective delivery of connected services, and look towards what might be possible in the near future.

      <title>Modeling Human Cognition with RNNs and Curriculum Learning, w/ Kanaka Rajan - #524</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/modeling-memory-with-rnns-and-curriculum-learning-w-kanaka-rajan</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Kanaka Rajan, an assistant professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai. Kanaka, who is a recent recipient of the NSF Career Award, bridges the gap between the worlds of biology and artificial intelligence with her work in computer science. In our conversation, we explore how she builds “lego models” of the brain that mimic biological brain functions, then reverse engineers those models to answer the question “do these follow the same operating principles that the biological brain uses?”

We also discuss the relationship between memory and dynamically evolving system states, how close we are to understanding how memory actually works, how she uses RNNs for modeling these processes, and what training and data collection looks like. Finally, we touch on her use of curriculum learning (where the task you want a system to learn increases in complexity slowly), and of course, we look ahead at future directions for Kanaka’s research.

      <title>Do You Dare Run Your ML Experiments in Production? with Ville Tuulos - #523</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/do-you-dare-run-your-ml-experiments-in-production-with-ville-tuulos</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by a friend of the show and return guest Ville Tuulos, CEO and co-founder of Outerbounds. In our previous conversations with Ville, we explored his experience building and deploying the open-source framework, Metaflow, while working at Netflix. Since our last chat, Ville has embarked on a few new journeys, including writing the upcoming book Effective Data Science Infrastructure, and commercializing Metaflow, both of which we dig into quite a bit in this conversation. 

We reintroduce the problem that Metaflow was built to solve and discuss some of the unique use cases that Ville has seen since it's release, the relationship between Metaflow and Kubernetes, and the maturity of services like batch and lambdas allowing a complete production ML system to be delivered. Finally, we discuss the degree to which Ville is catering is Outerbounds’ efforts to building tools for the MLOps community, and what the future looks like for him and Metaflow.

      <title>Delivering Neural Speech Services at Scale with Li Jiang - #522</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/delivering-neural-speech-services-at-scale-with-li-jiang</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Li Jiang, a distinguished engineer at Microsoft working on Azure Speech. 

In our conversation with Li, we discuss his journey across 27 years at Microsoft, where he’s worked on, among other things, audio and speech recognition technologies. We explore his thoughts on the advancements in speech recognition over the past few years, the challenges, and advantages, of using either end-to-end or hybrid models. 

We also discuss the trade-offs between delivering accuracy or quality and the kind of runtime characteristics that you require as a service provider, in the context of engineering and delivering a service at the scale of Azure Speech. Finally, we walk through the data collection process for customizing a voice for TTS, what languages are currently supported, managing the responsibilities of threats like deep fakes, the future for services like these, and much more!

      <title>AI’s Legal and Ethical Implications with Sandra Wachter - #521</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ais-legal-and-ethical-implications-with-sandra-wachter</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sandra Wacther, an associate professor and senior research fellow at the University of Oxford. 

Sandra’s work lies at the intersection of law and AI, focused on what she likes to call “algorithmic accountability”. In our conversation, we explore algorithmic accountability in three segments, explainability/transparency, data protection, and bias, fairness and discrimination. We discuss how the thinking around black boxes changes when discussing applying regulation and law, as well as a breakdown of counterfactual explanations and how they’re created. We also explore why factors like the lack of oversight lead to poor self-regulation, and the conditional demographic disparity test that she helped develop to test bias in models, which was recently adopted by Amazon.

      <title>Compositional ML and the Future of Software Development with Dillon Erb - #520</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/compositional-ml-and-the-future-of-software-development-with-dillon-erb</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Dillon Erb, CEO of Paperspace. 

If you’re not familiar with Dillon, he joined us about a year ago to discuss Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Discipline; we strongly encourage you to check out that interview as well. In our conversation, we explore the idea of compositional AI, and if it is the next frontier in a string of recent game-changing machine learning developments. We also discuss a source of constant back and forth in the community around the role of notebooks, and why Paperspace made the choice to pivot towards a more traditional engineering code artifact model after building a popular notebook service. Finally, we talk through their newest release Workflows, an automation and build system for ML applications, which Dillon calls their “most ambitious and comprehensive project yet.”

      <title>Generating SQL Database Queries from Natural Language with Yanshuai Cao - #519</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/generating-sql-database-queries-from-natural-language-with-yanshuai-cao</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Yanshuai Cao, a senior research team lead at Borealis AI. In our conversation with Yanshuai, we explore his work on Turing, their natural language to SQL engine that allows users to get insights from relational databases without having to write code. We do a bit of compare and contrast with the recently released Codex Model from OpenAI, the role that reasoning plays in solving this problem, and how it is implemented in the model. We also talk through various challenges like data augmentation, the complexity of the queries that Turing can produce, and a paper that explores the explainability of this model.

      <title>Social Commonsense Reasoning with Yejin Choi - #518</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/social-commonsense-reasoning-with-yejin-choi</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Yejin Choi, a professor at the University of Washington. We had the pleasure of catching up with Yejin after her keynote interview at the recent Stanford HAI “Foundational Models” workshop. In our conversation, we explore her work at the intersection of natural language generation and common sense reasoning, including how she defines common sense, and what the current state of the world is for that research. We discuss how this could be used for creative storytelling, how transformers could be applied to these tasks, and we dig into the subfields of physical and social common sense reasoning. Finally, we talk through the future of Yejin’s research and the areas that she sees as most promising going forward.

      <title>Exploring AI 2041 with Kai-Fu Lee - #516</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/exploring-ai-2041-with-kai-fu-lee</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Kai-Fu Lee, chairman and CEO of Sinovation Ventures and author of AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future. 

In AI 2041, Kai-Fu and co-author Chen Qiufan tell the story of how AI could shape our future through a series of 10 “scientific fiction” short stories. In our conversation with Kai-Fu, we explore why he chose 20 years as the time horizon for these stories, and dig into a few of the stories in more detail. We explore the potential for level 5 autonomous driving and what effect that will have on both established and developing nations, the potential outcomes when dealing with job displacement, and his perspective on how the book will be received. We also discuss the potential consequences of autonomous weapons, if we should actually worry about singularity or superintelligence, and the evolution of regulations around AI in 20 years.

We’d love to hear from you! What are your thoughts on any of the stories we discuss in the interview? Will you be checking this book out? Let us know in the comments on the show notes page at twimlai.com/go/516.</description>

      <title>Using Brain Imaging to Improve Neural Networks with Alona Fyshe - #513</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/using-brain-imaging-to-improve-neural-networks-with-alona-fyshe</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Alona Fyshe, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta. 

We caught up with Alona on the heels of an interesting panel discussion that she participated in, centered around improving AI systems using research about brain activity. In our conversation, we explore the multiple types of brain images that are used in this research, what representations look like in these images, and how we can improve language models without knowing explicitly how the brain understands the language. We also discuss similar experiments that have incorporated vision, the relationship between computer vision models and the representations that language models create, and future projects like applying a reinforcement learning framework to improve language generation.

      <title>A Social Scientist’s Perspective on AI with Eric Rice - #511</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/a-social-scientists-perspective-on-ai-with-eric-rice</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Eric Rice, associate professor at USC, and the co-director of the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society. 

Eric is a sociologist by trade, and in our conversation, we explore how he has made extensive inroads within the machine learning community through collaborations with ML academics and researchers. We discuss some of the most important lessons Eric has learned while doing interdisciplinary projects, how the social scientist’s approach to assessment and measurement would be different from a computer scientist's approach to assessing the algorithmic performance of a model. 

We specifically explore a few projects he’s worked on including HIV prevention amongst the homeless youth population in LA, a project he spearheaded with former guest Milind Tambe, as well as a project focused on using ML techniques to assist in the identification of people in need of housing resources, and ensuring that they get the best interventions possible. 

If you enjoyed this conversation, I encourage you to check out our conversation with Milind Tambe from last year’s TWIMLfest on Why AI Innovation and Social Impact Go Hand in Hand.

      <description>Today we’re joined by José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, a university lecturer in machine learning at the University of Cambridge. In our conversation with Miguel, we explore his work at the intersection of Bayesian learning and deep learning. We discuss how he’s been applying this to the field of molecular design and discovery via two different methods, with one paper searching for possible chemical reactions, and the other doing the same, but in 3D and in 3D space. We also discuss the challenges of sample efficiency, creating objective functions, and how those manifest themselves in these experiments, and how he integrated the Bayesian approach to RL problems. We also talk through a handful of other papers that Miguel has presented at recent conferences, which are all linked at twimlai.com/go/510.</description>

      <title>Codex, OpenAI’s Automated Code Generation API with Greg Brockman - #509</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/codex-openais-automated-code-generation-api-with-greg-brockman</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by return guest Greg Brockman, co-founder and CTO of OpenAI. We had the pleasure of reconnecting with Greg on the heels of the announcement of Codex, OpenAI’s most recent release. Codex is a direct descendant of GPT-3 that allows users to do autocomplete tasks based on all of the publicly available text and code on the internet. In our conversation with Greg, we explore the distinct results Codex sees in comparison to GPT-3, relative to the prompts it's being given, how it could evolve given different types of training data, and how users and practitioners should think about interacting with the API to get the most out of it. We also discuss Copilot, their recent collaboration with Github that is built on Codex, as well as the implications of Codex on coding education, explainability, and broader societal issues like fairness and bias, copyrighting, and jobs.

      <title>Spatiotemporal Data Analysis with Rose Yu - #508</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/spatiotemporal-data-analysis-with-rose-yu</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Rose Yu, an assistant professor at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. 

Rose’s research focuses on advancing machine learning algorithms and methods for analyzing large-scale time-series and spatial-temporal data, then applying those developments to climate, transportation, and other physical sciences. We discuss how Rose incorporates physical knowledge and partial differential equations in these use cases and how symmetries are being exploited. We also explore their novel neural network design that is focused on non-traditional convolution operators and allows for general symmetry, how we get from these representations to the network architectures that she has developed and another recent paper on deep spatio-temporal models.

      <title>Parallelism and Acceleration for Large Language Models with Bryan Catanzaro - #507</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/parallelism-and-acceleration-for-large-language-models-with-bryan-catanzaro</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA.

Most folks know Bryan as one of the founders/creators of cuDNN, the accelerated library for deep neural networks. In our conversation, we explore his interest in high-performance computing and its recent overlap with AI, his current work on Megatron, a framework for training giant language models, and the basic approach for distributing a large language model on DGX infrastructure. 
We also discuss the three different kinds of parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism, that Megatron provides when training models, as well as his work on the Deep Learning Super Sampling project and the role it's playing in the present and future of game development via ray tracing.

      <title>Applying the Causal Roadmap to Optimal Dynamic Treatment Rules with Lina Montoya - #506</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/applying-the-causal-roadmap-to-optimal-dynamic-treatment-rules-with-lina-montoya</link>
      <description>Today we close out our 2021 ICML series joined by Lina Montoya, a postdoctoral researcher at UNC Chapel Hill. 
In our conversation with Lina, who was an invited speaker at the Neglected Assumptions in Causal Inference Workshop, we explored her work applying Optimal Dynamic Treatment (ODT) to understand which kinds of individuals respond best to specific interventions in the US criminal justice system. We discuss the concept of neglected assumptions and how it connects to ODT rule estimation, as well as a breakdown of the causal roadmap, coined by researchers at UC Berkeley. 
Finally, Lina talks us through the roadmap while applying the ODT rule problem, how she’s applied a “superlearner” algorithm to this problem, how it was trained, and what the future of this research looks like.

      <title>Constraint Active Search for Human-in-the-Loop Optimization with Gustavo Malkomes - #505</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/constraint-active-search-for-human-in-the-loop-optimization-with-gustavo-malkomes</link>
      <description>Today we continue our ICML series joined by Gustavo Malkomes, a research engineer at Intel via their recent acquisition of SigOpt. 
In our conversation with Gustavo, we explore his paper  Beyond the Pareto Efficient Frontier: Constraint Active Search for Multiobjective Experimental Design, which focuses on a novel algorithmic solution for the iterative model search process. This new algorithm empowers teams to run experiments where they are not optimizing particular metrics but instead identifying parameter configurations that satisfy constraints in the metric space. This allows users to efficiently explore multiple metrics at once in an efficient, informed, and intelligent way that lends itself to real-world, human-in-the-loop scenarios.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/fairness-and-robustness-in-federated-learning-with-virginia-smith</link>
      <description>Today we kick off our ICML coverage joined by Virginia Smith, an assistant professor in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. 
In our conversation with Virginia, we explore her work on cross-device federated learning applications, including where the distributed learning aspects of FL are relative to the privacy techniques. We dig into her paper from ICML, Ditto: Fair and Robust Federated Learning Through Personalization, what fairness means in contrast to AI ethics, the particulars of the failure modes, the relationship between models, and the things being optimized across devices, and the tradeoffs between fairness and robustness.
We also discuss a second paper, Heterogeneity for the Win: One-Shot Federated Clustering, how the proposed method makes heterogeneity beneficial in data, how the heterogeneity of data is classified, and some applications of FL in an unsupervised setting.

      <title>ML Innovation in Healthcare with Suchi Saria - #501</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ml-innovation-in-healthcare-with-suchi-saria</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Suchi Saria, the founder and CEO of Bayesian Health, the John C. Malone associate professor of computer science, statistics, and health policy, and the director of the machine learning and healthcare lab at Johns Hopkins University. 
Suchi shares a bit about her journey to working in the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, and how her research has spanned across both medical policy and discovery. We discuss why it has taken so long for machine learning to become accepted and adopted by the healthcare infrastructure and where exactly we stand in the adoption process, where there have been “pockets” of tangible success. 
Finally, we explore the state of healthcare data, and of course, we talk about Suchi’s recently announced startup Bayesian Health and their goals in the healthcare space, and an accompanying study that looks at real-time ML inference in an EMR setting.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/cross-device-ai-acceleration-compilation-execution-with-jeff-gehlhaar</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by a friend of the show Jeff Gehlhaar, VP of technology and the head of AI software platforms at Qualcomm. 
In our conversation with Jeff, we cover a ton of ground, starting with a bit of exploration around ML compilers, what they are, and their role in solving issues of parallelism. We also dig into the latest additions to the Snapdragon platform, AI Engine Direct, and how it works as a bridge to bring more capabilities across their platform, how benchmarking works in the context of the platform, how the work of other researchers we’ve spoken to on compression and quantization finds its way from research to product, and much more! 
After you check out this interview, you can look below for some of the other conversations with researchers mentioned.

      <title>The Future of Human-Machine Interaction with Dan Bohus and Siddhartha Sen - #499</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/the-future-of-human-machine-interaction-with-dan-bohus-and-siddhartha-sen</link>
      <description>Today we continue our AI in Innovation series joined by Dan Bohus, senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research, and Siddhartha Sen, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research. 
In this conversation, we use a pair of research projects, Maia Chess and Situated Interaction, to springboard us into a conversation about the evolution of human-AI interaction. We discuss both of these projects individually, as well as the commonalities they have, how themes like understanding the human experience appear in their work, the types of models being used, the various types of data, and the complexity of each of their setups. 
We explore some of the challenges associated with getting computers to better understand human behavior and interact in ways that are more fluid. Finally, we touch on what excites both Dan and Sid about their respective projects, and what they’re excited about for the future.

      <title>Vector Quantization for NN Compression with Julieta Martinez - #498</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/vector-quantization-for-nn-compression-with-julieta-martinez</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Julieta Martinez, a senior research scientist at recently announced startup Waabi. 
Julieta was a keynote speaker at the recent LatinX in AI workshop at CVPR, and our conversation focuses on her talk “What do Large-Scale Visual Search and Neural Network Compression have in Common,” which shows that multiple ideas from large-scale visual search can be used to achieve state-of-the-art neural network compression. We explore the commonality between large databases and dealing with high dimensional, many-parameter neural networks, the advantages of using product quantization, and how that plays out when using it to compress a neural network. 
We also dig into another paper Julieta presented at the conference, Deep Multi-Task Learning for Joint Localization, Perception, and Prediction, which details an architecture that is able to reuse computation between the three tasks, and is thus able to correct localization errors efficiently.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/advancing-nlp-with-project-debater-w-noam-slonim</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Noam Slonim, the principal investigator of Project Debater at IBM Research. 
In our conversation with Noam, we explore the history of Project Debater, the first AI system that can “debate” humans on complex topics. We also dig into the evolution of the project, which is the culmination of 7 years and over 50 research papers, and eventually becoming a Nature cover paper, “An Autonomous Debating System,” which details the system in its entirety. 
Finally, Noam details many of the underlying capabilities of Debater, including the relationship between systems preparation and training, evidence detection, detecting the quality of arguments, narrative generation, the use of conventional NLP methods like entity linking, and much more.

      <description>Today we’re joined by Nir Bar-Lev, co-founder and CEO of ClearML.

In our conversation with Nir, we explore how his view of the wide vs deep machine learning platforms paradox has changed and evolved over time, how companies should think about building vs buying and integration, and his thoughts on why experiment management has become an automatic buy, be it open source or otherwise. 
We also discuss the disadvantages of using a cloud vendor as opposed to a software-based approach, the balance between mlops and data science when addressing issues of overfitting, and how ClearML is applying techniques like federated machine learning and transfer learning to their solutions.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/applied-ai-research-at-aws-with-alex-smola</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Alex Smola, Vice President and Distinguished Scientist at AWS AI.
We had the pleasure to catch up with Alex prior to the upcoming AWS Machine Learning Summit, and we covered a TON of ground in the conversation. We start by focusing on his research in the domain of deep learning on graphs, including a few examples showcasing its function, and an interesting discussion around the relationship between large language models and graphs. Next up, we discuss their focus on AutoML research and how it's the key to lowering the barrier of entry for machine learning research.
Alex also shares a bit about his work on causality and causal modeling, introducing us to the concept of Granger causality. Finally, we talk about the aforementioned ML Summit, its exponential growth since its inception a few years ago, and what speakers he's most excited about hearing from.

      <title>Causal Models in Practice at Lyft with Sean Taylor - #486</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/causal-models-in-practice-at-lyft-with-sean-taylor</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sean Taylor, Staff Data Scientist at Lyft Rideshare Labs.
We cover a lot of ground with Sean, starting with his recent decision to step away from his previous role as the lab director to take a more hands-on role, and what inspired that change. We also discuss his research at Rideshare Labs, where they take a more “moonshot” approach to solving the typical problems like forecasting and planning, marketplace experimentation, and decision making, and how his statistical approach manifests itself in his work.
Finally, we spend quite a bit of time exploring the role of causality in the work at rideshare labs, including how systems like the aforementioned forecasting system are designed around causal models, if driving model development is more effective using business metrics, challenges associated with hierarchical modeling, and much much more.

      <title>Using AI to Map the Human Immune System w/ Jabran Zahid - #485</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/using-ai-to-map-the-human-immune-system-w-jabran-zahid</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jabran Zahid, a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research.
In our conversation with Jabran, we explore their recent endeavor into the complete mapping of which T-cells bind to which antigens through the Antigen Map Project. We discuss how Jabran’s background in astrophysics and cosmology has translated to his current work in immunology and biology, the origins of the antigen map, the biological and how the focus was changed by the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic.
We talk through the biological advancements, and the challenges of using machine learning in this setting, some of the more advanced ML techniques that they’ve tried that have not panned out (as of yet), the path forward for the antigen map to make a broader impact, and much more.

      <title>What the Human Brain Can Tell Us About NLP Models with Allyson Ettinger - #483</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/what-the-human-brain-can-tell-us-about-nlp-models-with-allyson-ettinger</link>
      <description>Today we continue our ICLR ‘21 series joined by Allyson Ettinger, an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago. 
One of our favorite recurring conversations on the podcast is the two-way street that lies between machine learning and neuroscience, which Allyson explores through the modeling of cognitive processes that pertain to language. In our conversation, we discuss how she approaches assessing the competencies of AI, the value of control of confounding variables in AI research, and how the pattern matching traits of Ml/DL models are not necessarily exclusive to these systems. 
Allyson also participated in a recent panel discussion at the ICLR workshop How Can Findings About The Brain Improve AI Systems?, centered around the utility of brain inspiration for developing AI models. We discuss ways in which we can try to more closely simulate the functioning of a brain, where her work fits into the analysis and interpretability area of NLP, and much more!

      <link>https://twimlai.com/building-a-unified-nlp-framework-at-linkedin-with-huiji-gao</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Huiji Gao, a Senior Engineering Manager of Machine Learning and AI at LinkedIn. 
In our conversation with Huiji, we dig into his interest in building NLP tools and systems, including a recent open-source project called DeText, a framework for generating models for ranking classification and language generation. We explore the motivation behind DeText, the landscape at LinkedIn before and after it was put into use broadly, and the various contexts it’s being used in at the company. We also discuss the relationship between BERT and DeText via LiBERT, a version of BERT that is trained and calibrated on LinkedIn data, the practical use of these tools from an engineering perspective, the approach they’ve taken to optimization, and much more!

      <title>Dask + Data Science Careers with Jacqueline Nolis - #480</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/dask-data-science-careers-with-jacqueline-nolis</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jacqueline Nolis, Head of Data Science at Saturn Cloud, and co-host of the Build a Career in Data Science Podcast. 
 You might remember Jacqueline from our Advancing Your Data Science Career During the Pandemic panel, where she shared her experience trying to navigate the suddenly hectic data science job market. Now, a year removed from that panel, we explore her book on data science careers, top insights for folks just getting into the field, ways that job seekers should be signaling that they have the required background, and how to approach and navigate failure as a data scientist. 
 We also spend quite a bit of time discussing Dask, an open-source library for parallel computing in Python, as well as use cases for the tool, the relationship between dask and Kubernetes and docker containers, where data scientists are in regards to the software development toolchain and much more!

      <title>AI Storytelling Systems with Mark Riedl - #478</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ai-storytelling-systems-with-mark-riedl</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Mark Riedl, a Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. In our conversation with Mark, we explore his work building AI storytelling systems, mainly those that try and predict what listeners think will happen next in a story and how he brings together many different threads of ML/AI together to solve these problems. We discuss how the theory of mind is layered into his research, the use of large language models like GPT-3, and his push towards being able to generate suspenseful stories with these systems. 
 We also discuss the concept of intentional creativity and the lack of good theory on the subject, the adjacent areas in ML that he’s most excited about for their potential contribution to his research, his recent focus on model explainability, how he approaches problems of common sense, and much more!

      <title>Creating Robust Language Representations with Jamie Macbeth - #477</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/creating-robust-language-representations-with-jamie-macbeth</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jamie Macbeth, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Smith College. 
 In our conversation with Jamie, we explore his work at the intersection of cognitive systems and natural language understanding, and how to use AI as a vehicle for better understanding human intelligence. We discuss the tie that binds these domains together, if the tasks are the same as traditional NLU tasks, and what are the specific things he’s trying to gain deeper insights into.
 One of the unique aspects of Jamie’s research is that he takes an “old-school AI” approach, and to that end, we discuss the models he handcrafts to generate language. Finally, we examine how he evaluates the performance of his representations if he’s not playing the SOTA “game,” what he bookmarks against, identifying deficiencies in deep learning systems, and the exciting directions for his upcoming research.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/reinforcement-learning-for-industrial-ai-with-pieter-abbeel</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Pieter Abbeel, a Professor at UC Berkeley, co-Director of the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR), as well as Co-founder and Chief Scientist at Covariant.
 In our conversation with Pieter, we cover a ton of ground, starting with the specific goals and tasks of his work at Covariant, the shift in needs for industrial AI application and robots, if his experience solving real-world problems has changed his opinion on end to end deep learning, and the scope for the three problem domains of the models he’s building.
 We also explore his recent work at the intersection of unsupervised and reinforcement learning, goal-directed RL, his recent paper “Pretrained Transformers as Universal Computation Engines” and where that research thread is headed, and of course, his new podcast Robot Brains, which you can find on all streaming platforms today!

      <title>Theory of Computation with Jelani Nelson - #473</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/theory-of-computation-with-jelani-nelson</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jelani Nelson, a professor in the Theory Group at UC Berkeley.
 In our conversation with Jelani, we explore his research in computational theory, where he focuses on building streaming and sketching algorithms, random projections, and dimensionality reduction. We discuss how Jelani thinks about the balance between the innovation of new algorithms and the performance of existing ones, and some use cases where we’d see his work in action.
 Finally, we talk through how his work ties into machine learning, what tools from the theorist’s toolbox he’d suggest all ML practitioners know, and his nonprofit AddisCoder, a 4 week summer program that introduces high-school students to programming and algorithms.

      <title>Human-Centered ML for High-Risk Behaviors with Stevie Chancellor - #472</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/human-centered-ml-for-high-risk-behaviors-with-stevie-chancellor</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Stevie Chancellor, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota.
 In our conversation with Stevie, we explore her work at the intersection of human-centered computing, machine learning, and high-risk mental illness behaviors. We discuss how her background in HCC helps shapes her perspective, how machine learning helps with understanding severity levels of mental illness, and some recent work where convolutional graph neural networks are applied to identify and discover new kinds of behaviors for people who struggle with opioid use disorder.
 We also explore the role of computational linguistics and NLP in her research, issues in using social media data being used as a data source, and finally, how people who are interested in an introduction to human-centered computing can get started.

      <title>Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜 with Emily Bender and Margaret Mitchell - #467</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/can-language-models-be-too-big-with-emily-bender-and-margaret-mitchell</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Emily M. Bender, Professor at the University of Washington, and AI Researcher, Margaret Mitchell. 
 Emily and Meg, as well as Timnit Gebru and Angelina McMillan-Major, are co-authors on the paper  On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜. As most of you undoubtedly know by now, there has been much controversy surrounding, and fallout from, this paper. In this conversation, our main priority was to focus on the message of the paper itself. We spend some time discussing the historical context for the paper, then turn to the goals of the paper, discussing the many reasons why the ever-growing datasets and models are not necessarily the direction we should be going. 
 We explore the cost of these training datasets, both literal and environmental, as well as the bias implications of these models, and of course the perpetual debate about responsibility when building and deploying ML systems. Finally, we discuss the thin line between AI hype and useful AI systems, and the importance of doing pre-mortems to truly flesh out any issues you could potentially come across prior to building models, and much much more.

      <title>Applying RL to Real-World Robotics with Abhishek Gupta - #466</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/applying-rl-to-real-world-robotics-with-abhishek-gupta</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Abhishek Gupta, a PhD Student at UC Berkeley. 
 Abhishek, a member of the BAIR Lab, joined us to talk about his recent robotics and reinforcement learning research and interests, which focus on applying RL to real-world robotics applications. We explore the concept of reward supervision, and how to get robots to learn these reward functions from videos, and the rationale behind supervised experts in these experiments. 
 We also discuss the use of simulation for experiments, data collection, and the path to scalable robotic learning. Finally, we discuss gradient surgery vs gradient sledgehammering, and his ecological RL paper, which focuses on the “phenomena that exist in the real world” and how humans and robotics systems interface in those situations.

      <itunes:summary>Today we’re joined by Abhishek Gupta, a PhD Student at UC Berkeley. 
 Abhishek, a member of the BAIR Lab, joined us to talk about his recent robotics and reinforcement learning research and interests, which focus on applying RL to real-world robotics applications. We explore the concept of reward supervision, and how to get robots to learn these reward functions from videos, and the rationale behind supervised experts in these experiments. 
 We also discuss the use of simulation for experiments, data collection, and the path to scalable robotic learning. Finally, we discuss gradient surgery vs gradient sledgehammering, and his ecological RL paper, which focuses on the “phenomena that exist in the real world” and how humans and robotics systems interface in those situations.

      <title>Accelerating Innovation with AI at Scale with David Carmona - #465</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/accelerating-innovation-with-ai-at-scale-with-david-carmona</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by David Carmona, General Manager of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Innovation at Microsoft. 
 In our conversation with David, we focus on his work on AI at Scale, an initiative focused on the change in the ways people are developing AI, driven in large part by the emergence of massive models. We explore David’s thoughts about the progression towards larger models, the focus on parameters and how it ties to the architecture of these models, and how we should assess how attention works in these models.
 We also discuss the different families of models (generation &amp; representation), the transition from CV to NLP tasks, and an interesting point of models “becoming a platform” via transfer learning.

      <title>Complexity and Intelligence with Melanie Mitchell - #464</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/complexity-and-intelligence-with-melanie-mitchell</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Melanie Mitchell, Davis Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and author of Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans. 
 While Melanie has had a long career with a myriad of research interests, we focus on a few, complex systems and the understanding of intelligence, complexity, and her recent work on getting AI systems to make analogies. We explore examples of social learning, and how it applies to AI contextually, and defining intelligence. 
 We discuss potential frameworks that would help machines understand analogies, established benchmarks for analogy, and if there is a social learning solution to help machines figure out analogy. Finally we talk through the overall state of AI systems, the progress we’ve made amid the limited concept of social learning, if we’re able to achieve intelligence with current approaches to AI, and much more!

      <title>Robust Visual Reasoning with Adriana Kovashka - #463</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/shortcut-effects-in-visual-commonsense-reasoning-with-adriana-kovashka</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Adriana Kovashka, an Assistant Professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
 In our conversation with Adriana, we explore her visual commonsense research, and how it intersects with her background in media studies. We discuss the idea of shortcuts, or faults in visual question answering data sets that appear in many SOTA results, as well as the concept of masking, a technique developed to assist in context prediction. Adriana then describes how these techniques fit into her broader goal of trying to understand the rhetoric of visual advertisements. 
 Finally, Adriana shares a bit about her work on robust visual reasoning, the parallels between this research and other work happening around explainability, and the vision for her work going forward.

      <title>Architectural and Organizational Patterns in Machine Learning with Nishan Subedi - #462</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/architectural-and-organizational-patterns-in-machine-learning-with-nishan-subedi</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Nishan Subedi, VP of Algorithms at Overstock.com.
 In our conversation with Nishan, we discuss his interesting path to MLOps and how ML/AI is used at Overstock, primarily for search/recommendations and marketing/advertisement use cases. We spend a great deal of time exploring machine learning architecture and architectural patterns, how he perceives the differences between architectural patterns and algorithms, and emergent architectural patterns that standards have not yet been set for.
 Finally, we discuss how the idea of anti-patterns was innovative in early design pattern thinking and if those concepts are transferable to ML, if architectural patterns will bleed over into organizational patterns and culture, and Nishan introduces us to the concept of Squads within an organizational structure.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/how-to-be-human-in-the-age-of-ai-with-ayanna-howard</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by returning guest and newly appointed Dean of the College of Engineering at The Ohio State University, Ayanna Howard. 
 Our conversation with Dr. Howard focuses on her recently released book, Sex, Race, and Robots: How to Be Human in the Age of AI, which is an extension of her research on the relationships between humans and robots. We continue to explore this relationship through the themes of socialization introduced in the book, like associating genders to AI and robotic systems and the “self-fulfilling prophecy” that has become search engines. 
 We also discuss a recurring conversation in the community around AI  being biased because of data versus models and data, and the choices and responsibilities that come with the ethical aspects of building AI systems. Finally, we discuss Dr. Howard’s new role at OSU, how it will affect her research, and what the future holds for the applied AI field.

      <title>How to Be Human in the Age of AI with Ayanna Howard - #460</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/how-to-be-human-in-the-age-of-ai-with-ayanna-howard</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by returning guest and newly appointed Dean of the College of Engineering at The Ohio State University, Ayanna Howard. 
 Our conversation with Dr. Howard focuses on her recently released book, Sex, Race, and Robots: How to Be Human in the Age of AI, which is an extension of her research on the relationships between humans and robots. We continue to explore this relationship through the themes of socialization introduced in the book, like associating genders to AI and robotic systems and the “self-fulfilling prophecy” that has become search engines. 
 We also discuss a recurring conversation in the community around AI  being biased because of data versus models and data, and the choices and responsibilities that come with the ethical aspects of building AI systems. Finally, we discuss Dr. Howard’s new role at OSU, how it will affect her research, and what the future holds for the applied AI field.

      <title>Towards a Systems-Level Approach to Fair ML with Sarah M. Brown - #456</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/towards-a-systems-level-approach-to-fair-ml-with-sarah-m-brown</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sarah Brown, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island.
 In our conversation with Sarah, whose research focuses on Fairness in AI, we discuss why a “systems-level” approach is necessary when thinking about ethical and fairness issues in models and algorithms. We also explore Wiggum: a fairness forensics tool, which explores bias and allows for regular auditing of data, as well as her ongoing collaboration with a social psychologist to explore how people perceive ethics and fairness.
 Finally, we talk through the role of tools in assessing fairness and bias, and the importance of understanding the decisions the tools are making.

      <title>AI for Digital Health Innovation with Andrew Trister - #455</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ai-for-digital-health-innovation-with-andrew-trister</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Andrew Trister, Deputy Director for Digital Health Innovation at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. 
 In our conversation with Andrew, we explore some of the AI use cases at the foundation, with the goal of bringing “community-based” healthcare to underserved populations in the global south. We focus on COVID-19 response and improving the accuracy of malaria testing with a bayesian framework and a few others, and the challenges like scaling these systems and building out infrastructure so that communities can begin to support themselves. 
 We also touch on Andrew's previous work at Apple, where he helped develop what is now known as Research Kit, their ML for health tools that are now seen in apple devices like phones and watches.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/system-design-for-autonomous-vehicles-with-drago-anguelov</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Drago Anguelov, Distinguished Scientist and Head of Research at Waymo. 
 In our conversation, we explore the state of the autonomous vehicles space broadly and at Waymo, including how AV has improved in the last few years, their focus on level 4 driving, and Drago’s thoughts on the direction of the industry going forward. Drago breaks down their core ML use cases, Perception, Prediction, Planning, and Simulation, and how their work has lead to a fully autonomous vehicle being deployed in Phoenix. 
 We also discuss the socioeconomic and environmental impact of self-driving cars, a few research papers submitted to NeurIPS 2020, and if the sophistication of AV systems will lend themselves to the development of tomorrow’s enterprise machine learning systems.

      <title>Building, Adopting, and Maturing LinkedIn's Machine Learning Platform with Ya Xu - #453</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/building-adopting-and-maturing-linkedins-machine-learning-platform-with-ya-xu</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Ya Xu, head of Data Science at LinkedIn, and TWIMLcon: AI Platforms 2021 Keynote Speaker.
 We cover a ton of ground with Ya, starting with her experiences prior to becoming Head of DS, as one of the architects of the LinkedIn Platform. We discuss her “three phases” (building, adoption, and maturation) to keep in mind when building out a platform, how to avoid “hero syndrome” early in the process.
 Finally, we dig into the various tools and platforms that give LinkedIn teams leverage, their organizational structure, as well as the emergence of differential privacy for security use cases and if it's ready for prime time.

      <title>Expressive Deep Learning with Magenta DDSP w/ Jesse Engel - #452</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/expressive-deep-learning-with-magenta-ddsp-w-jesse-engel</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jesse Engel, Staff Research Scientist at Google, working on the Magenta Project. 
 In our conversation with Jesse, we explore the current landscape of creativity AI, and the role Magenta plays in helping express creativity through ML and deep learning. We dig deep into their Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which “lets you combine the interpretable structure of classical DSP elements (such as filters, oscillators, reverberation, etc.) with the expressivity of deep learning.”
 Finally, Jesse walks us through some of the other projects that the Magenta team undertakes, including NLP and language modeling, and what he wants to see come out of the work that he and others are doing in creative AI research.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/semantic-folding-for-natural-language-understanding-with-francisco-weber</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by return guest Francisco Webber, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Cortical.io.
 Francisco was originally a guest over 4 years and 400 episodes ago, where we discussed his company Cortical.io, and their unique approach to natural language processing. In this conversation, Francisco gives us an update on Cortical, including their applications and toolkit, including semantic extraction, classifier, and search use cases. We also discuss GPT-3, and how it compares to semantic folding, the unreasonable amount of data needed to train these models, and the difference between the GPT approach and semantic modeling for language understanding.

      <title>The Future of Autonomous Systems with Gurdeep Pall - #450</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/the-future-of-autonomous-systems-with-gurdeep-pall</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Gurdeep Pall, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft.
 Gurdeep, who we had the pleasure of speaking with on his 31st anniversary at the company, has had a hand in creating quite a few influential projects, including Skype for business (and Teams) and being apart of the first team that shipped wifi as a part of a general-purpose operating system.
 In our conversation with Gurdeep, we discuss Microsoft’s acquisition of Bonsai and how they fit in the toolchain for creating brains for autonomous systems with “machine teaching,” and other practical applications of machine teaching in autonomous systems. We also explore the challenges of simulation, and how they’ve evolved to make the problems that the physical world brings more tenable. Finally, Gurdeep shares concrete use cases for autonomous systems, and how to get the best ROI on those investments, and of course, what’s next in the very broad space of autonomous systems.

      <title>AI for Ecology and Ecosystem Preservation with Bryan Carstens - #449</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ai-for-ecology-and-ecosystem-preservation</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Bryan Carstens, a professor in the Department of Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology &amp; Head of the Tetrapod Division in the Museum of Biological Diversity at The Ohio State University.
 In our conversation with Bryan, who comes from a traditional biology background, we cover a ton of ground, including a foundational layer of understanding for the vast known unknowns in species and biodiversity, and how he came to apply machine learning to his lab’s research.
 We explore a few of his lab’s projects, including applying ML to genetic data to understand the geographic and environmental structure of DNA, what factors keep machine learning from being used more frequently used in biology, and what’s next for his group.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/off-line-off-policy-rl-for-real-world-decision-making-at-facebook</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jason Gauci, a Software Engineering Manager at Facebook AI.
 In our conversation with Jason, we explore their Reinforcement Learning platform, Re-Agent (Horizon). We discuss the role of decision making and game theory in the platform and the types of decisions they’re using Re-Agent to make, from ranking and recommendations to their eCommerce marketplace.
 Jason also walks us through the differences between online/offline and on/off policy model training, and where Re-Agent sits in this spectrum. Finally, we discuss the concept of counterfactual causality, and how they ensure safety in the results of their models.

      <title>A Future of Work for the Invisible Workers in A.I. with Saiph Savage - #447</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/a-future-of-work-for-the-invisible-workers-in-a-i-with-saiph-savage</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Saiph Savage, a Visiting professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU, director of the HCI Lab at WVU, and co-director of the Civic Innovation Lab at UNAM.
 We caught up with Saiph during NeurIPS where she delivered an insightful invited talk “A Future of Work for the Invisible Workers in A.I.”. In our conversation with Saiph, we gain a better understanding of the “Invisible workers,” or the people doing the work of labeling for machine learning and AI systems, and some of the issues around lack of economic empowerment, emotional trauma, and other issues that arise with these jobs.
 We discuss ways that we can empower these workers, and push the companies that are employing these workers to do the same. Finally, we discuss Saiph’s participatory design work with rural workers in the global south.

In our conversation with Saiph, we gain a better understanding of the “Invisible workers,” or the people doing the work of labeling for machine learning and AI systems, and some of the issues around lack of economic empowerment, emotional trauma, and other issues that arise with these jobs.
 We discuss ways that we can empower these workers, and push the companies that are employing these workers to do the same. Finally, we discuss Saiph’s participatory design work with rural workers in the global south.

      <title>Trends in Graph Machine Learning with Michael Bronstein - #446</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/trends-in-graph-machine-learning-with-michael-bronstein</link>
      <description>Today we’re back with the final episode of AI Rewind joined by Michael Bronstein, a professor at Imperial College London and the Head of Graph Machine Learning at Twitter.
 In our conversation with Michael, we touch on his thoughts about the year in Machine Learning overall, including GPT-3 and Implicit Neural Representations, but spend a major chunk of time on the sub-field of Graph Machine Learning. 
 We talk through the application of Graph ML across domains like physics and bioinformatics, and the tools to look out for. Finally, we discuss what Michael thinks is in store for 2021, including graph ml applied to molecule discovery and non-human communication translation.</description>

      <title>Trends in Natural Language Processing with Sameer Singh - #445</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/trends-in-natural-language-processing-with-sameer-singh</link>
      <description>Today we continue the 2020 AI Rewind series, joined by friend of the show Sameer Singh, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at UC Irvine. 
 We last spoke with Sameer at our Natural Language Processing office hours back at TWIMLfest, and was the perfect person to help us break down 2020 in NLP. Sameer tackles the review in 4 main categories, Massive Language Modeling, Fundamental Problems with Language Models, Practical Vulnerabilities with Language Models, and Evaluation. 
 We also explore the impact of GPT-3 and Transformer models, the intersection of vision and language models, and the injection of causal thinking and modeling into language models, and much more.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/morel-model-based-offline-reinforcement-learning-with-aravind-rajeswaran</link>
      <description>Today we close out our NeurIPS series joined by Aravind Rajeswaran, a PhD Student in machine learning and robotics at the University of Washington.
 At NeurIPS, Aravind presented his paper MOReL: Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning. In our conversation, we explore model-based reinforcement learning, and if models are a “prerequisite” to achieve something analogous to transfer learning. We also dig into MOReL and the recent progress in offline reinforcement learning, the differences in developing MOReL models and traditional RL models, and the theoretical results they’re seeing from this research.

      <title>Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Enterprise with Charles Isbell - #441</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/machine-learning-as-a-software-engineering-enterprise-with-charles-isbell</link>
      <description>As we continue our NeurIPS 2020 series, we’re joined by friend-of-the-show Charles Isbell, Dean, John P. Imlay, Jr. Chair, and professor at the Georgia Tech College of Computing.
 This year Charles gave an Invited Talk at this year’s conference, You Can’t Escape Hyperparameters and Latent Variables: Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Enterprise. In our conversation, we explore the success of the Georgia Tech Online Masters program in CS, which now has over 11k students enrolled, and the importance of making the education accessible to as many people as possible. We spend quite a bit speaking about the impact machine learning is beginning to have on the world, and how we should move from thinking of ourselves as compiler hackers, and begin to see the possibilities and opportunities that have been ignored.
 We also touch on the fallout from Timnit Gebru being “resignated” and the importance of having diverse voices and different perspectives “in the room,” and what the future holds for machine learning as a discipline.

      <title>Natural Graph Networks with Taco Cohen - #440</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/natural-graph-networks-with-taco-cohen</link>
      <description>Today we kick off our NeurIPS 2020 series joined by Taco Cohen, a Machine Learning Researcher at Qualcomm Technologies.
 In our conversation with Taco, we discuss his current research in equivariant networks and video compression using generative models, as well as his paper “Natural Graph Networks,” which explores the concept of “naturality, a generalization of equivariance” which suggests that weaker constraints will allow for a “wider class of architectures.”
 We also discuss some of Taco’s recent research on neural compression and a very interesting visual demo for equivariance CNNs that Taco and the Qualcomm team released during the conference.

      <itunes:summary>Today we kick off our NeurIPS 2020 series joined by Taco Cohen, a Machine Learning Researcher at Qualcomm Technologies.
 In our conversation with Taco, we discuss his current research in equivariant networks and video compression using generative models, as well as his paper “Natural Graph Networks,” which explores the concept of “naturality, a generalization of equivariance” which suggests that weaker constraints will allow for a “wider class of architectures.”
 We also discuss some of Taco’s recent research on neural compression and a very interesting visual demo for equivariance CNNs that Taco and the Qualcomm team released during the conference.

      <title>ML Feature Store at Intuit with Srivathsan Canchi - #438</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ml-feature-store-at-intuit-with-srivathsan-canchi</link>
      <description>Today we continue our re:Invent series with Srivathsan Canchi, Head of Engineering for the Machine Learning Platform team at Intuit. 
 As we teased earlier this week, one of the major announcements coming from AWS at re:Invent was the release of the SageMaker Feature Store. To our pleasant surprise, we came to learn that our friends at Intuit are the original architects of this offering and partnered with AWS to productize it at a much broader scale. In our conversation with Srivathsan, we explore the focus areas that are supported by the Intuit machine learning platform across various teams, including QuickBooks and Mint, Turbotax, and Credit Karma,  and his thoughts on why companies should be investing in feature stores. 
 We also discuss why the concept of “feature store” has seemingly exploded in the last year, and how you know when your organization is ready to deploy one. Finally, we dig into the specifics of the feature store, including the popularity of graphQL and why they chose to include it in their pipelines, the similarities (and differences) between the two versions of the store, and much more!

      <title>re:Invent Roundup 2020 with Swami Sivasubramanian - #437</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/reinvent-roundup-2020-with-swami-sivasubramanian</link>
      <description>Today we’re kicking off our annual re:invent series joined by Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of Artificial Intelligence, at AWS.
 During re:Invent last week, Amazon made a ton of announcements on the machine learning front, including quite a few advancements to SageMaker. In this roundup conversation, we discuss the motivation for hosting the first-ever machine learning keynote at the conference, a bunch of details surrounding tools like Pipelines for workflow management, Clarify for bias detection, and JumpStart for easy to use algorithms and notebooks, and many more.
 We also discuss the emphasis placed on DevOps and MLOps tools in these announcements, and how the tools are all interconnected. Finally, we briefly touch on the announcement of the AWS feature store, but be sure to check back later this week for a more in-depth discussion on that particular release!

      <title>Predictive Disease Risk Modeling at 23andMe with Subarna Sinha - #436</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/predictive-disease-risk-modeling-at-23andme-with-subarna-sinha</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Subarna Sinha, Machine Learning Engineering Leader at 23andMe.
 23andMe handles a massive amount of genomic data every year from its core ancestry business but also uses that data for disease prediction, which is the core use case we discuss in our conversation.
 Subarna talks us through an initial use case of creating an evaluation of polygenic scores, and how that led them to build an ML pipeline and platform. We talk through the tools and tech stack used for the operationalization of their platform, the use of synthetic data, the internal pushback that came along with the changes that were being made, and what’s next for her team and the platform.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/scaling-video-ai-at-rtl-with-daan-odijk</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Daan Odijk, Data Science Manager at RTL.
 In our conversation with Daan, we explore the RTL MLOps journey, and their need to put platform infrastructure in place for ad optimization and forecasting, personalization, and content understanding use cases. Daan walks us through some of the challenges on both the modeling and engineering sides of building the platform, as well as the inherent challenges of video applications.
 Finally, we discuss the current state of their platform, and the benefits they’ve seen from having this infrastructure in place, and why using building a custom platform was worth the investment.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/benchmarking-ml-with-mlperf-w-peter-mattson</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Peter Mattson, General Chair at MLPerf, a Staff Engineer at Google, and President of MLCommons. 
 In our conversation with Peter, we discuss MLCommons and MLPerf, the former an open engineering group with the goal of accelerating machine learning innovation, and the latter a set of standardized Machine Learning speed benchmarks used to measure things like model training speed, throughput speed for inference. 
 We explore the target user for the MLPerf benchmarks, the need for benchmarks in the ethics, bias, fairness space, and how they’re approaching this through the "People’s Speech" datasets. We also walk through the MLCommons best practices of getting a model into production, why it's so difficult, and how MLCube can make the process easier for researchers and developers.

      <title>Deep Learning for NLP: From the Trenches with Charlene Chambliss - #433</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/deep-learning-for-nlp-from-the-trenches-with-charlene-chambliss</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Charlene Chambliss, Machine Learning Engineer at Primer AI. 
 Charlene, who we also had the pleasure of hosting at NLP Office Hours during TWIMLfest, is back to share some of the work she’s been doing with NLP. In our conversation, we explore her experiences working with newer NLP models and tools like BERT and HuggingFace, as well as whats she’s learned along the way with word embeddings, labeling tasks, debugging, and more. We also focus on a few of her projects, like her popular multi-lingual BERT project, and a COVID-19 classifier. 
 Finally, Charlene shares her experience getting into data science and machine learning coming from a non-technical background, and what the transition was like, and tips for people looking to make a similar shift.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enterprise ML in 2020: Still Hard! with Sushil Thomas - #429</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/scaling-enterprise-ml-in-2020-still-hard-with-sushil-thomas</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sushil Thomas, VP of Engineering for Machine Learning at Cloudera.
 Over the summer, I had the pleasure of hosting Sushil and a handful of business leaders across industries at the Cloudera Virtual Roundtable. In this conversation with Sushil, we recap the roundtable, exploring some of the topics discussed and insights gained from those conversations. Sushil gives us a look at how COVID19 has impacted business throughout the year, and how the pandemic is shaping enterprise decision making moving forward. 
 We also discuss some of the key trends he’s seeing as organizations try to scale their machine learning and AI efforts, including understanding best practices, and learning how to hybridize the engineering side of ML with the scientific exploration of the tasks. Finally, we explore if organizational models like hub vs centralized are still organization-specific or if that’s changed in recent years, as well as how to get and retain good ML talent with giant companies like Google and Microsoft looming large.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/enabling-clinical-automation-from-research-to-deployment-with-devin-singh</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Devin Singh, a Physician Lead for Clinical Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning in Pediatric Emergency Medicine at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, and Founder and CEO of HeroAI.
 In our conversation with Devin, we discuss some of the interesting ways that Devin is deploying machine learning within the SickKids hospital, the current structure of academic research, including how much research and publications are currently being incentivized, how little of those research projects actually make it to deployment, and how Devin is working to flip that system on it's head. 
 We also talk about his work at Hero AI, where he is commercializing and deploying his academic research to build out infrastructure and deploy AI solutions within hospitals, creating an automated pipeline with patients, caregivers, and EHS companies. Finally, we discuss Devins's thoughts on how he’d approach bias mitigation in these systems, and the importance of having proper stakeholder engagement and using design methodology when building ML systems.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/pixels-to-concepts-with-backpropagation-w-roland-memisevic</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Roland Memisevic, return podcast guest and Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Twenty Billion Neurons. 
 We last spoke to Roland in 2018, and just earlier this year TwentyBN made a sharp pivot to a surprising use case, a companion app called Fitness Ally, an interactive, personalized fitness coach on your phone. 
 In our conversation with Roland, we explore the progress TwentyBN has made on their goal of training deep neural networks to understand physical movement and exercise. We also discuss how they’ve taken their research on understanding video context and awareness and applied it in their app, including how recent advancements have allowed them to deploy their neural net locally while preserving privacy, and Roland’s thoughts on the enormous opportunity that lies in the merging of language and video processing.

      <itunes:summary>Today we’re joined by Roland Memisevic, return podcast guest and Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Twenty Billion Neurons. 
 We last spoke to Roland in 2018, and just earlier this year TwentyBN made a sharp pivot to a surprising use case, a companion app called Fitness Ally, an interactive, personalized fitness coach on your phone. 
 In our conversation with Roland, we explore the progress TwentyBN has made on their goal of training deep neural networks to understand physical movement and exercise. We also discuss how they’ve taken their research on understanding video context and awareness and applied it in their app, including how recent advancements have allowed them to deploy their neural net locally while preserving privacy, and Roland’s thoughts on the enormous opportunity that lies in the merging of language and video processing.

      <title>Fighting Global Health Disparities with AI w/ Jon Wang - #426</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/fighting-global-health-disparities-with-ai-w-jon-wang</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jon Wang, a medical student at UCSF, and former Gates Scholar and AI researcher at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
 In our conversation with Jon, we explore a few of the different ways he’s attacking various public health issues, including improving the electronic health records system through automating clinical order sets, and exploring how the lack of literature and AI talent in the non-profit and healthcare spaces, and bad data have further marginalized undersupported communities.
 We also discuss his work at the Gates Foundation, which included understanding how AI can be helpful in lower-resource and lower-income countries, and building digital infrastructure, and much more.

      <title>Accessibility and Computer Vision - #425</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/accessibility-and-computer-vision</link>
      <description>Digital imagery is pervasive today. More than a billion images per day are produced and uploaded to social media sites, with many more embedded within websites, apps, digital documents, and eBooks. Engaging with digital imagery has become fundamental to participating in contemporary society, including education, the professions, e-commerce, civics, entertainment, and social interactions.
 However, most digital images remain inaccessible to the 39 million people worldwide who are blind. AI and computer vision technologies hold the potential to increase image accessibility for people who are blind, through technologies like automated image descriptions.
 The speakers share their perspectives as people who are both technology experts and are blind, providing insight into future directions for the field of computer vision for describing images and videos for people who are blind.

      <title>NLP for Equity Investing with Frank Zhao - #424</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/424</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Frank Zhao, Senior Director of Quantamental Research at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
 In our conversation with Frank, we explore how he came to work at the intersection of ML and finance, and how he navigates the relationship between data science and domain expertise. We also discuss the rise of data science in the investment management space, examining the largely under-explored technique of using unstructured data to gain insights into equity investing, and the edge it can provide for investors.
 Finally, Frank gives us a look at how he uses natural language processing with textual data of earnings call transcripts and walks us through the entire pipeline.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/whats-next-for-fast-ai-w-jeremy-howard</link>
      <description>In this special #TWIMLfest episode of the podcast, we’re joined by Jeremy Howard, Founder of Fast.ai.
 In our conversation with Jeremy, we discuss his career path, including his journey through the consulting world and how those experiences led him down the path to ML education, his thoughts on the current state of the machine learning adoption cycle, and if we’re at maximum capacity for deep learning use and capability.
 Of course, we dig into the newest version of the fast.ai framework and course, the reception of Jeremy’s book ‘Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD,’ and what’s missing from the machine learning education landscape. If you’ve missed our previous conversations with Jeremy, I encourage you to check them out here and here.

      <title>Feature Stores for MLOps with Mike del Balso - #420</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/feature-stores-for-mlops-with-mike-del-balso</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Mike del Balso, co-Founder and CEO of Tecton. 
 Mike, who you might remember from our last conversation on the podcast, was a foundational member of the Uber team that created their ML platform, Michelangelo. Since his departure from the company in 2018, he has been busy building up Tecton, and their enterprise feature store. 
 In our conversation, Mike walks us through why he chose to focus on the feature store aspects of the machine learning platform, the journey, personal and otherwise, to operationalizing machine learning, and the capabilities that more mature platforms teams tend to look for or need to build. We also explore the differences between standalone components and feature stores, if organizations are taking their existing databases and building feature stores with them, and what a dynamic, always available feature store looks like in deployment. 
 Finally, we explore what sets Tecton apart from other vendors in this space, including enterprise cloud providers who are throwing their hat in the ring.

      <title>Exploring Causality and Community with Suzana Ilić - #419</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/exploring-causality-and-community-with-suzana-ilic</link>
      <description>In this special #TWIMLfest episode, we’re joined by Suzana Ilić, a computational linguist at Causaly and founder of Machine Learning Tokyo (MLT).
 Suzana joined us as a keynote speaker to discuss the origins of the MLT community, but we cover a lot of ground in this conversation. We briefly discuss Suzana’s work at Causaly, touching on her experiences transitioning from linguist and domain expert to working with causal modeling, balancing her role as both product manager and leader of the development team for their causality extraction module, and the unique ways that she thinks about UI in relation to their product.
 We also spend quite a bit of time exploring MLT, including how they’ve achieved exponential growth within the community over the past few years and when Suzana knew MLT was moving beyond just a personal endeavor, her experiences publishing papers at major ML conferences as an independent organization, and inspires her within the broader ML/AI Community. And of course, we answer quite a few great questions from our live audience!</description>

      <title>How Deep Learning has Revolutionized OCR with Cha Zhang - #416</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/how-deep-learning-has-revolutionized-ocr-with-cha-zhang</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Cha Zhang, a Partner Engineering Manager at Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI. 
 Cha’s work at MSFT is focused on exploring ways that new technologies can be applied to optical character recognition, or OCR, pushing the boundaries of what has been seen as an otherwise ‘solved’ problem. In our conversation with Cha, we explore some of the traditional challenges of doing OCR in the wild, and what are the ways in which deep learning algorithms are being applied to transform these solutions. 
 We also discuss the difficulties of using an end to end pipeline for OCR work, if there is a semi-supervised framing that could be used for OCR, the role of techniques like neural architecture search, how advances in NLP could influence the advancement of OCR problems, and much more.

      <title>ML-Powered Language Learning at Duolingo with Burr Settles - #412</title>
      <link>https://listen.twimlai.com/412</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Burr Settles, Research Director at Duolingo. Most would acknowledge that one of the most effective ways to learn is one on one with a tutor, and Duolingo’s main goal is to replicate that at scale.
 In our conversation with Burr, we dig how the business model has changed over time, the properties that make a good tutor, and how those features translate to the AI tutor they’ve built. We also discuss the Duolingo English Test, and the challenges they’ve faced with maintaining the platform while adding languages and courses.

      <title>Bridging The Gap Between Machine Learning and the Life Sciences with Artur Yakimovich - #411</title>
      <link>http://listen.twimlai.com/411</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Artur Yakimovich, Co-Founder at Artificial Intelligence for Life Sciences and a visiting scientist in the Lab for Molecular Cell Biology at University College London. In our conversation with Artur, we explore the gulf that exists between life science researchers and the tools and applications used by computer scientists. 
 While Artur’s background is in viral chemistry, he has since transitioned to a career in computational biology to “see where chemistry stopped, and biology started.” We discuss his work in that middle ground, looking at quite a few of his recent work applying deep learning and advanced neural networks like capsule networks to his research problems. 
 Finally, we discuss his efforts building the Artificial Intelligence for Life Sciences community, a non-profit organization he founded to bring scientists from different fields together to share ideas and solve interdisciplinary problems.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/pytorch-3d-deep-learning-for-3d-data-with-georgia-gkioxari</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Georgia Gkioxari, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research. 
 Georgia was hand-picked by the TWIML community to discuss her work on the recently released open-source library PyTorch3D. In our conversation, Georgia describes her experiences as a computer vision researcher prior to the 2012 deep learning explosion, and how the entire landscape has changed since then. 
 Georgia walks us through the user experience of PyTorch3D, while also detailing who the target audience is, why the library is useful, and how it fits in the broad goal of giving computers better means of perception. Finally, Georgia gives us a look at what it’s like to be a co-chair for CVPR 2021 and the challenges with updating the peer review process for the larger academic conferences.

      <title>What are the Implications of Algorithmic Thinking? with Michael I. Jordan - #407</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/go/407</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by the legendary Michael I. Jordan, Distinguished Professor in the Departments of EECS and Statistics at UC Berkeley. 
 Michael was gracious enough to connect us all the way from Italy after being named  IEEE’s 2020 John von Neumann Medal recipient. In our conversation with Michael, we explore his career path, and how his influence from other fields like philosophy shaped his path. 
 We spend quite a bit of time discussing his current exploration into the intersection of economics and AI, and how machine learning systems could be used to create value and empowerment across many industries through “markets.” We also touch on the potential of “interacting learning systems” at scale, the valuation of data, the commoditization of human knowledge into computational systems, and much, much more.

      <title>Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Sameer Singh - #406</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/beyond-accuracy-behavioral-testing-of-nlp-models-with-sameer-singh</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Sameer Singh, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at UC Irvine. 
 Sameer’s work centers on large-scale and interpretable machine learning applied to information extraction and natural language processing. We caught up with Sameer right after he was awarded the best paper award at ACL 2020 for his work on Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList.
 In our conversation, we explore CheckLists, the task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models introduced in the paper. We also discuss how well we understand the cause of pitfalls or failure modes in deep learning models, Sameer’s thoughts on embodied AI, and his work on the now famous LIME paper, which he co-authored alongside Carlos Guestrin.

      <title>Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Discipline with Dillon Erb - #404</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/machine-learning-as-a-software-engineering-discipline-with-dillon-erb</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Dillon Erb, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Paperspace.
 We’ve followed Paperspace since their origins offering GPU-enabled compute resources to data scientists and machine learning developers, to the release of their Jupyter-based Gradient service. Our conversation with Dillon centered on the challenges that organizations face building and scaling repeatable machine learning workflows, and how they’ve done this in their own platform by applying time-tested software engineering practices. 
 We also discuss the importance of reproducibility in production machine learning pipelines, how the processes and tools of software engineering map to the machine learning workflow, and technical issues that ML teams run into when trying to scale the ML workflow.

      <title>AI and the Responsible Data Economy with Dawn Song - #403</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/ai-and-the-responsible-data-economy-with-dawn-song</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, Dawn Song. Dawn’s research is centered at the intersection of AI, deep learning, security, and privacy. She’s currently focused on bringing these disciplines together with her startup, Oasis Labs. 
 In our conversation, we explore their goals of building a ‘platform for a responsible data economy,’ which would combine techniques like differential privacy, blockchain, and homomorphic encryption. The platform would give consumers more control of their data, and enable businesses to better utilize data in a privacy-preserving and responsible way. 
 We also discuss how to privatize and anonymize data in language models like GPT-3, real-world examples of adversarial attacks and how to train against them, her work on program synthesis to get towards AGI, and her work on privatizing coronavirus contact tracing data.

      <link>https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-378-rethinking-model-size-train-large-then-compress-with-joseph-gonzalez</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Joseph Gonzalez, Assistant Professor in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. 

In our conversation, we explore Joseph’s paper “Train Large, Then Compress: Rethinking Model Size for Efficient Training and Inference of Transformers,” which looks at compute-efficient training strategies for models. We discuss the two main problems being solved; 1) How can we rapidly iterate on variations in architecture? And 2) If we make models bigger, is it really improving any efficiency?</description>

Our discussion covers a lot of ground, but centers on the question, "Is Linguistics Missing from NLP Research?" We explore if we would be making more progress, on more solid foundations, if more linguists were involved in NLP research, or is the progress we're making (e.g. with deep learning models like Transformers) just fine?</description>

      <description>Today we’re joined by Kamran Khan, founder &amp; CEO of BlueDot, and professor of medicine and public health at the University of Toronto.

      <title>Swarm AI for Event Outcome Prediction with Gregg Willcox - TWIML Talk #299</title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-299-swarm-ai-for-event-outcome-prediction-with-gregg-willcox</link>
      <description>Today we're joined by Gregg Willcox, Director of Research and Development at Unanimous AI. Inspired by the natural phenomenon called 'swarming', which uses the collective intelligence of a group to produce more accurate results than an individual alone, ‘Swarm AI’ was born. A game-like platform that channels the convictions of individuals to come to a consensus and using a behavioral neural network trained on people’s behavior called ‘Conviction’, to further amplify the results.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of the Forget Gate with Jos Van Der Westhuizen - TWiML Talk #240 </title>
      <link>https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-240-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-forget-gate-with-jos-van-der-westhuizen</link>
      <description>Today we’re joined by Jos Van Der Westhuizen, PhD student in Engineering at Cambridge University.

Jos’ research focuses on applying LSTMs, or Long Short-Term Memory neural networks, to biological data for various tasks. In our conversation, we discuss his paper "The unreasonable effectiveness of the forget gate," in which he explores the various “gates” that make up an LSTM module and the general impact of getting rid of gates on the computational intensity of training the networks.</description>

Hanna and I really dig into how bias and a lack of interpretability and transparency show up across ML. We discuss the role that human biases, even those that are inadvertent, play in tainting data, and whether deployment of “fair” ML models can actually be achieved in practice, and much more. Hanna points us to a TON of resources to further explore the topic of fairness in ML, which you’ll find at twimlai.com/talk</description>

      <itunes:summary>Today we’re joined by Hanna Wallach, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research.

Hanna and I really dig into how bias and a lack of interpretability and transparency show up across ML. We discuss the role that human biases, even those that are inadvertent, play in tainting data, and whether deployment of “fair” ML models can actually be achieved in practice, and much more. Hanna points us to a TON of resources to further explore the topic of fairness in ML, which you’ll find at twimlai.com/talk</itunes:summary>

      <description>In this, the final episode of our PegaWorld series I’m joined by Vince Jeffs, Senior Director of Product Strategy for AI and Decisioning at Pegasystems. Vince and I had a great talk about the role AI and advanced analytics will play in defining future customer experiences. We do this in the context provided by one of his presentations from the conference, which explores four technology scenarios from Pegasystems’ innovation labs. These look at a connected car experience, the use of deep learning for diagnostics, dynamic notifications, and continuously optimized marketing. We also get into an interesting discussion about how much is too much when it comes to hyperpersonalized experiences, and how businesses can manage this challenge.

      <title>Workforce Intelligence for Automation &amp; Productivity with Michael Kempe - TWiML Talk #153</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/461036040-twiml-twiml-talk-153-workforce-intelligence-for-automation-productivity-with-michael-kempe.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode of our PegaWorld series, I’m joined by Michael Kempe, chief operating officer at global share registry and financial services provider Link Market Services. In the interview, Michael and I dig into Link’s use of workforce intelligence software to allow it to track and analyze the performance of its workforce and business processes. Michael and I discuss some of the initial challenges associated with implementing this type of system, including skepticism amongst employees, and how it ultimately sets the stage for the Link’s broader use of machine learning, AI and so called “robotic process automation” to increase workforce productivity.

      <title>How a Global Energy Company Adopts ML &amp; AI with Nicholas Osborn - TWiML Talk #150</title>

      <description>On today’s show I’m excited to share this interview with Nick Osborn, a longtime listener of the show and Leader of the Global Machine Learning Project Management Office at AES Corporation, a Fortune 200 power company. Nick and I met at my AI Summit a few weeks back, and after a brief chat about some of the things he was up to at AES, I knew I needed to get him on the show! In this interview, Nick and I explore how AES is implementing machine learning across multiple domains at the company. We dig into several examples falling under the Natural Language, Computer Vision, and Cognitive Assets categories he’s established for his projects. Along the way we cover some of the key podcast episodes that helped Nick discover potentially applicable ML techniques, and how those are helping his team broaden the use of machine learning at AES. This was a fun and informative conversation that has a lot to offer. Thanks, Nick! The notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/talk/150.</description>

      <title>Problem Formulation for Machine Learning with Romer Rosales - TWiML Talk #149</title>

      <description>In this episode, i'm joined by Romer Rosales, Director of AI at LinkedIn. We begin with a discussion of graphical models and approximate probability inference, and he helps me make an important connection in the way I think about that topic. We then review some of the applications of machine learning at LinkedIn, and how what Romer calls their ‘holistic approach’ guides the evolution of ML projects at LinkedIn. This leads us into a really interesting discussion about problem formulation and selecting the right objective function for a given problem. We then talk through some of the tools they’ve built to scale their data science efforts, including large-scale constrained optimization solvers, online hyperparameter optimization and more. This was a really fun conversation, that I’m sure you’ll enjoy! The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/149.</description>

      <description>In this episode I’m joined by Greg Mulholland, Founder and CEO of Citrine Informatics, which is applying AI to the discovery and development of new materials. Greg and I start out with an exploration of some of the challenges of the status quo in materials science, and what’s to be gained by introducing machine learning into this process. We discuss how limitations in materials manifest themselves, and Greg shares a few examples from the company’s work optimizing battery components and solar cells. We dig into the role and sources of data used in applying ML in materials, and some of the unique challenges to collecting it, and discuss the pipeline and algorithms Citrine uses to deliver its service. This was a fun conversation that spans physics, chemistry, and of course machine learning, and I hope you enjoy it. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/148.</description>

      <title>Deep Gradient Compression for Distributed Training with Song Han - TWiML Talk #146</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/451775115-twiml-twiml-talk-146-deep-gradient-compression-for-distributed-training-with-song-han.mp3</link>
      <description>On today’s show I chat with Song Han, assistant professor in MIT’s EECS department, about his research on Deep Gradient Compression. In our conversation, we explore the challenge of distributed training for deep neural networks and the idea of compressing the gradient exchange to allow it to be done more efficiently. Song details the evolution of distributed training systems based on this idea, and provides a few examples of centralized and decentralized distributed training architectures such as Uber’s Horovod, as well as the approaches native to Pytorch and Tensorflow. Song also addresses potential issues that arise when considering distributed training, such as loss of accuracy and generalizability, and much more.

      <title>Masked Autoregressive Flow for Density Estimation with George Papamakarios - TWiML Talk #145</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/450384765-twiml-twiml-talk-145-masked-autoregressive-flow-for-density-estimation-with-george-papamakarios.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode, University of Edinburgh Phd student George Papamakarios and I discuss his paper “Masked Autoregressive Flow for Density Estimation.” George walks us through the idea of Masked Autoregressive Flow, which uses neural networks to produce estimates of probability densities from a set of input examples. We discuss some of the related work that’s laid the groundwork for his research, including Inverse Autoregressive Flow, Real NVP and Masked Auto-encoders. We also look at the properties of probability density networks and discuss some of the challenges associated with this effort.

      <title>Training Data for Computer Vision at Figure Eight with Qazaleh Mirsharif - TWiML Talk #144</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/449148126-twiml-twiml-talk-144-training-data-for-computer-vision-at-figure-eight-with-qazaleh-mirsharif.mp3</link>
      <description>For today’s show, the last in our TrainAI series, I'm joined by Qazaleh Mirsharif, a machine learning scientist working on computer vision at Figure Eight. Qazaleh and I caught up at the TrainAI conference to discuss a couple of the projects she’s worked on in that field, namely her research into the classification of retinal images and her work on parking sign detection from Google Street View images. The former, which attempted to diagnose diseases like diabetic retinopathy using retinal scan images, is similar to the work I spoke with Ryan Poplin about on TWiML Talk #122. In my conversation with Qazaleh we focus on how she built her datasets for each of these projects and some of the key lessons she’s learned along the way.

      <description>Today we continue our TrainAI series with Sarah Aerni, Director of Data Science at Salesforce Einstein. Sarah and I sat down at the TrainAI conference to discuss her talk “Notes from the Field: The Platform, People, and Processes of Agile Data Science.” Sarah and I dig into the concept of agile data science, exploring what it means to her and how she’s seen it done at Salesforce and other places she’s worked. We also dig into the notion of machine learning platforms, which is also a keen area of interest for me. We discuss some of the common elements we’ve seen in ML platforms, and when it makes sense for an organization to start building one. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/143.

      <description>In this episode of our TrainAI series, I sit down with Anima Anandkumar, Bren Professor at Caltech and Principal Scientist with Amazon Web Services. Anima joined me to discuss the research coming out of her “Tensorlab” at CalTech. In our conversation, we review the application of tensor operations to machine learning and discuss how an example problem–document categorization–might be approached using 3 dimensional tensors to discover topics and relationships between topics. We touch on multidimensionality, expectation maximization, and Amazon products Sagemaker and Comprehend. Anima also goes into how to tensorize neural networks and apply our understanding of tensor algebra to do perform better architecture searches.

      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/447233793-twiml-twiml-talk-140-checking-in-with-the-master-with-garry-kasparov.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode I’m joined by legendary chess champion, author, and fellow at the Oxford Martin School, Garry Kasparov. Garry and I sat down after his keynote at the Figure Eight Train AI conference in San Francisco last week. Garry and I discuss his bouts with the chess-playing computer Deep Blue–which became the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in their 1997 rematch–and how that experience has helped shaped his thinking on artificially intelligent systems. We explore his perspective on the evolution of AI, the ways in which chess and Deep Blue differ from Go and Alpha Go, and the significance of DeepMind’s Alpha Go Zero. We also talk through his views on the relationship between humans and machines, and how he expects it to change over time. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/140.

      <title>Practical Deep Learning with Rachel Thomas - TWiML Talk #138</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/443972214-twiml-twiml-talk-138-practical-deep-learning-with-rachel-thomas.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode, i'm joined by Rachel Thomas, founder and researcher at Fast AI. If you’re not familiar with Fast AI, the company offers a series of courses including Practical Deep Learning for Coders, Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders and Rachel’s Computational Linear Algebra course. The courses are designed to make deep learning more accessible to those without the extensive math backgrounds some other courses assume. Rachel and I cover a lot of ground in this conversation, starting with the philosophy and goals behind the Fast AI courses. We also cover Fast AI’s recent decision to switch to their courses from Tensorflow to Pytorch, the reasons for this, and the lessons they’ve learned in the process. We discuss the role of the Fast AI deep learning library as well, and how it was recently used to held their team achieve top results on a popular industry benchmark of training time and training cost by a factor of more than ten.

      <description>In this episode, I'm joined by Jose Hernandez-Orallo, professor in the department of information systems and computing at Universitat Politècnica de València and fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, working on the Kinds of Intelligence Project. Jose and I caught up at NIPS last year after the Kinds of Intelligence Symposium that he helped organize there. In our conversation, we discuss the three main themes of the symposium: understanding and identifying the main types of intelligence, including non-human intelligence, developing better ways to test and measure these intelligences, and understanding how and where research efforts should focus to best benefit society.

      <title>Taming arXiv with Natural Language Processing w/ John Bohannon - TWiML Talk #136</title>

      <description>In this episode i'm joined by John Bohannan, Director of Science at AI startup Primer. As you all may know, a few weeks ago we released my interview with Google legend Jeff Dean, which, by the way, you should definitely check if you haven’t already. Anyway, in that interview, Jeff mentions the recent explosion of machine learning papers on arXiv, which I responded to jokingly by asking whether Google had already developed the AI system to help them summarize and track all of them. While Jeff didn’t have anything specific to offer, a listener reached out and let me know that John was in fact already working on this problem. In our conversation, John and I discuss his work on Primer Science, a tool that harvests content uploaded to arxiv, sorts it into natural topics using unsupervised learning, then gives relevant summaries of the activity happening in different innovation areas. We spend a good amount of time on the inner workings of Primer Science, including their data pipeline and some of the tools they use, how they determine “ground truth” for training their models, and the use of heuristics to supplement NLP in their processing.

      <description>In this episode, our final episode in the Differential Privacy series, I speak with Chang Liu, applied research scientist at Georgian Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in growth stage business software companies in the US and Canada. Chang joined me to discuss Georgian’s new offering, Epsilon, a software product that embodies the research, development and lessons learned helps in helping their portfolio companies deliver differentially private machine learning solutions to their customers. In our conversation, Chang discusses some of the projects that led to the creation of Epsilon, including differentially private machine learning projects at BlueCore, Work Fusion and Integrate.ai. We explore some of the unique challenges of productizing differentially private ML, including business, people and technology issues. Finally, Chang provides some great pointers for those who’d like to further explore this field. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/135</description>

      <description>In this episode of our Differential Privacy series, I'm joined by Nicolas Papernot, Google PhD Fellow in Security and graduate student in the department of computer science at Penn State University. Nicolas and I continue this week’s look into differential privacy with a discussion of his recent paper, Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning From Private Training Data. In our conversation, Nicolas describes the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles model proposed in this paper, and how it ensures differential privacy in a scalable manner that can be applied to Deep Neural Networks. We also explore one of the interesting side effects of applying differential privacy to machine learning, namely that it inherently resists overfitting, leading to more generalized models. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/134.</description>

We also explore one of the interesting side effects of applying differential privacy to machine learning, namely that it inherently resists overfitting, leading to more generalized models.

      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/437850480-twiml-twiml-talk-133-differential-privacy-at-bluecore-with-zahi-karam.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode of our Differential Privacy series, I'm joined by Zahi Karam, Director of Data Science at Bluecore, whose retail marketing platform specializes in personalized email marketing. I sat down with Zahi at the Georgian Partners portfolio conference last year, where he gave me my initial exposure to the field of differential privacy, ultimately leading to this series. Zahi shared his insights into how differential privacy can be deployed in the real world and some of the technical and cultural challenges to doing so. We discuss the Bluecore use case in depth, including why and for whom they build differentially private machine learning models.

      <description>In the first episode of our Differential Privacy series, I'm joined by Aaron Roth, associate professor of computer science and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. Aaron is first and foremost a theoretician, and our conversation starts with him helping us understand the context and theory behind differential privacy, a research area he was fortunate to begin pursuing at its inception. We explore the application of differential privacy to machine learning systems, including the costs and challenges of doing so. Aaron discusses as well quite a few examples of differential privacy in action, including work being done at Google, Apple and the US Census Bureau, along with some of the major research directions currently being explored in the field.

      <description>In this episode, we're joined by Rob Walker, Vice President of decision management and analytics at Pegasystems, a leading provider of software for customer engagement and operational excellence. Rob and I discuss what’s required for enterprises to fully realize the vision of providing a hyper-personalized customer experience, and how machine learning and AI can be used to determine the next best action an organization should take to optimize sales, service, retention, and risk at every step in the customer relationship. Along the way we dig into a couple of key areas, specifically some of the techniques his organization uses to allow customers to manage the tradeoff between model performance and transparency, particularly in light of new laws like GDPR, and how all this ties to an enterprise’s ability to manage bias and ethical issues when deploying ML. We cover a lot of ground in this one and I think you’ll find Rob’s perspective really interesting. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/127.</description>

      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/427209351-twiml-twiml-talk-126-information-extraction-natural-document-formats-david-rosenberg.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode, I’m joined by David Rosenberg, data scientist in the office of the CTO at financial publisher Bloomberg, to discuss his work on “Extracting Data from Tables and Charts in Natural Document Formats.” Bloomberg is dealing with tons of financial and company data in pdfs and other unstructured document formats on a daily basis. To make meaning from this information more efficiently, David and his team have implemented a deep learning pipeline for extracting data from the documents. In our conversation, we dig into the information extraction process, including how it was built, how they sourced their training data, why they used LaTeX as an intermediate representation and how and why they optimize on pixel-perfect accuracy. There’s a lot of interesting info in this show and I think you’re going to enjoy it. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/126.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop AI for Emergency Response &amp; More w/ Robert Munro - TWiML Talk #125</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/425249055-twiml-twiml-talk-125-human-loop-ai-emergency-response-robert-munro.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode, I chat with Rob Munro, CTO of the newly branded Figure Eight, formerly known as CrowdFlower. Figure Eight’s Human-in-the-Loop AI platform supports data science &amp; machine learning teams working on autonomous vehicles, consumer product identification, natural language processing, search relevance, intelligent chatbots, and more. Rob and I had a really interesting discussion covering some of the work he’s previously done applying machine learning to disaster response and epidemiology, including a use case involving text translation in the wake of the catastrophic 2010 Haiti earthquake. We also dig into some of the technical challenges that he’s encountered in trying to scale the human-in-the-loop side of machine learning since joining Figure Eight, including identifying more efficient approaches to image annotation as well as the use of zero shot machine learning to minimize training data requirements. Finally, we briefly discuss Figure Eight’s upcoming TrainAI conference, which takes place on May 9th &amp; 10th in San Francisco. Train AI you can join me and Rob, along with a host of amazing speakers like Garry Kasparov, Andrej Karpathy, Marti Hearst and many more and receive hands-on AI, machine learning and deep learning training through real-world case studies on practical machine learning applications.

      <description>In this episode I’m joined by Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow and head of the company’s deep learning research team Google Brain, who I had a chance to sit down with last week at the Googleplex in Mountain View. As you’ll hear, I was very excited for this interview, because so many of Jeff’s contributions since he started at Google in ‘99 have touched my life and work. In our conversation, Jeff and I dig into a bunch of the core machine learning innovations we’ve seen from Google. Of course we discuss TensorFlow, and its origins and evolution at Google. We also explore AI acceleration hardware, including TPU v1, v2 and future directions from Google and the broader market in this area. We talk through the machine learning toolchain, including some things that Googlers might take for granted, and where the recently announced Cloud AutoML fits in. We also discuss Google’s process for mapping problems across a variety of domains to deep learning, and much, much more. This was definitely one of my favorite conversations, and I'm pumped to be able to share it with you. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/124.</description>

      <description>In this episode I’m joined by Lyne Tchapmi, PhD student in the Stanford Computational Vision and Geometry Lab, to discuss her paper, “SEGCloud: Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds.” SEGCloud is an end-to-end framework that performs 3D point-level segmentation combining the advantages of neural networks, trilinear interpolation and fully connected conditional random fields. In our conversation, Lyne and I cover the ins and outs of semantic segmentation, starting from the sensor data that we’re trying to segment, 2d vs 3d representations of that data, and how we go about automatically identifying classes. Along the way we dig into some of the details, including how she obtained a more fine grain labeling of points from sensor data and the transition from point clouds to voxels.

      <title>Reproducibility and the Philosophy of Data with Clare Gollnick - TWiML Talk #121</title>

      <description>In this episode, i'm joined by Clare Gollnick, CTO of Terbium Labs, to discuss her thoughts on the “reproducibility crisis” currently haunting the scientific landscape. For a little background, a “Nature” survey in 2016 showed that "more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments." Clare gives us her take on the situation, and how it applies to data science, along with some great nuggets about the philosophy of data and a few interesting use cases as well. We also cover her thoughts on Bayesian vs Frequentist techniques and while we’re at it, the Vim vs Emacs debate. No, actually I’m just kidding on that last one. But this was indeed a very fun conversation that I think you’ll enjoy! For the complete show notes, visit twimlai.com/talk/121.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks Against Reinforcement Learning Agents with Ian Goodfellow &amp; Sandy Huang</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/414102462-twiml-twiml-talk-119-adversarial-attacks-reinforcement-learning-agents-ian-goodfellow-sandy-huang.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode, I’m joined by Ian Goodfellow, Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and Sandy Huang, Phd Student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley, to discuss their work on the paper Adversarial Attacks on Neural Network Policies. If you’re a regular listener here you’ve probably heard of adversarial attacks, and have seen examples of deep learning based object detectors that can be fooled into thinking that, for example, a giraffe is actually a school bus, by injecting some imperceptible noise into the image. Well, Sandy and Ian’s paper sits at the intersection of adversarial attacks and reinforcement learning, another area we’ve discussed quite a bit on the podcast. In their paper, they describe how adversarial attacks can also be effective at targeting neural network policies in reinforcement learning. Sandy gives us an overview of the paper, including how changing a single pixel value can throw off performance of a model trained to play Atari games. We also cover a lot of interesting topics relating to adversarial attacks and RL individually, and some related areas such as hierarchical reward functions and transfer learning. This was a great conversation that I’m really excited to bring to you! For complete show notes, head over to twimlai.com/talk/119</description>

      <description>In this episode, we're joined by Raja Chatila, director of Intelligent Systems and Robotics at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, and executive committee chair of the IEEE global initiative on ethics of intelligent and autonomous systems. Raja and I had a great chat about his research, which deals with robotic perception and discovery. We discuss the relationship between learning and discovery, particularly as it applies to robots and their environments, and the connection between robotic perception and action. We also dig into the concepts of affordances, abstract teachings, meta-reasoning and self-awareness as they apply to intelligent systems. Finally, we touch on the issue of values and ethics of these systems. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/118.</description>

      <title>Discovering Exoplanets w/ Deep Learning with Chris Shallue - TWiML Talk #117</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/410558802-twiml-twiml-talk-117-discovering-exoplanets-deep-learning-chris-shallue.mp3</link>
      <description>Earlier this week, I had a chance to speak with Chris Shallue, Senior Software Engineer on the Google Brain Team, about his project and paper on “Exploring Exoplanets with Deep Learning.” This is a great story. Chris, inspired by a book he was reading, reached out on a whim to a Harvard astrophysics researcher, kicking off a collaboration and side project eventually leading to the discovery of two new planets outside our solar system. In our conversation, we walk through the entire process Chris followed to find these two exoplanets, including how he researched the domain as an outsider, how he sourced and processed his dataset, and how he built and evolved his models. Finally, we discuss the results of his project and his plans for future work in this area. This podcast is being published in parallel with Google’s release of the source code and data that Chris developed and used, which we’ll link to below, so if what you hear inspires you to dig into this area, you’ve got a nice head start. This was a really interesting conversation, and I'm excited to share it with you! The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/117 The corresponding blog post for this project can be found at https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/open-sourcing-hunt-for-exoplanets.html</description>

      <title>Learning Active Learning with Ksenia Konyushkova - TWiML Talk #116</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/409174488-twiml-twiml-talk-116-learning-active-learning-data-ksenia-konyushkova.mp3</link>
      <description>In this episode, I speak with Ksenia Konyushkova, Ph.D. student in the CVLab at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland. Ksenia and I connected at NIPS in December to discuss her interesting research into ways we might apply machine learning to ease the challenge of creating labeled datasets for machine learning. The first paper we discuss is “Learning Active Learning from Data,” which suggests a data-driven approach to active learning that trains a secondary model to identify the unlabeled data points which, when labeled, would likely have the greatest impact on our primary model’s performance. We also discuss her paper “Learning Intelligent Dialogs for Bounding Box Annotation,” in which she trains an agent to guide the actions of a human annotator to more quickly produce bounding boxes. TWiML Online Meetup Update Join us Tuesday, March 13th for the March edition of the Online Meetup! Sean Devlin will be doing an in-depth review of reinforcement learning and presenting the Google DeepMind paper, "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning."

      <description>In this episode, I speak with Mike Del Balso, Product Manager for Machine Learning Platforms at Uber. Mike and I sat down last fall at the Georgian Partners Portfolio conference to discuss his presentation “Finding success with machine learning in your company.” In our discussion, Mike shares some great advice for organizations looking to get value out of machine learning. He also details some of the pitfalls companies run into, such as not have proper infrastructure in place for maintenance and monitoring, not managing their expectations, and not putting the right tools in place for data science and development teams. On this last point, we touch on the Michelangelo platform, which Uber uses internally to build, deploy and maintain ML systems at scale, and the open source distributed TensorFlow system they’ve created, Horovod. This was a very insightful interview, so get your notepad ready! Vote on our #MyAI Contest! Over the past few weeks, you’ve heard us talk quite a bit about our #MyAI Contest, which explores the role we see for AI in our personal lives! We received some outstanding entries, and now it’s your turn to check them out and vote for a winner. Do this by visiting our contest page at https://twimlai.com/myai.

      <title>Inverse Programming for Deeper AI with Zenna Tavares - TWiML Talk #114</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/405530181-twiml-twiml-talk-114-inverse-programming-deeper-ai-zenna-tavares.mp3</link>
      <description>For today’s show, the final episode of our Black in AI Series, I’m joined by Zenna Tavares, a PhD student in the both the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. I spent some time with Zenna after his talk at the Strange Loop conference titled “Running Programs in Reverse for Deeper AI.” Zenna shares some great insight into his work on program inversion, an idea which lies at the intersection of Bayesian modeling, deep-learning, and computational logic. We set the stage with a discussion of inverse graphics and the similarities between graphic inversion and vision inversion. We then discuss the application of these techniques to intelligent systems, including the idea of parametric inversion. Last but not least, zenna details how these techniques might be implemented, and discusses his work on ReverseFlow, a library to execute tensorflow programs backwards, and Sigma.jl a probabilistic programming environment implemented in the dynamic programming language Julia. This talk packs a punch, and I’m glad to share it with you. Be sure to check out some of the great names that will be at the AI Conference in New York, Apr 29–May 2, where you'll join the leading minds in AI, Peter Norvig, George Church, Olga Russakovsky, Manuela Veloso, and Zoubin Ghahramani.

      <description>In this episode, I speak with Sriraam Natarajan, Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at UT Dallas. While at NIPS a few months back, Sriraam and I sat down to discuss his work on Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence. StarAI is the combination of probabilistic &amp; statistical machine learning techniques with relational databases. We cover systems learning on top of relational databases and making predictions with relational data, with quite a few examples from the healthcare field. Sriraam and his collaborators have also developed BoostSRL, a gradient-boosting based approach to learning different types of statistical relational models. We briefly touch on this, along with other implementation approaches. Join the #MyAI Discussion! As a TWiML listener, you probably have an opinion on the role AI will play in our lives, and we want to hear your take. Sharing your thoughts takes two minutes, can be done from anywhere, and qualifies you to win some great prizes. So hit pause, and jump on over twimlai.com/myai right now to share or learn more.

      <description>In this episode, part 4 in our Black in AI series, i'm joined by Charles Onu, Phd Student at McGill University in Montreal &amp; Founder of Ubenwa, a startup tackling the problem of infant mortality due to asphyxia. Using SVMs and other techniques from the field of automatic speech recognition, Charles and his team have built a model that detects asphyxia based on the audible noises the child makes upon birth. We go into the process he used to collect his training data, including the specific methods they used to record samples, and how their samples will be used to maximize accuracy in the field. We also take a deep dive into some of the challenges of building and deploying the platform and mobile application. This is a really interesting use case, which I think you’ll enjoy.

      <description>In today’s episode, I’m joined by Roland Memisevic, co-founder, CEO, and chief scientist at Twenty Billion Neurons. Roland joined me at the RE•WORK Deep Learning Summit in Montreal to discuss the work his company is doing to train deep neural networks to understand physical actions. In our conversation, we dig into video analysis and understanding, including how data-rich video can help us develop what Roland calls comparative understanding, or AI “common sense”. We briefly touch on the implications of AI/ML systems having comparative understanding, and how Roland and his team are addressing problems like getting properly labeled training data. Enter Our #MyAI Contest! Are you looking forward to the role AI will play in your life, or in your children’s lives? Or, are you afraid of what’s to come, and the changes AI will bring? Or, maybe you’re skeptical, and don’t think we’ll ever really achieve enough with AI to make a difference? In any case, if you’re a TWiML listener, you probably have an opinion on the role AI will play in our lives, and we want to hear your take.

      <description>In this episode, the third in our Black in AI series, I speak with Ayanna Howard, Chair of the Interactive School of Computing at Georgia Tech. Ayanna joined me for a lively discussion about her work in the field of human-robot interaction. We dig deep into a couple of major areas she’s active in that have significant implications for the way we design and use artificial intelligence, namly pediatric robotics and human-robot trust. That latter bit is particularly interesting, and Ayanna provides a really interesting overview of a few of her experiments, including a simulation of an emergency situation, where, well, I don’t want to spoil it, but let’s just say as the actual intelligent beings, we need to make some better decisions. Enjoy! Are you looking forward to the role AI will play in your life, or in your children’s lives? Or, are you afraid of what’s to come, and the changes AI will bring? Or, maybe you’re skeptical, and don’t think we’ll ever really achieve enough with AI to make a difference?

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, the third in our Black in AI series, I speak with Ayanna Howard, Chair of the Interactive School of Computing at Georgia Tech. Ayanna joined me for a lively discussion about her work in the field of human-robot interaction. We dig deep into a couple of major areas she’s active in that have significant implications for the way we design and use artificial intelligence, namly pediatric robotics and human-robot trust. That latter bit is particularly interesting, and Ayanna provides a really interesting overview of a few of her experiments, including a simulation of an emergency situation, where, well, I don’t want to spoil it, but let’s just say as the actual intelligent beings, we need to make some better decisions. Enjoy! Are you looking forward to the role AI will play in your life, or in your children’s lives? Or, are you afraid of what’s to come, and the changes AI will bring? Or, maybe you’re skeptical, and don’t think we’ll ever really achieve enough with AI to make a difference? As a TWiML listener, you probably have an opinion on the role AI will play in our lives, and we want to hear your take. Sharing your thoughts takes two minutes, can be done from anywhere, and qualifies you to win some great prizes. So hit pause, and jump on over twimlai.com/myai right now to share or learn more.

      <title>Data Science for Poaching Prevention and Disease Treatment with Nyalleng Moorosi - TWiML Talk #109</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/396479022-twiml-twiml-talk-109-data-science-poaching-prevention-disease-treatment-nyalleng-moorosi.mp3</link>
      <description>For today’s show, I'm joined by Nyalleng Moorosi, Senior Data Science Researcher at The Council for Scientific &amp; Industrial Research or CSIR, in Pretoria, South Africa. In our discussion, we discuss two major projects that Nyalleng is apart of at the CSIR, one, a predictive policing use case, which focused on understanding and preventing rhino poaching in Kruger National Park, and the other, a healthcare use case which focuses on understanding the effects of a drug treatment that was causing pancreatic cancer in South Africans. Along the way we talk about the challenges of data collection, data pipelines and overcoming sparsity. This was a really interesting conversation that I’m sure you’ll enjoy.

      <description>In this episode I’m joined by Michel Allegue and Negar Ghourchian of Aerial.ai. Aerial is doing some really interesting things in the home automation space, by using wifi signal statistics to identify and understand what’s happening in our homes and office environments. Michel, the CTO, describes some of the capabilities of their platform, including its ability to detect not only people and pets within the home, but surprising characteristics like breathing rates and patterns. He also gives us a look into the data collection process, including the types of data needed, how they obtain it, and how it is parsed. Negar, a senior data scientist with Aerial, describes the types of models used, including semi-supervised, unsupervised and signal processing based models, and how they’ve scaled their platform, and provides us with some real-world use cases.

      <description>In this episode, I'm joined by Andrew Stein, computer vision engineer at consumer robotics company Anki, and his partner in crime Cozmo, a toy robot with tons of personality. Andrew joined me during the hustle and bustle of CES a few weeks ago to give me some insight into how Cozmo works, plays, and learns, and how he’s different from other consumer robots you may know, such as the Roomba. We discuss the types of algorithms that help power Cozmo, such as facial detection and recognition, 3D pose recognition, reasoning, and even some simple emotional AI. We also cover Cozmo’s functionality and programmability, including a cool feature called Code Lab. This was a really fun interview, and you’ll be happy to know there’s a companion video starring Cozmo himself right here: https://youtu.be/jUkacU1I0QI. Be sure to check out some of the great names that will be at the AI Conference in New York, Apr 29–May 2, where you'll join the leading minds in AI, Peter Norvig, George Church, Olga Russakovsky, Manuela Veloso, and Zoubin Ghahramani.

      <description>In this episode i'm joined by Inmar Givoni, Autonomy Engineering Manager at Uber ATG, to discuss her work on the paper Min-Max Propagation, which was presented at NIPS last month in Long Beach. Inmar and I get into a meaty discussion about graphical models, including what they are and how they’re used, some of the challenges they present for both training and inference, and how and where they can be best applied. Then we jump into an in-depth look at the key ideas behind the Min-Max Propagation paper itself, including the relationship to the broader domain of belief propagation and ideas like affinity propagation, and how all these can be applied to a use case example like the makespan problem. This was a really fun conversation! Enjoy!

      <description>In this episode I speak with Tuomas Sandholm, Carnegie Mellon University Professor and Founder and CEO of startups Optimized Markets and Strategic Machine. Tuomas, along with his PhD student Noam Brown, won a 2017 NIPS Best Paper award for their paper “Safe and Nested Subgame Solving for Imperfect-Information Games.” Tuomas and I dig into the significance of the paper, including a breakdown of perfect vs imperfect information games, the role of abstractions in game solving, and how the concept of safety applies to gameplay. We discuss how all these elements and techniques are applied to poker, and how the algorithm described in this paper was used by Noam and Tuomas to create Libratus, the first AI to beat top human pros in No Limit Texas Hold’em, a particularly difficult game to beat due to its large state space. This was a fascinating interview that I'm really excited to share with you all. Enjoy!

      <title>Separating Vocals in Recorded Music at Spotify with Eric Humphrey - TWiML Talk #98</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/386021459-twiml-twiml-talk-98-separating-vocals-recorded-music-spotify-eric-humphrey.mp3</link>
      <description>In today’s show, I sit down with Eric Humphrey, Research Scientist in the music understanding group at Spotify. Eric was at the Deep Learning Summit to give a talk on Advances in Deep Architectures and Methods for Separating Vocals in Recorded Music. We discuss his talk, including how Spotify's large music catalog enables such an experiment to even take place, the methods they use to train algorithms to isolate and remove vocals from music, and how architectures like U-Net and Pix2Pix come into play when building his algorithms. We also hit on the idea of “creative AI,” Spotify’s attempt at understanding music content at scale, optical music recognition, and more. This show is part of a series of shows recorded at the RE•WORK Deep Learning Summit in Montreal back in October. This was a great event and, in fact, their next event, the Deep Learning Summit San Francisco is right around the corner on January 25th and 26th, and will feature more leading researchers and technologists like the ones you’ll hear here on the show this week, including Ian Goodfellow of Google Brain, Daphne Koller of Calico Labs, and more!

      <description>In this show I speak with Greg Diamos, senior computer systems researcher at Baidu. Greg joined me before his talk at the Deep Learning Summit, where he spoke on “The Next Generation of AI Chips.” Greg’s talk focused on some work his team was involved in that accelerates deep learning training by using mixed 16-bit and 32-bit floating point arithmetic. We cover a ton of interesting ground in this conversation, and if you’re interested in systems level thinking around scaling and accelerating deep learning, you’re really going to like this one. And of course, if you like this one, you’re also going to like TWiML Talk #14 with Greg’s former colleague, Shubho Sengupta, which covers a bunch of related topics. This show is part of a series of shows recorded at the RE•WORK Deep Learning Summit in Montreal back in October.

      <description>In this episode, we hear from David Duvenaud, assistant professor in the Computer Science and Statistics departments at the University of Toronto. David joined me after his talk at the Deep Learning Summit on “Composing Graphical Models With Neural Networks for Structured Representations and Fast Inference.” In our conversation, we discuss the generalized modeling and inference framework that David and his team have created, which combines the strengths of both probabilistic graphical models and deep learning methods. He gives us a walkthrough of his use case which is to automatically segment and categorize mouse behavior from raw video, and we discuss how the framework is applied here and for other use cases. We also discuss some of the differences between the frequentist and bayesian statistical approaches. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/96</description>

      <description>In this episode we hear from Siddha Ganju, data scientist at computer vision startup Deep Vision. Siddha joined me at the AI Conference a while back to chat about the challenges of developing deep learning applications “at the edge,” i.e. those targeting compute- and power-constrained environments.In our conversation, Siddha provides an overview of Deep Vision’s embedded processor, which is optimized for ultra-low power requirements, and we dig into the data processing pipeline and network architecture process she uses to support sophisticated models in embedded devices. We dig into the specific the hardware and software capabilities and restrictions typical of edge devices and how she utilizes techniques like model pruning and compression to create embedded models that deliver needed performance levels in resource constrained environments, and discuss use cases such as facial recognition, scene description and activity recognition. Siddha's research interests also include natural language processing and visual question answering, and we spend some time discussing the latter as well.</description>

      <itunes:summary>In this episode we hear from Siddha Ganju, data scientist at computer vision startup Deep Vision. Siddha joined me at the AI Conference a while back to chat about the challenges of developing deep learning applications “at the edge,” i.e. those targeting compute- and power-constrained environments.In our conversation, Siddha provides an overview of Deep Vision’s embedded processor, which is optimized for ultra-low power requirements, and we dig into the data processing pipeline and network architecture process she uses to support sophisticated models in embedded devices. We dig into the specific the hardware and software capabilities and restrictions typical of edge devices and how she utilizes techniques like model pruning and compression to create embedded models that deliver needed performance levels in resource constrained environments, and discuss use cases such as facial recognition, scene description and activity recognition. Siddha's research interests also include natural language processing and visual question answering, and we spend some time discussing the latter as well.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Neuroevolution: Evolving Novel Neural Network Architectures with Kenneth Stanley - TWiML Talk #94</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/381801650-twiml-twiml-talk-94-neuroevolution-evolving-novel-neural-network-architectures-kenneth-stanley.mp3</link>
      <description>Today, I'm joined by Kenneth Stanley, Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida and senior research scientist at Uber AI Labs. Kenneth studied under TWiML Talk #47 guest Risto Miikkulainen at UT Austin, and joined Uber AI Labs after Geometric Intelligence, the company he co-founded with Gary Marcus and others, was acquired in late 2016. Kenneth’s research focus is what he calls Neuroevolution, applies the idea of genetic algorithms to the challenge of evolving neural network architectures. In this conversation, we discuss the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (or NEAT) paper that Kenneth authored along with Risto, which won the 2017 International Society for Artificial Life’s Award for Outstanding Paper of the Decade 2002 - 2012. We also cover some of the extensions to that approach he’s created since, including, HyperNEAT, which can efficiently evolve very large networks with connectivity patterns that look more like those of the human and that are generally much larger than what prior approaches to neural learning could produce, and novelty search, an approach which unlike most evolutionary algorithms has no defined objective, but rather simply searches for novel behaviors. We also cover concepts like “Complexification” and “Deception”, biology vs computation including differences and similarities, and some of his other work including his book, and NERO, a video game complete with Real-time Neuroevolution. This is a meaty “Nerd Alert” interview that I think you’ll really enjoy.</description>

      <description>Today, I'm joined by Davide Venturelli, science operations manager and quantum computing team lead for the Universities Space Research Association’s Institute for Advanced Computer Science at NASA Ames. Davide joined me backstage at the NYU Future Labs AI Summit a while back to give me some insight into a topic that I’ve been curious about for some time now, quantum computing. We kick off our discussion about the core ideas behind quantum computing, including what it is, how it’s applied and the ways it relates to computing as we know it today. We discuss the practical state of quantum computers and what their capabilities are, and the kinds of things you can do with them. And of course, we explore the intersection between AI and quantum computing, how quantum computing may one day accelerate machine learning, and how interested listeners can get started down the quantum rabbit hole.

      <description>This week on the podcast we’re featuring a series of conversations from the NIPs conference in Long Beach, California. I attended a bunch of talks and learned a ton, organized an impromptu roundtable on Building AI Products, and met a bunch of great people, including some former TWiML Talk guests. In this episode I speak with Yael Niv, professor of neuroscience and psychology at Princeton University. Yael joined me after her invited talk on “Learning State Representations.” In this interview Yael and I explore the relationship between neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, we discusses the importance of state representations in human learning, some of her experimental results in this area, and how a better understanding of representation learning can lead to insights into machine learning problems such as reinforcement and transfer learning. Did I mention this was a nerd alert show? I really enjoyed this interview and I know you will too.

Matthew joined me after the NIPS Symposium of the same name, an event that brought researchers from a variety of disciplines together towards three aims: a broader perspective of the possible types of intelligence beyond human intelligence, better measurements of intelligence, and a more purposeful analysis of where progress should be made in AI to best benefit society. Matthew’s research explores intelligence from a philosophical perspective, exploring ideas like predictive processing and controlled hallucination, and how these theories of intelligence impact the way we approach creating artificial intelligence. This was a very interesting conversation, i'm sure you’ll enjoy.</description>

I attended a bunch of talks and learned a ton, organized an impromptu roundtable on Building AI Products, and met a bunch of great people, including some former TWiML Talk guests. In this episode i'm joined by Sara Jennings, Timothy Seabrook and Andres Rodriguez to discuss NASA’s Frontier Development Lab or FDL. The FDL is an intense 8-week applied AI research accelerator, focused on tackling knowledge gaps useful to the space program. In our discussion, Sara, producer at the FDL, provides some insight into its goals and structure. Timothy, a researcher at FDL, describes his involvement with the program, including some of the projects he worked on while on-site. He also provides a look into some of this year’s FDL projects, including Planetary Defense, Solar Storm Prediction, and Lunar Water Location. Last but not least, Andres, Sr. Principal Engineer at Intel's AIPG, joins us to detail Intel’s support of the FDL, and how the various elements of the Intel AI stack supported the FDL research. This is a jam packed conversation, so be sure to check the show notes page at twimlai.com/talk/89 for all the links and tidbits from this episode.</description>

        <![CDATA[This week on the podcast we’re featuring a series of conversations from the NIPs conference in Long Beach, California. I attended a bunch of talks and learned a ton, organized an impromptu roundtable on Building AI Products, and met a bunch of great people, including some former TWiML Talk guests. In this episode i'm joined by Sara Jennings, Timothy Seabrook and Andres Rodriguez to discuss NASA’s Frontier Development Lab or FDL.

      <description>This week on the podcast we’re featuring a series of conversations from the NIPs conference in Long Beach, California. I attended a bunch of talks and learned a ton, organized an impromptu roundtable on Building AI Products, and met a bunch of great people, including some former TWiML Talk guests. In this episode I sit down with Timnit Gebru, postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research in the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in AI, or FATE, group. Timnit is also one of the organizers behind the Black in AI group, which held a very interesting symposium and poster session at NIPS. I’ll link to the group’s page in the show notes. I’ve been following Timnit’s work for a while now and was really excited to get a chance to sit down with her and pick her brain. We packed a ton into this conversation, especially keying in on her recently released paper “Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US”. Timnit describes the pipeline she developed for this research, and some of the challenges she faced building and end-to-end model based on google street view images, census data and commercial car vendor data. We also discuss the role of social awareness in her work, including an explanation of how domain adaptation and fairness are related and her view of the major research directions in the domain of fairness.

      <description>This week on the podcast we’re featuring a series of conversations from the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. I had a great time at this event getting caught up on the latest and greatest machine learning and AI products and services announced by AWS and its partners. Today we’re joined by Aaron Ames, Professor of Mechanical &amp; Civil Engineering at Caltech. Aaron joined me before his talk at the Deep Learning Summit “Eye, Robot: Computer Vision and Autonomous Robotics” and I had a ton of questions for him. While he considers himself a “hardware guy”, we got into a great discussion centered around the intersection of Robotics and ML Inference. We cover a range of topics, including Boston Dynamics backflipping robot (If you haven't seen it, check out the show notes), Humanoid Robotics, His work on motion primitives and transitions and he even gives us a few predictions on the future of robotics.</description>

I had a great time at this event getting caught up on the latest and greatest machine learning and AI products and services announced by AWS and its partners. In this episode we’re joined by Chris Adzima, Senior Information Analyst for the Washington County Sheriff’s Department. While Chris is not a traditional data scientist, he comes to us with a very interesting use case using AWS’s Rekognition. Chris is using Rekognition to identify suspects in the Portland area by running their mugshots through the software. In our conversation, he details how he is using Rekognition, while giving us few use cases along the way. We discuss how bias affects the work he is doing, and how they try to remove it from their process, not only from a software developer standpoint, but from a law enforcement standpoint and what his next steps are with the Rekognition software. This was a pretty interesting discussion, i’m sure you’ll enjoy it!</description>

I had a great time at this event getting caught up on the latest and greatest machine learning and AI products and services announced by AWS and its partners. This time around we’re joined by Kristen Grauman, a professor in the department of computer science at UT Austin. Kristen specializes in Computer Vision and joined me leading up to her talk at the Deep Learning Summit “Learning where to look in video”. Kristen &amp; I cover the details from her talk, like exploring how a vision system can learn how to move and where to look. Kristen considers how an embodied vision system can internalize the link between “how I move” and “what I see”, explore policies for learning to look around actively, and learn to mimic human videographer tendencies, automatically deciding where to look in unedited 360 degree video.

I had a great time at this event getting caught up on the latest and greatest machine learning and AI products and services announced by AWS and its partners. If you missed the news coming out of re:Invent and want to know more about what one of the biggest AI platform providers is up to, you’ll want to say tuned, because we’ll discuss many of their new offerings in this episode, a Roundtable discussion I held with Dave McCrory VP of Software Engineering at Wise.io at GE Digital and Lawrence Chung, engagement lead at ThingLogix. We cover all of AWS’ most important news, including the new SageMaker and DeepLens, their Rekognition and Transcription services, Alexa for Business, GreenGrass ML and more. This kind of discussion is something a little new for the show, and is a bit reminiscent of my days covering news here on the podcast, so I hope you enjoy it!</description>

We cover all of AWS’ most important news, including the new SageMaker and DeepLens, their Rekognition and Transcription services, Alexa for Business, GreenGrass ML and more. This kind of discussion is something a little new for the show, and is a bit reminiscent of my days covering news here on the podcast, so I hope you enjoy it!</itunes:summary>

      <title>Driving Customer Loyalty with Predictive and Conversational AI with Sherif Mityas - TWiML Talk #82</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/366890267-twiml-twiml-talk-82-driving-customer-loyalty-predictive-conversational-ai-sherif-mityas.mp3</link>
      <description>This week on the podcast we’re running a series of shows consisting of conversations with some of the impressive speakers from an event called the AI Summit in New York City. The theme of the conference, and the series, is AI in the Enterprise, and I think you’ll find it really interesting in that it includes a mix of both technical and case-study-oriented discussions. To close out our AI Summit New York Series, I speak with Sherif Mityas, head of Technology, Digital and Strategy at restaurant chain TGI Fridays. Sherif joins us to discuss how Fridays is utilizing conversational AI to enhance customer loyalty. Sherif wants Friday’s to be known as a tech company that happens to sell burgers and beer, and in this conversation we get an in-depth look at the technology landscape they’ve put in place to move the company in this direction. Sherif also shares some of the things on the horizon for Friday’s, as well as some of what they’ve learned along the way. Be sure to share your feedback or questions on the show notes page, which you’ll find at twimlai.com/talk/82.</description>

The theme of the conference, and the series, is AI in the Enterprise, and I think you’ll find it really interesting in that it includes a mix of both technical and case-study-oriented discussions. Today’s show continues our discussion of enterprise AI, with a conversation with Thierry Derungs, Chief Digital Officer at BNP Paribas, a multinational bank headquartered in Paris. Thierry joined me to discuss how BNP uses AI and some of the opportunities that have arisen with the changing AI landscape. We also discuss the innovation process that BNP has used to introduce AI to the bank, via what they call innovation incubators or “factories”.

      <title>Block-Sparse Kernels for Deep Neural Networks with Durk Kingma - TWiML Talk #80</title>

      <description>The show is part of a series that I’m really excited about, in part because I’ve been working to bring them to you for quite a while now. The focus of the series is a sampling of the interesting work being done over at OpenAI, the independent AI research lab founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others. In this show I’m joined by Jonas Schneider, Robotics Technical Team Lead at OpenAI. This episode features Durk Kingma, a Research Scientist at OpenAI. Although Durk is probably best known for his pioneering work on variational autoencoders, he joined me this time to talk through his latest project on block sparse kernels, which OpenAI just published this week. Block sparsity is a property of certain neural network representations, and OpenAI’s work on developing block sparse kernels helps make it more computationally efficient to take advantage of them. In addition to covering block sparse kernels themselves and the background required to understand them, we also discuss why they’re important and walk through some examples of how they can be used. I’m happy to present another fine Nerd Alert show to close out this OpenAI Series, and I know you’ll enjoy it!

The theme of the conference, and the series, is AI in the Enterprise, and I think you’ll find it really interesting in that it includes a mix of both technical and case-study-oriented discussions. My guest for this first show in the series is, Hillery Hunter, IBM Fellow &amp; Director of the Accelerated Cognitive Infrastructure group at IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center. Hillery and I met a few weeks back in New York and I'm really glad that we were able to get her on the show. Hillery joins us to discuss her team's research into distributed deep learning, which was recently released as the PowerAI Distributed Deep Learning Communication Library or DDL. In my conversation with Hillery, we discuss the purpose and technical architecture of the DDL, it’s ability to offer fully synchronous distributed training of deep learning models, the advantages of its Multi-Ring Topology, and much more. This is for sure a nerd alert pod, especially for the performance and hardware geeks among us .

In my conversation with Hillery, we discuss the purpose and technical architecture of the DDL, it’s ability to offer fully synchronous distributed training of deep learning models, the advantages of its Multi-Ring Topology, and much more. This is for sure a nerd alert pod, especially for the performance and hardware geeks among us . Be sure post any feedback or questions you may have to the show notes page, which you’ll find at twimlai.com/talk/77. For more info on this series, visit twimlai.com/aisummit</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>This week on the podcast we’re running a series of shows consisting of conversations with some of the impressive speakers from an event called the AI Summit in New York City. The theme of the conference, and the series, is AI in the Enterprise, and I think you’ll find it really interesting in that it includes a mix of both technical and case-study-oriented discussions. My guest for this first show in the series is, Hillery Hunter, IBM Fellow &amp; Director of the Accelerated Cognitive Infrastructure group at IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center.

      <title>Robotics at OpenAI with Jonas Schneider - TWiML Talk #76</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/363577697-twiml-twiml-talk-76-robotics-openai-jonas-schneider.mp3</link>
      <description>The show is part of a series that I’m really excited about, in part because I’ve been working to bring them to you for quite a while now. The focus of the series is a sampling of the interesting work being done over at OpenAI, the independent AI research lab founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others. In this show I’m joined by Jonas Schneider, Robotics Technical Team Lead at OpenAI. While in San Francisco a few months ago, I spent some time with Jonas at the OpenAI office, during which we covered a lot of interesting ground around OpenAI’s work in robotics. We discuss OpenAI Gym, which was the first project he worked on at OpenAI, as well as how they approach setting up the infrastructure for their experimental work, including how they’ve set up a Robots-as-a-Service environment for their researchers and how they use the open source Kubernetes project to manage their compute environment.

      <description>This week, we’ll be featuring a series of shows recorded from Strange Loop, a great developer-focused conference that takes place every year right in my backyard! The conference is a multi-disciplinary melting pot of developers and thinkers across a variety of fields, and we’re happy to be able to bring a bit of it to those of you who couldn’t make it in person! In this episode, I speak with Sam Ritchie, a software engineer at Stripe. I caught up with Sam RIGHT after his talk at the conference, where he covered his team’s work on explaining black box predictions. In our conversation, we discuss how Stripe uses black box predictions for fraud detection, and he gives a few use case scenarios. We discuss Stripe’s approach for explaining those predictions as well as other approaches, and briefly mention Carlos Guestrin’s work on LIME paper, which he and I discuss in TWiML Talk #7.

The conference is a multi-disciplinary melting pot of developers and thinkers across a variety of fields, and we’re happy to be able to bring a bit of it to those of you who couldn’t make it in person! In this episode, I speak with Matthew Taylor, Open Source Manager at Numenta. You might remember hearing a bit about Numenta from an interview I did with Francisco Weber of Cortical.io, for TWiML Talk #10, a show which remains the most popular show on the podcast. Numenta is basically trying to reverse-engineer the neocortex, and use what they learn to develop a neocortical theory for biological and machine intelligence called Hierarchical Temporal Memory. Matt joined me at the conference to discuss his talk “The Biological Path Towards Strong AI”. In our conversation, we discuss the basics of HTM, it’s biological inspiration, and how it differs from traditional neural network models including deep learning. This is a Nerd Alert show, and after you listen I would encourage you to check out the conversation with Francisco which we’ll link to in the show notes.

      <itunes:summary>This week, we’ll be featuring a series of shows recorded from Strange Loop, a great developer-focused conference that takes place every year right in my backyard! The conference is a multi-disciplinary melting pot of developers and thinkers across a variety of fields, and we’re happy to be able to bring a bit of it to those of you who couldn’t make it in person! In this episode, I speak with Matthew Taylor, Open Source Manager at Numenta. You might remember hearing a bit about Numenta from an interview I did with Francisco Weber of Cortical.io, for TWiML Talk #10, a show which remains the most popular show on the podcast. Numenta is basically trying to reverse-engineer the neocortex, and use what they learn to develop a neocortical theory for biological and machine intelligence called Hierarchical Temporal Memory. Matt joined me at the conference to discuss his talk “The Biological Path Towards Strong AI”. In our conversation, we discuss the basics of HTM, it’s biological inspiration, and how it differs from traditional neural network models including deep learning. This is a Nerd Alert show, and after you listen I would encourage you to check out the conversation with Francisco which we’ll link to in the show notes. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/71 For series information, visit twimlai.com/stloop</itunes:summary>

      <description>We close out our NYU Future Labs AI Summit interview series with Ross Fadely, a New York based AI lead with Insight Data Science. Insight is an interesting company offering a free seven week post-doctoral training fellowship helping individuals to bridge the gap between academia and careers in data science, data engineering and AI. Ross joined me backstage at the Future Labs Summit after leading a Machine Learning Primer for attendees. Our conversation explores some of the knowledge gaps that Insight has identified in folks coming out of academia, and how they structure their program to address them. If you find yourself looking to make this transition, you’ll definitely want to check out this episode.

      <title>The Limitations of Human-in-the-Loop AI with Dennis Mortensen - TWiML Talk #67</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/355168010-twiml-twiml-talk-67-limitations-human-loop-ai-dennis-mortensen.mp3</link>
      <description>We continue our NYU Future Labs AI Summit interview series with Dennis Mortensen, founder and CEO of X.ai, a company whose AI-based personal assistant Amy helps users with scheduling meetings. I caught up with Dennis backstage at the Future Labs event a few weeks ago, right before he went on stage to talk about “Investing in AI from the Startup POV.” Dennis gave shares some great insight into building an AI-first company, not to mention his vision for the future of scheduling, something no one actually enjoys doing, and his thoughts on the future of human-AI interaction. This was a fun interview, which I’m sure you’ll enjoy. A quick warning though… This might not be a show to listen to in the car with the kiddos, as this episode does contain a few expletives.

      <description>The podcast you’re about to hear is the second of a series of shows recorded at the NYU Future Labs AI Summit last week in New York City.In this episode, you’ll hear from Bite.ai, a startup founded by Vinay Anantharaman and Michal Wolski, founders who met working at Clarifai, another NYU Future Labs alumni, whose CEO Matt Zeiler I interviewed on TWiML Talk #22(Link on show notes page). Bite is using convolutional neural networks and other machine learning to help computers understand and reason about food. Their product is the app Bitesnap, which provides users with detailed nutritional information about the food they’re about to eat using just a photo and a serving size. We dive into the details of their app and service, the machine learning models and pipeline that enable it, and how they plan to compete with other apps targeting dieters, and more!

      <description>The podcast you’re about to hear is the second of a series of shows recorded at the NYU Future Labs AI Summit last week in New York City. In this episode, I speak with Ron Fisher and Mike Wang, who, along with Vivek Sudarsan founded Bowtie Labs, a 24/7 AI-based receptionist designed to help businesses in the beauty, wellness, and fitness industries increase retail conversion rates. I’ve talked with a few startups in the conversational space recently and one common theme seems to be quickly outgrowing commercial conversational platforms. Ron and Mike shared their own experiences with decision, and shared some of the challenges they’re trying to overcome with their ML models, as well as some of the techniques they use to make their system as responsive as possible.

      <description>The podcast you’re about to hear is the first of a series of shows recorded at the Georgian Partners Portfolio Conference last week in Toronto. My guest for this show is Solmaz Shahalizadeh, Director of Merchant Services Algorithms at Shopify. Solmaz gave a great talk at the GPPC focused on her team’s experiences applying machine learning to fight fraud and improve merchant satisfaction. Solmaz and I dig into, step-by-step, the process they used to transition from a legacy, rules-based fraud detection system system to a more scalable, flexible one based on machine learning models. We discuss the importance of well-defined project scope; tips and traps when selecting features to train your models; and the various models, transformations and pipelines the Shopify team selected; and how they use PMML to make their Python models available to their Ruby-on-Rails web application.

      <title>Perception Models for Self-Driving Cars with Jianxiong Xiao - TWiML Talk #58</title>

      <description>We are back with our second show this week, episode 2 of our Autonomous Vehicles Series. This time around we are joined by Jianxiong Xiao of AutoX, a company building computer vision centric solutions for autonomous vehicles. Jianxiong, a PhD graduate of MIT’s CSAIL Lab, joins me to discuss the different layers of the autonomous vehicle stack and the models for machine perception currently used in self-driving cars. If you’re new to the autonomous vehicles space I’m confident you’ll learn a ton, and even if you know the space in general, you’ll get a glimpse into why Jianxiong thinks AutoX’s direct perception approach is superior to end-to-end processing or mediated perception.

      <description>The episode you are about to hear is the first of a new series of shows on Autonomous Vehicles. We all know that self-driving cars is one of the hottest topics in ML &amp; AI, so we had to dig a little deeper into the space. To get us started on this journey, I’m excited to present this interview with Daryn Nakhuda, CEO and Co-Founder of MightyAI. Daryn and I discuss the many challenges of collecting training data for autonomous vehicles, along with some thoughts on human-powered insights and annotation, semantic segmentation, and a ton more great stuff.

      <description>As you all know, a few weeks ago, I spent some time in SF at the Artificial Intelligence Conference. I sat down with James Guszcza, US Chief Data Scientist at Deloitte Consulting to talk about human factors in machine intelligence. James was in San Francisco to give a talk at the O’Reilly AI Conference on “Why AI needs human-centered design.” We had an amazing chat, in which we explored the many reasons why the human element is so important in ML and AI, along with useful ways to build algorithms and models that reflect this human element, while avoiding out problems like group-think and bias. This was a very interesting conversation. I enjoyed it a ton, and I’m sure you will too! The notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/talk/56</description>

      <description>As you all know, a few weeks ago, I spent some time in SF at the Artificial Intelligence Conference. While I was there, I had just enough time to sneak away and catch up with Scott Clark, Co-Founder and CEO of Sigopt, a company whose software is focused on automatically tuning your model’s parameters through Bayesian optimization. We dive pretty deeply into that process through the course of this discussion, while hitting on topics like Exploration vs Exploitation, Bayesian Regression, Heterogeneous Configuration Models and Covariance Kernels. I had a great time and learned a ton, but be forewarned, this is most definitely a Nerd Alert show! Notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/50</description>

      <itunes:summary>As you all know, a few weeks ago, I spent some time in SF at the Artificial Intelligence Conference. While I was there, I had just enough time to sneak away and catch up with Scott Clark, Co-Founder and CEO of Sigopt, a company whose software is focused on automatically tuning your model’s parameters through Bayesian optimization. We dive pretty deeply into that process through the course of this discussion, while hitting on topics like Exploration vs Exploitation, Bayesian Regression, Heterogeneous Configuration Models and Covariance Kernels. I had a great time and learned a ton, but be forewarned, this is most definitely a Nerd Alert show! Notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/50</itunes:summary>

      <title>Symbolic and Sub-Symbolic Natural Language Processing with Jonathan Mugan - TWiML Talk #49</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/344008076-twiml-twiml-talk-049-symbolic-sub-symbolic-natural-language-processing-jonathan-mugan.mp3</link>
      <description>Like last week’s interview with Bruno Goncalves, this week’s interview was also recorded at the last O’Reilly AI Conference back in New York in June. Also like last week’s show, this week’s is also focused on Natural Language Processing and I think you’ll enjoy it. I’m joined by Jonathan Mugan, co-founder and CEO of Deep Grammar, a company that is building a grammar checker using deep learning and what they call deep symbolic processing. This interview is a great complement to my conversation with Bruno, and we cover a variety of topics from both the sub-symbolic and symbolic schools of NLP, such as attention mechanisms like sequence to sequence, and ontological approaches like WordNet, synsets, FrameNet, and SUMO.

      <description>This week i'm bringing you an interview from Bruno Goncalves, a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at NYU. As you’ll hear in the interview, Bruno is a longtime listener of the podcast. We were able to connect at the NY AI conference back in June after I noted on a previous show that I was interested in learning more about word2vec. Bruno graciously agreed to come on the show and walk us through an overview of word embeddings, word2vec and related ideas. He provides a great overview of not only word2vec, related NLP concepts such as Skip Gram, Continuous Bag of Words, Node2Vec and TFIDF. Notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/48.</description>

      <description>My guest this week is Risto Miikkulainen, professor of computer science at UT-Austin and vice president of Research at Sentient Technologies. Risto came locked and loaded to discuss a topic that we've received a ton of requests for -- evolutionary algorithms. During our talk we discuss some of the things Sentient is working on in the financial services and retail fields, and we dig into the technology behind it, evolutionary algorithms, which is also the focus of Risto’s research at UT. I really enjoyed this interview and learned a ton, and I’m sure you will too! Notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/47.</description>

      <title>Agile Machine Learning with Jennifer Prendki - TWiML Talk #46</title>

      <description>My guest this week is Jennifer Prendki. That name might sound familiar, as she was one of the great speakers from my Future of Data Summit back in May. At the time, Jennifer was senior data science manager and principal data scientist at Walmart Labs, but she's since moved on to become head of data science at Atlassian. Back at the summit, Jennifer gave an awesome talk on what she calls Data Mixology, the slides for which you can find on the show notes page. My conversation with Jennifer begins with a recap of that talk. After that, we shift our focus to some of the practices she helped develop and implement at Walmart around the measurement and management of machine learning models in production, and more generally, building agile processes and teams for machine learning.

      <title>LSTMs, Plus a Deep Learning History Lesson with Jürgen Schmidhuber - TWiML Talk #44</title>

      <description>This week we have a very special interview to share with you! Those of you who’ve been receiving my newsletter for a while might remember that while in Switzerland last month, I had the pleasure of interviewing Jurgen Schmidhuber, in his lab IDSIA, which is the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research in Lugano, Switzerland, where he serves as Scientific Director. In addition to his role at IDSIA, Jurgen is also Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of NNaisense, a company that is using AI to build large-scale neural network solutions for “superhuman perception and intelligent automation.” Jurgen is an interesting, accomplished and in some circles controversial figure in the AI community and we covered a lot of very interesting ground in our discussion, so much so that I couldn't truly unpack it all until I had a chance to sit with it after the fact. We talked a bunch about his work on neural networks, especially LSTM’s, or Long Short-Term Memory networks, which are a key innovation behind many of the advances we’ve seen in deep learning and its application over the past few years. Along the way, Jurgen walks us through a deep learning history lesson that spans 50+ years. It was like walking back in time with the 3 eyed raven. I know you’re really going to enjoy this one, and by the way, this is definitely a nerd alert show! For the show notes, visit twimlai.com/talk/44</description>

      <description>Today’s show, which concludes the first season of the Industrial AI Series, features my interview with Bonsai co-founder and CEO Mark Hammond. I sat down with Mark at Bonsai HQ a few weeks ago and we had a great discussion while I was there. We touched on a ton of subjects throughout this talk, including his starting point in Artificial intelligence, how Bonsai came about &amp; more. Mark also describes the role of what he calls “machine teaching” in delivering practical machine learning solutions, particularly for enterprise or industrial AI use cases. This was one of my favorite conversations, I know you’ll enjoy it! The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/43</description>

      <description>Recently I had a chance to catch up with a friend and friend of the show, Josh Bloom, vice president of data &amp; analytics at GE Digital. If you’ve been listening for a while, you already know that Josh was on the show around this time last year, just prior to the acquisition of his company Wise.io by GE Digital. It was great to catch up with Josh on his journey within GE, and the work his team is doing around Industrial AI, now that they’re part of the one of the world’s biggest industrial companies. We talk about some really interesting things in this show, including how his team is using autoencoders to create training datasets, and how they incorporate knowledge of physics and physical systems into their machine learning models. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/42.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Recently I had a chance to catch up with a friend and friend of the show, Josh Bloom, vice president of data &amp; analytics at GE Digital. If you’ve been listening for a while, you already know that Josh was on the show around this time last year, just prior to the acquisition of his company Wise.io by GE Digital. It was great to catch up with Josh on his journey within GE, and the work his team is doing around Industrial AI, now that they’re part of the one of the world’s biggest industrial companies. We talk about some really interesting things in this show, including how his team is using autoencoders to create training datasets, and how they incorporate knowledge of physics and physical systems into their machine learning models.

      <title>Data Pipelines at Zymergen with Airflow with Erin Shellman - TWiML Talk #41</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/336865372-twiml-twiml-talk-041-erin-shellman-data-pipelines-at-zymergen-with-airflow.mp3</link>
      <description>The show you’re listening to features my interview with Erin Shellman. Erin is a statistician and data science manager with Zymergen, a company using robots and machine learning to engineer better microbes. If you’re wondering what exactly that means, I was too, and we talk about it in the interview. Our conversation focuses on Zymergen’s use of Apache Airflow, an open-source data management platform originating at Airbnb, that Erin and her team uses to create reliable, repeatable data pipelines for its machine learning applications. A quick note before we dive in: As is the case with my other field recordings, there’s a bit of unavoidable background noise in this interview. Sorry about that!

      <title>Cognitive Biases in Data Science with Drew Conway - TWiML Talk #39</title>

      <description>This show features my interview with Drew Conway, whose Wrangle keynote could have been called “Confessions of a CIA Data Scientist.” The focus of our interview, and of Drew’s presentation, is an interesting set of observations he makes about the role of cognitive biases in data science. If your work involves making decisions or influencing behavior based on data-driven analysis--and it probably does or will--you’re going to want to hear what he has to say.

      <description>The show you’re about to listen to features my interview with Sharath Rao, Tech Lead Manager &amp; Machine Learning Engineer at Instacart I reached out to Sharath about being on the show and was blown away when he replied that not only had he heard about the show, but that he was a fan and an avid listener. My conversation with him digs into some of the practical lessons and patterns he’s learned by building production-ready, web-scale data products based on machine learning models, including the search and recommendation systems at Instacart. We also spend a few minutes discussing our upcoming TWiML Paper Reading Meetup!

      <description>This week we continue our Industrial AI series with Sergey Levine, an Assistant Professor at UC Berkeley whose research focus is Deep Robotic Learning. Sergey is part of the same research team as a couple of our previous guests in this series, Chelsea Finn and Pieter Abbeel, and if the response we’ve seen to those shows is any indication, you’re going to love this episode! Sergey’s research interests, and our discussion, focus in on include how robotic learning techniques can be used to allow machines to acquire autonomously acquire complex behavioral skills. We really dig into some of the details of how this is done and I found that our conversation filled in a lot of gaps for me from the interviews with Pieter and Chelsea. By the way, this is definitely a nerd alert episode! Notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/37</description>

      <title>The Power Of Probabilistic Programming with Ben Vigoda - TWiML Talk #33</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/332532588-twiml-twiml-talk-033-ben-vigoda-power-probabilistic-programming.mp3</link>
      <description>My guest for this third episode in the O'Reilly AI series is Ben Vigoda. Ben is the founder and CEO of Gamalon, a DARPA-funded startup working on Bayesian Program Synthesis. We dive into what exactly this means and how it enables what Ben calls idea learning in the show. Gamalon's first application structures unstructured data — input a paragraph or phrase of unstructured text and output a structured spreadsheet/database row or API call. This can be applicable to a wide range of data challenges, including enterprise product and customer information, AI or digital assistant, and many others. Before Gamalon, Ben was co-founder and CEO of Lyric Semiconductor, Inc., which created the first microprocessor architectures dedicated for statistical machine learning. The company was based on his PhD thesis at MIT and acquired by Analog Devices. In today’s talk we are discussing probabilistic programming, his new approach to deep learning, posterior distribution, and the difference between sampling methods and variational methods and how solvers work in the system. Nerd alert: We go pretty deep in this discussion.

      <itunes:summary>My guest for this third episode in the O'Reilly AI series is Ben Vigoda. Ben is the founder and CEO of Gamalon, a DARPA-funded startup working on Bayesian Program Synthesis. We dive into what exactly this means and how it enables what Ben calls idea learning in the show. Gamalon's first application structures unstructured data — input a paragraph or phrase of unstructured text and output a structured spreadsheet/database row or API call. This can be applicable to a wide range of data challenges, including enterprise product and customer information, AI or digital assistant, and many others. Before Gamalon, Ben was co-founder and CEO of Lyric Semiconductor, Inc., which created the first microprocessor architectures dedicated for statistical machine learning. The company was based on his PhD thesis at MIT and acquired by Analog Devices. In today’s talk we are discussing probabilistic programming, his new approach to deep learning, posterior distribution, and the difference between sampling methods and variational methods and how solvers work in the system. Nerd alert: We go pretty deep in this discussion.

      <title>Expressive AI - Generated Music With Google's Performance RNN - Doug Eck - TWiML Talk #32</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/332532595-twiml-twiml-talk-32-doug-eck-expressive-ai-generated-music-googles-performance-rnn.mp3</link>
      <description>My guest for this second show in our O’Reilly AI series is Doug Eck of Google Brain. Doug did a keynote at the O’Reilly conference on Magenta, Google’s project for melding machine learning and the arts. Magenta’s goal is to produce open-source tools and models that help people in their personal creative processes. Doug’s research starts with using so-called “generative” machine learning models to create engaging media. Additionally, he is working on how to bring other aspects of the creative process into play. We talk about the newly announced Performance RNN project, which uses neural networks to create expressive, AI-generated music. We also touch on QuickDraw, a project by Google AI Experiments, in which users as Doug describes it, “play Pictionary” with a visual classifier. We dig into what he foresees as possibilities for Magenta, machine learning models eventually developing storylines, generative models for media and creative coding.

      <title>Intel Nervana Update + Productizing AI Research with Naveen Rao And Hanlin Tang - TWiML Talk #31</title>

      <description>I talked about Intel’s acquisition of Nervana Systems on the podcast when it happened almost a year ago, so I was super excited to have an opportunity to sit down with Nervana co-founder Naveen Rao, who now leads Intel’s newly formed AI Products Group, for the first show in our O'Reilly AI series. We talked about how Intel plans to extend its leadership position in general purpose compute into the AI realm by delivering silicon designed specifically for AI, end-to-end solutions including the cloud, enterprise data center, and the edge; and tools that let customers quickly productize and scale AI-based solutions. I also spoke with Hanlin Tang, an algorithms engineer at Intel’s AIPG, about two tools announced at the conference: version 2.0 of Intel Nervana’s deep learning framework Neon and Nervana Graph, a new toolset for expressing and running deep learning applications as framework and hardware-independent computational graphs. Nervana Graph in particular sounds like a very interesting project, not to mention a smart move for Intel, and I’d encourage folks to take a look at their Github repo.

      <title>Enhancing Customer Experiences With Emotional AI with Rana El Kaliouby - TWiML Talk #35</title>

      <description>My guest for this show is Rana el Kaliouby. Rana is co-founder and CEO of Affectiva. Affectiva, as Rana puts it, "is on a mission to humanize technology by bringing in artificial emotional intelligence". If you liked my conversation about Emotional AI with Pascale Fung from last year’s O’Reilly AI conference, you’re going to love this one. My conversation with Rana kind of picks up where the previous one left off, with a focus on how her company is bringing Artificial Emotional Intelligence services to market. Rana and her team have developed a machine learning / computer vision platform that can use the camera on any device to read your facial expressions in real time, then maps it to an emotional state. Using data science to mine the world’s largest emotion repository, Affectiva has collected over 5.5 million pieces of emotional expression data to date, from laptop, driving, cellular interactions. Understanding the importance of personal privacy, Rana and her Co-Founder Rosalind Wright Picard have vowed to shy away from partnerships that would subject consumers to unknowing surveillance, a commendable effort.

      <title>Robotic Perception and Control with Chelsea Finn - TWiML Talk #29</title>

      <description>This week we continue our series on industrial applications of machine learning and AI with a conversation with Chelsea Finn, a PhD student at UC Berkeley. Chelsea’s research is focused on machine learning for robotic perception and control. Despite being early in her career, Chelsea is an accomplished researcher with more than 14 published papers in the past 2 years, on subjects like Deep Visual Foresight , Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning and Visuomotor Learning to name a few, all of which we discuss in the show, along with topics like zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot learning. I’d also like to give a shout out to Shreyas, a listener who wrote in to request that we interview a current PhD student about their journey and experiences. Chelsea and I spend some time at the end of the interview talking about this, and she has some great advice for current and prospective PhD students but also independent learners in the field. During this part of the discussion I wonder out loud if any listeners would be interested in forming a virtual paper reading club of some sort. I’m not sure yet exactly what this would look like, but please drop a comment in the show notes if you’re interested. I'm going to once again deploy the Nerd Alert for this episode; Chelsea and I really dig deep into these learning methods and techniques, and this conversation gets pretty technical at times, to the point that I had a tough time keeping up myself.

During this part of the discussion I wonder out loud if any listeners would be interested in forming a virtual paper reading club of some sort. I’m not sure yet exactly what this would look like, but please drop a comment in the show notes if you’re interested. I'm going to once again deploy the Nerd Alert for this episode; Chelsea and I really dig deep into these learning methods and techniques, and this conversation gets pretty technical at times, to the point that I had a tough time keeping up myself.

        <![CDATA[This week we continue our series on industrial applications of machine learning and AI with a conversation with Chelsea Finn, a PhD student at UC Berkeley. Chelsea’s research is focused on machine learning for robotic perception and control. Despite being early in her career, Chelsea is an accomplished researcher with more than 14 published papers in the past 2 years, on subjects like Deep Visual Foresight , Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning and Visuomotor Learning to name a few, all of which we discuss in the show, along with topics like zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot learning. I’d also like to give a shout out to Shreyas, a listener who wrote in to request that we interview a current PhD student about their journey and experiences.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Deep Dive with Pieter Abbeel - TWiML Talk #28</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/328458110-twiml-twiml-talk-028-reinforcement-learning-deep-dive-pieter-abbeel.mp3</link>
      <description>This week our guest is Pieter Abbeel, Assistant Professor at UC Berkeley, Research Scientist at OpenAI, and Cofounder of Gradescope. Pieter has an extensive background in AI research, going way back to his days as Andrew Ng’s first PhD student at Stanford. His research today is focused on deep learning for robotics. During this conversation, Pieter and I really dig into reinforcement learning, a technique for allowing robots (or AIs) to learn through their own trial and error. Nerd alert!! This conversation explores cutting edge research with one of the leading researchers in the field and, as a result, it gets pretty technical at times. I try to uplevel it when I can keep up myself, so hang in there. I promise that you’ll learn a ton if you keep with it. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/28</description>

      <description>I think you’re really going to enjoy today’s show. Our guest this week is Dominique Simmons, Applied research Scientist at AI tools vendor Dimensional Mechanics. Dominique brings an interesting background in Cognitive Psychology and psycholinguistics to her work and research in AI and, well, to this podcast. In our conversation, we cover the implications of cognitive psychology for neural networks and AI systems, and in particular how an understanding of human cognition impacts the development of AI models for media applications. We also discuss her research into multimodal training of AI models, and how our understanding of the human brain has influenced this work. We also explore the debate around the biological plausibility of machine learning and AI models. It was a great conversation. The show notes can be found at twimlai.com/talk/23.</description>

      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/321008876-twiml-twiml-talk-022-deep-neural-nets-visual-recognition-matt-zeiler-interview.mp3</link>
      <description>Today we bring you our final interview from backstage at the NYU FutureLabs AI Summit. Our guest this week is Matt Zeiler. Matt graduated from the University of Toronto where he worked with deep learning researcher Geoffrey Hinton and went on to earn his PhD in machine learning at NYU, home of Yann Lecun. In 2013 Matt’s founded Clarifai, a startup whose cloud-based visual recognition system gives developers a way to integrate visual identification into their own products, and whose initial image classification algorithm achieved top 5 results in that year’s ImageNet competition. I caught up with Matt after his talk “From Research to the Real World”. Our conversation focused on the birth and growth of Clarifai, as well as the underlying deep neural network architectures that enable it. If you’ve been listening to the show for a while, you’ve heard me ask several guests how they go about evolving the architectures of their deep neural networks to enhance performance. Well, in this podcast Matt gives the most satisfying answer I’ve received to date by far. Check it out. I think you’ll enjoy it. The show notes can be found at twimlai.com/talk/22.</description>

      <description>This week's guest is Kathryn Hume. Kathryn is the President of Fast Forward Labs, which is an independent machine intelligence research company that helps organizations accelerate their data science and machine intelligence capabilities. If Fast Forward Labs sounds familiar, that's because we had their founder, Hilary Mason on a few months ago. We’ll link to that in the show notes. My discussion with Kathryn focused on AI adoption within the enterprise. She shared several really interesting examples of the kinds of things she’s seeing enterprises do with machine learning and AI, and we discussed a few of the various challenges enterprises face and some of the lessons her company has learned in helping them. I really enjoyed our conversation and I know you will too! You can find the notes for todays show here: https://twimlai.com/talk/20</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Cybersecurity with Evan Wright - TWiML Talk #16</title>
      <link>https://chtbl.com/track/4D4ED/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/twimlai/314289546-twiml-twiml-talk-016-machine-learning-cybersecurity-evan-wright-interview.mp3</link>
      <description>This week my guest is Evan Wright, principal data scientist at cybersecurity startup Anomali. In my interview with Evan, he and I discussed about a number of topics surrounding the use of machine learning in cybersecurity. If Evan’s name sounds familiar, it’s because Evan was the winner of the O’Reilly Strata+Hadoop World ticket giveaway earlier this month. We met up at the conference last week and took advantage of the opportunity to record this show. Our conversation covers, among other topics, the three big problems in cybersecurity that ML can help out with, the challenges of acquiring ground truth in cybersecurity and some ways to accomplish it, and the use of decision trees, generative adversarial networks, and other algorithms in the field. The show notes can be found at twimlai.com/talk/16.</description>

      <description>My guest this time is Angie Hugeback, who is principal data scientist at Spare5. Spare5 helps customers generate the high-quality labeled training datasets that are so crucial to developing accurate machine learning models. In this show, Angie and I cover a ton of the real-world practicalities of generating training datasets. We talk through the challenges faced by folks that need to label training data, and how to develop a cohesive system for achieving performing the various labeling tasks you’re likely to encounter. We discuss some of the ways that bias can creep into your training data and how to avoid that. And we explore the some of the popular 3rd party options that companies look at for scaling training data production, and how they differ. Spare5 has graciously sponsored this episode; you can learn more about them at spare5.com. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/6.</description>

      <description>My guest this time is Charles Isbell, Jr., Professor and Senior Associate Dean in the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. Charles and I go back a bit… in fact he’s the first AI researcher I ever met. His research focus is what he calls “interactive artificial intelligence,” a discipline of AI focused specifically on the interactions between AIs and humans. We explore what this means and some of the interesting research results in this field. One part of this discussion I found particularly interesting was the intersection between his AI research and marketing and behavioral economics. Beyond his research, Charles is well known in the ML and AI worlds for his popular Machine Learning course sequence on Udacity, which he teaches with Brown University professor Michael Littman, and for the Online Master’s of Science in Computer Science program that he helped launch at Georgia Tech. We also spend quite a bit of time talking about what’s really missing in machine learning education and how to make it more accessible.

      <description>My guest this time is Xavier Amatriain. Xavier is a former researcher who went on to lead the machine learning recommendations team at Netflix, and is now the vice president of engineering at Quora, the Q&amp;A site. We spend quite a bit of time digging into each of these experiences in the interview. Here are just a few of the things we cover in our discussion: Why Netflix invested $1 million in the Netflix Prize, but didn’t use the winning solution; What goes into engineering practical machine learning systems; The problem Xavier has with the deep learning hype; And, what the heck is a multi-arm bandit and how can it help us.
