<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launched in 2011, Duolingo grew into the most downloaded education app in the world. By late 2024, it boasted 100 million monthly active users, 8 million paid subscribers, and a market capitalization approaching $15 billion. The success stemmed from a gamified approach to learning, use of adaptive AI technology, and alignment of incentives: maintaining a streak on the app not only helped users master a language but also drove subscription growth and reduced costs.</p>
<p>Duolingo had focused almost exclusively on language learning. But the company recognized the enormous potential of Gen AI to power innovative products, such as conversational language practice. Severin Hacker, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, envisioned a future in which AI would transform the app into an educational ecosystem that covered many subjects beyond language, allowing the company to tap into the $56 billion edtech market.</p>
<p>Duolingo had recently started to explore this direction by adding new subjects, such as math and music.

But it was also a seasonal business, which is a potential red flag.</p>

The shelter was operated in partnership with a nonprofit organization known as Mary’s Place and was designed to address what had become an urgent problem for Seattle and many other wealthy American cities, where communities were being displaced by a lack of affordable housing. Amazon’s partnership with Mary’s Place was an experiment in addressing this problem at its core, using some of the firm’s own resources to fund living space for unhoused families. But critics argued that Amazon’s apparent charity was misplaced because the company and other tech giants were actually making the problem worse.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, Apple debuted the iPhone 6S, which employed a default encryption system preventing both Apple and government authorities from accessing data stored on the device. Then, in 2016, a federal judge ordered Apple to provide technical assistance to unlock the iPhone used by one of the mass shooters in San Bernardino, California. Apple refused to comply.</p>
<p>Years later, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe in 2020, Apple and Google partnered to develop a contact tracing application that would collect information about users infected with the disease and notify those who they had been in contact with. The app would keep information about infection and contact private, but some governments wanted more access. When Apple and Google declined to provide this information, they sparked a debate about the companies&#8217; responsibilities for their customers&#8217; personal privacy versus public health.</p>
<p>Most recently, in September 2021, Apple decided to delay operating systems updates that included features to fight child sexual abuse. While many praised Apple, others worried that Apple&#8217;s new features risked undermining the privacy of all users.</p>
<p>As each of these situations unfolded, Apple CEO Tim Cook had to consider both his responsibilities to global governments and society, as well as to Apple&#8217;s customers, employees, and shareholders. Harvard Business School senior lecturer <strong>Henry McGee</strong> and professor <strong>Nien-h&#234; Hsieh</strong> discuss the tension between privacy and safety in their cases, &#8220;<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/apple-privacy-vs-safety-a/321004?sku=321004-PDF-ENG">Apple: Privacy vs. Safety</a>&#8221; (<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/apple-privacy-vs-safety-a/321004?fromSkuRelated=323066-PDF-ENG&#38;ab=store_idp_relatedpanel_-_apple_privacy_vs_safety_a_321004">A</a>), (<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/apple-privacy-vs-safety-b/323066?sku=323066-PDF-ENG">B</a>), and (<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/apple-privacy-vs-safety-c/324033?sku=324033-PDF-ENG">C</a>).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ra&#237;zen, a bioenergy company headquartered in S&#227;o Paulo, is Brazil&#8217;s leader in sugar and ethanol production and the world&#8217;s leading ethanol trader. Since its creation in 2011, the company had primarily produced first-generation ethanol (E1G) from sugarcane, a crop that can also be used to produce sugar.</p>
<p>In 2015, Ra&#237;zen also started to produce second-generation ethanol (E2G), a biofuel derived from residual and waste materials, such as cane bagasse and straw &#8211; which don&#8217;t compete with food production. The company&#8217;s growth strategy focused on developing and boosting a low carbon portfolio that focused on E2G, based on the belief that Ra&#237;zen&#8212;and Brazil&#8212;could help the world decarbonize and profit from the energy transition.</p>
<p><strong>Paula Kovarsky</strong>, Ra&#237;zen&#8217;s chief strategy and sustainability officer, was confident the company could become a global green energy champion. But after the board&#8217;s approval for the first round of E2G investments, she faced a complex challenge: how to expand the market for second-generation ethanol and other sugar-cane waste biofuels, in order to ensure Ra&#237;zen&#8217;s long-term growth.</p>
<p>Harvard Business School professor <strong>Gunnar Trumbull</strong> and Kovarsky discuss the company&#8217;s strategy for bringing second-generation ethanol to the world in the case, &#8220;<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65084">Ra&#237;zen: Helping to Decarbonize the World?</a>&#8221;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early 2023, the entertainment app TikTok reached close to one billion users globally, placing it fourth behind the leading social networks: Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s business model had focused on advertising as the principle source of revenue and by 2023, the app had become irresistible to many marketers. Meanwhile, competition in the market for short-form videos had intensified when Instagram introduced Reels and YouTube launched Shorts &#8211; innovations that imitated TikTok&#8217;s approach. In addition, YouTube had focused on using its larger scale and generous ad revenue sharing to attract creators.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late October 2022, Elon Musk officially took Twitter private and became the company&#8217;s majority shareholder, finally ending a months-long acquisition saga. He appointed himself CEO and brought in his own team to clean house.</p>
<p>Musk needed to take decisive steps to succeed against the major opposition to his leadership from both inside and outside the company. Twitter employees circulated an open letter protesting expected layoffs, advertising agencies advised their clients to pause spending on Twitter, and EU officials considered a broader Twitter ban. What short-term actions should Musk take to stabilize the situation, and how should he approach long-term strategy to turn around Twitter?</p>
<p>Harvard Business School assistant professor <strong>Andy Wu</strong> and co-author <strong>Goran Calic</strong>, associate professor at McMaster University&#8217;s DeGroote School of Business, discuss Twitter as a microcosm for the future of media and information in their case, &#8220;<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=63610">Twitter Turnaround and Elon Musk</a>.&#8221;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a Fortune 50 company in the drug distribution industry, agreed to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide against the company for its opioid distribution practices, which critics alleged had contributed to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The $6.6 billion global settlement caused a net loss larger than the cumulative net income earned during the tenure of the company&#8217;s CEO, which began in 2011.</p>
<p>In addition, AmerisourceBergen&#8217;s legal and financial troubles were accompanied by shareholder demands aimed at driving corporate governance changes in companies in the opioid supply chain. Determined to hold the company&#8217;s leadership accountable, the shareholders launched a campaign in early 2021 to reject the pay packages of executives.</p>
<p>Should the board reduce the executives&#8217; pay, as of means of improving accountability? Or does punishing the AmerisourceBergen executives for paying the settlement ignore the larger issue of a business&#8217;s responsibility to society?</p>
<p>Harvard Business School professor <strong>Suraj Srinivasan</strong> discusses executive compensation and shareholder activism in the context of the U.S. opioid crisis in his case, &#8220;<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/the-opioid-settlement-and-controversy-over-ceo-pay-at-amerisourcebergen/122014?sku=122014-PDF-ENG">The Opioid Settlement and Controversy Over CEO Pay at AmerisourceBergen</a>.&#8221;</p>

How did he do it?</p>
<p>Early in his career, Ali&#8217;s creativity and hard work helped him overcome significant obstacles. Rather than letting his fear of flying keep him from competing in the 1960 Olympics, he traveled to Italy wearing a parachute &#8212; and easily won the gold medal in boxing.</p>
<p>When he returned to the U.S. as a gold medalist, Ali used his growing fame to bring attention to racial justice and humanitarian causes he supported, including his then-controversial decision to refuse to fight in the Vietnam War.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, soon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had started a massive whistleblowing program with the potential for large monetary rewards, two employees of a U.S. bank&#8217;s asset management business debated whether to blow the whistle on their employer after completing an internal review that revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>The bank&#8217;s asset management business disproportionately invested clients&#8217; money in its own mutual funds over funds managed by other banks, letting it collect additional fees&#8212;and the bank had not disclosed this conflict of interest to clients. Both employees agreed that failing to disclose the conflict was a problem, but beyond that, they saw the situation very differently.</p>
<p>One employee, Neel, perceived the internal review as a good-faith effort by senior management to identify and address the problem. The other, Akash, thought that the entire business model was problematic, even with a disclosure, and believed that the bank may have even broken the law.</p>

The deal would make Microsoft the world’s third largest video game company, but it also exposes the company to several risks.

First, the all-cash deal would require Microsoft to use a large portion of its cash reserves.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bombas was started in 2013 with a dual mission: to deliver quality socks and donate much-needed footwear to people living in shelters. By 2021, it had become one of America&#8217;s most visible buy-one-give-one companies, with over $250 million in annual revenue and 50 million pairs of socks donated.</p>
<p>Initially the company had to figure out how to price its product. Socks are typically an inexpensive item of clothing, but the founders needed a price that would allow them enough margin to deliver on their social mission. They also needed to determine what role that mission should play in their marketing. Later, as Bombas expanded into underwear, t-shirts, and slippers, the company struggled to determine what pace of growth would best allow it to reach new customers while maintaining its social mission. Harvard Business School assistant professor <strong>Elizabeth Keenan</strong> discusses the case, <a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/bee-ing-better-at-bombas/522038?sku=522038-PDF-ENG"><em>Bee-ing Better at Bombas</em></a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The France Telecom case series follows the evolution of the organization from a national telephone monopoly to a private company facing severe challenges. These included a lessening competitive advantage, with the advent of mobile carriers and competition from other countries, as well as a workforce that was much larger than needed and included many civil servants, making it difficult to reduce headcount.</p>
<p>As increasing pressure mounted internally to make changes and 22,000 jobs were lost between 2006 and 2009, the culture at France Telecom shifted from one where employees were proud to work to one where the physical and mental wellbeing of some employees became increasingly fragile. Did corporate leaders push employees too far, creating unacceptable levels of stress and unhappiness?</p>
<p>Harvard Business School professors <strong>Cynthia Montgomery</strong> and <strong>Ashley Whillans</strong> discuss some fundamental tensions between the pressures and benefits of capitalism, the responsibilities of management, and the day-to-day and long-term impacts on employee well-being in the case series, &#8220;<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/france-telecom-a-a-challenging-restructuring/721420?sku=721420-PDF-ENG" rel="noopener">France Telecom: A Difficult Restructuring.</a>&#8221;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok&#8217;s parent company, ByteDance, was launched in 2012 around the simple idea of helping users entertain themselves on their smartphones while on the Beijing Subway. By May 2020, TikTok operated in 155 countries and, together with Douyin (its China app), it had roughly one billion monthly active users, placing it in the top ranks of digital platforms globally.</p>
<p>Some industry experts argued that it was the first consumer app operating at scale where artificial intelligence (or AI) was the product. But TikTok had drawn the attention of competitors, regulators, and politicians &#8212; especially in the U.S., where commercial success was critical to its long-term enterprise value. With less than two percent of its global revenue generated in the U.S., should the company continue to drive growth there or focus on monetizing that audience by introducing revenue generating activities like advertising? Would TikTok become the first &#8220;Super App&#8221; with a global footprint or, if it moved too fast, did it run the risk of becoming a supernova that shone brightly only for a passing moment?

<p>Harvard Business School associate professor <strong>Katie Coffman</strong>, Coburn, and MGB&#8217;s managing director of administration and strategy <strong>Diana Schwartzstein</strong> discuss how they worked to identify the main sources of the disparities and find the right strategy to expand and diversify MGB&#8217;s community of innovators in the case, &#8220;<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/inclusive-innovation-at-mass-general-brigham/921006?sku=921006-PDF-ENG" rel="noopener">Inclusive Innovation at Mass General Brigham</a>.&#8221;</p>

To meet a very aggressive cost target, management is faced with two options: fulfilling its contract with its new Ohio factory or its factory based out of Tianjin, China. Unlike the Ohio factory, the Chinese factory produces below the cost target, but it also incurs extensive shipping costs and requires a far greater amount of inventory holding.</p>

IBM had acquired a German company in 1922 and, like other American companies, found itself operating after 1933 in a country whose government violently suppressed political dissent and engaged in intimidation and discrimination against Jews.</p>
