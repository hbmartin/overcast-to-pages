            <title>KOFUZI - How to get faster later in life</title>
            <description>Has Kofuzi run his fastest race? This interview explores how @kofuzi has gotten faster over the years, from the first marathon to his PR at the Tokyo marathon. And it also explores his current fitness, possible future PRs and whether or not he will still go for Age-Group when the fastest race is behind him. 

DISCLSURE: Kofuzi did not ask to be on my channel. No one is making me interview him. He did cheer me on/record me running at mile 26 of the Houston Marathon. for which I am grateful. I&#039;ve been a member of the @KofuziRunClub since before that channel was even created. I first met Kofuzi back at a shakeout run for the 2022 Chicago Marathon. I am a big supporter and am hugely bias.

We also talked about running shoes but in the spirit of keeping people&#039;s attention in 2024, I am splitting the conversation into two topics and therefore, two separate videos (coming soon).

I do create content exclusively for members on the channel as well as do early release videos. If you are interested or want to support you can do so here:

            <title>Anton Krupicka on 200-Mile Weeks, Curiosity &amp; Walking Into the Unknown.</title>
            <description>Growing up on his family&#039;s farm with 640-acres right outside his doorstep, it was almost impossible that Anton &quot;Tony&quot; Krupicka would avoid becoming a runner and adventurer of the earth. Inspired by his parents to remain curious about life Tony began his explorations at a young age. Fueled by his love for learning, a natural companion to curiosity, Tony attained his earliest education on running from pamphlets put out by Runner&#039;s World in the 1970s. The artistry of training the body intrigued Tony to no end and in preparation for his first marathon at the age of 12, he experimented with calorie counting, fasting and high mileage weeks.

Tony continued running through high school and college which he attended in Colorado Springs via an academic scholarship. It was here that he was introduced to some of the most iconic running races like the Leadville Trail 100. Running 100 miles seemed quite impossible to Tony which was all the more reason to aspire to it. Led by his curiosity to test human limits, Tony eventually found himself at the starting line in Leadville in 2006, a race that would introduce him to the ultrarunning scene on a grand scale.

Although he is most well-known for his achievements in the sport of ultrarunning and for being the face of several ultrarunning document...

DESCRIPTION
Software development in the 1990s was characterized as a chaotic period with projects often failing or delivering buggy software. The traditional approach involved lengthy requirement gathering, design and coding phases, fraught with issues, such as static requirements that didn&#039;t account for evolving business needs and poor assumptions about value and functionality. The rapid evolution of frameworks, tools and techniques in the software industry came as a blessing and fostered innovation. However, it was challenging for developers as they struggled to keep up with the ...

            <title>The Code That Builds HUGE Trading Platforms | Frank Yu In The Engineering Room Ep. 18</title>
            <description>Today&#039;s Guest Frank Yu is an engineering leader at Coinbase, focusing on distributed low latency trading platforms.
In some ways the development in ultra-low-latency trading systems is analogous to Formula 1 Car racing. These people push the boundaries of what is possible in software, and sometimes hardware, to squeeze out every last ounce of performance. Code for trading though is not esoteric, or unnecessarily complex, and ideas that are explored in this, sometimes, cutting-edge domain become more widely used in the wider industry, event based systems is one such transfer that springs to mind. 
So if you want to learn how to build a trading algorithm, take advantage of event streaming to create a world-class reactive system the Dave Farley&#039;s guest in the Engineering Room, Frank Yu, explains, and Dave and Frank explore more broadly what this kind thinking and design means for software engineering more broadly.

            <title>Aino Vonge Corry On The Poor Standard Of Teaching In Computer Science | The Engineering Room Ep. 17</title>
            <description>Aino Corry is an agile expert, a teacher and a consultant. She is an expert on how teams work, and how to help them to do better. 
She is also an extremely popular public speaker with a wickedly dry sense of humour. 
Aino has been a prolific conference organiser and has been involved in selecting the content for some of the worlds major software conferences over many years, including GOTO, YOW! and QCon.

From her 25 years experience teaching computer skills in academia and industry, Aino talks to Dave about what is wrong with Computer Science teaching at Universities (or at least why it often isn&#039;t helpful to actually working in IT), her research into this problem and her work to help teachers improve their teaching.

In this episode of &quot;The Engineering Room&quot; Dave Farley and Aino Corry discuss the eductation of software developers, and how we can all learn to do better.

            <title>Kent Beck On The FIRST Testing Frameworks, TDD, Waterfall &amp; MORE | The Engineering Room Ep. 16</title>
            <description>In this episode of the Engineering Room, Dave Farley and Kent Beck have a wide-ranging discussion about the return of waterfall development in software, TDD, Software Design and lots of other things along the way.

Kent Beck is the first signatory of the Agile Manifesto. He is the author of the industry-changing book &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot;. Kent popularised Continuous Integration and TDD and wrote the first version of xUnit, the unit testing framework that has informed the design of unit testing frameworks ever since.

It is hard to imagine people who aren&#039;t familiar with Kent Beck&#039;s work, but even if that is the case, his work has had an impact on how you think about, and practice software development and software engineering.

            <title>Is Designing Different To Coding?</title>
            <description>In software development, what is the relationship between ‚ÄúCode‚Äù and ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù? Is code the responsibility of one set of people, and design another, or are these part of a continuum in software design where code, design and architecture are essential just different aspects of the same activity? Software design patterns are realised in code, and programming can be thought of as merely how we capture and communicate our design decisions.

In this episode, Dave Farley, author of ‚ÄúContinuous Delivery‚Äù and ‚ÄúModern Software Engineering&quot; explores this relationship between software design and describes how this is less about coding vs design or designer vs developer and much more that design is always fundamental to what we do as software developers.

            <title>You ONLY Get Code LIKE THIS With TDD</title>
            <description>What does Test Driven Development give you that no other way of working can? Is it an essential tool for producing elite-level software? I recently asked my followers on Twitter that same question and in this video, I review some of the responses to see what software engineers REALLY think about TDD.

Whether or not you believe TDD is the ultimate way to work with software, software testing certainly has its benefits. So what are those and how can they help you build better software faster?
