  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stanford Adjunct Professor Jeremy Utley explores the counter-intuitive tactics that world-class innovators and entrepreneurs employ to break through. He's learned that while innovation is part art (paint) – it's also part science (pipette) – and treats the subject with both the rigor and the wonder that it deserves. Season 1 shined a spotlight on female founders; season 2 celebrated black creators; Season 3 guests include WIRED co-founder Kevin Kelly, Harvard Business School Professor Linda Hill, CEO of Google X Astro Teller, start-up coach Liz Tran, Waze founder Uri Levine, Seth Godin, journalist Jennifer Wallace, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, and more.</p>]]></description>

We dive into the world of generative AI in the sports industry, focusing on the groundbreaking work being done by the Portland Trail Blazers. Joining us are David Long, VP of Digital Innovation for The Portland Trail Blazers @ the Rose Quarter, and Christa Stout, their Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. Together, we explore how AI is driving improvements across three key areas: revenue generation, customer experience, and operational efficiency. Christa and David share how they’ve empowered employees to experiment with AI, encouraging creativity and innovation across their organization. From automating routine tasks like customer feedback analysis to using AI for creative problem-solving, the Trail Blazers have created a supportive environment where AI is seen as a co-worker rather than a replacement. We also examine the importance of active leadership in normalizing AI adoption, ethical considerations, and best practices for helping teams embrace this technology.

Today, on the podcast, we welcome Teresa Amabile to help us explore the crucial role that managers play in shaping the inner work lives of their employees through the lens of her book, <em>The Progress Principle</em>. Teresa Amabile is a distinguished scholar and researcher in organizational behavior. She is renowned for her groundbreaking work on creativity, motivation, and the work environment. Joining as a co-host is Diego Rodriguez, a board member at LendingTree, whose expertise extends to pioneering tough tech, fintech, and shaping the future of transportation.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>From psychology to neuroscience and beyond, concepts of intelligence, genius, and hyperfixation are key to our understanding of human potential. During this episode, David McRaney joins us to discuss a topic of great import to our course on transformative design; the complexity of the concept of genius. David is a famed journalist, author, podcaster, and expert on belief, currently researching his next book.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Understanding and adapting to unwritten rules and organizational culture is a continual process. It&apos;s essential to strike a balance between fitting into the existing culture and bringing in new perspectives to drive positive change. In today’s episode, we sit down with Liz Wiseman, a management expert and CEO of The Wiseman Group, to discuss the challenges of controlling idea flow and the problems it might cause in leadership roles. Liz is a renowned researcher and best-selling author who empowers global organizations with her groundbreaking insights on leadership development. In our conversation, we cover a range of topics, from leadership challenges to the use of AI in idea generation, and the importance of recognizing, owning, and addressing critical, unassigned issues within an organization.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding and adapting to unwritten rules and organizational culture is a continual process. It&apos;s essential to strike a balance between fitting into the existing culture and bringing in new perspectives to drive positive change. In today’s episode, we sit down with Liz Wiseman, a management expert and CEO of The Wiseman Group, to discuss the challenges of controlling idea flow and the problems it might cause in leadership roles. Liz is a renowned researcher and best-selling author who empowers global organizations with her groundbreaking insights on leadership development. In our conversation, we cover a range of topics, from leadership challenges to the use of AI in idea generation, and the importance of recognizing, owning, and addressing critical, unassigned issues within an organization. We unpack understanding organizational culture, identifying impact players, the role of context in performance, and maintaining an impact player mindset within different work environments.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s parental landscape is filled with more challenges than ever before. Among the plethora of concerns that parents have to deal with on an everyday basis, one never would’ve expected toxic achievement to be one of them. Who even knew that achievement could be toxic?!  But too much of anything is never good, and placing too much attention on your child’s educational success could be irreversibly damaging to their self-esteem. To help us make better sense of this topic, we are joined today by the award-winning journalist and author of <em>Never Enough</em>, Jennifer Wallace.

For today’s conversation, we are joined by the co-founder of Waze and serial entrepreneur, Uri Levine. Uri has just written a new book, <em>Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution</em>, which is a practical guide for entrepreneurs on how to endure the rollercoaster of failure – faster and with more fun!

Uri shares why failure is an absolute necessity and how failing faster is always better, before coaching established brands through the ins and outs of disruptions. To end, we discuss whether it’s better to solve a problem for yourself or others or both, and the extremely passionate and knowledgeable Uri Levine shows us how innovators, enthusiastic amateurs, early adopters, the early majority, and first-time users influence how you solve your organizational problems. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Key Points From This Episode:</b></p><ul><li>Introducing the very passionate serial entrepreneur, Uri Levine. </li><li>When Uri first realized that the problem is more important than the solution. </li><li>His process for documenting problems, and when he first started making these notes. </li><li>How he approaches people about a particular problem. </li><li>Moving beyond conversation to build conviction. </li><li>Being elected: falling in love with a problem to endure through failure; staying on mission.  </li><li>Threading the needle between experimentation and maintaining focus. </li><li>Why failure is necessary for success, and how it helps to fail faster. </li><li>The innovation dilemma: coaching established brands through disruptions. </li><li>When to invest in a disrupter versus when to become one yourself.  </li><li>Solving a problem for yourself versus solving it for someone else. </li><li>Organizational problems: how solving them may become your competitive advantage.  </li></ul><p><br/></p><p><b>Links Mentioned in Today’s Episode:</b></p><p><a href='https://urilevine.com/'>Uri Levine</a> </p><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/uri-levine-85389/'>Uri Levine on LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/urilevine1'>Uri Levine on X</a></p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIWE3QJfJ98Hf9jD7oXXYZw'>Uri Levine on YouTube</a> </p><p><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Love-Problem-Solution-Entrepreneurs/dp/1637741987'><em>Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution</em></a><em> </em></p><p><a href='https://www.waze.com/'>Waze</a></p><p><a href='https://www.danpink.com/'>Daniel H.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today on the show, we have a great conversation with Edwin Catmull, the Founder and former CEO at Pixar and former CEO of Disney Animation Studios. Edwin dives deep into some of the ideas that he shared in his book <em>Creativity Inc.</em>, so you can expect a real masterclass on the creative process and how this translates to high-level teams. We get into some insightful discussions on the objectivity problem, learning by doing, the dangers of overestimating past successes, and the constancy of change. Edwin also makes amazing arguments for why learning should be centralized in the creative process and how balance is often struck through forward motion.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today on the show, we have a great conversation with Edwin Catmull, the Founder and former CEO at Pixar and former CEO of Disney Animation Studios. Edwin dives deep into some of the ideas that he shared in his book <em>Creativity Inc.</em>, so you can expect a real masterclass on the creative process and how this translates to high-level teams. We get into some insightful discussions on the objectivity problem, learning by doing, the dangers of overestimating past successes, and the constancy of change. Edwin also makes amazing arguments for why learning should be centralized in the creative process and how balance is often struck through forward motion. Along the way, you can expect to hear some colorful anecdotes about some of the beloved movies that Edwin was involved in, including <em>Zootopia</em>, <em>Finding Nemo</em>, and <em>Monsters University</em>. The wonderful thing about this conversation is how specific it is to the world of animated films, but also how these lessons and ideas translate for leaders in any field.

From submitting an NBA salary caps article alongside his compensation table, to why brewing coffee is similar to a barbecue, Aaron’s outlook is wonderfully unique, a driving force in the success behind Portrait Coffee.

Fast forward to the founding of Soul Surplus, a full-service production company that creates original music compositions and digital media for music producers, filmmakers, content creators, and brands. Having built his personal music library for over a decade, Wes co-founded Soul Surplus in 2016 as a response to the recurring issue he was experiencing in the music industry as a producer and entrepreneur. We talk with Wes about the founding of Soul Surplus and how his observations about the marketplace helped him realize that he couldn’t do it alone. Wes shares how he and his team got together, what they each brought to the table and why he’s so grateful that none of them have a big ego. He describes the circumstances where they nearly lost everything in 2019, and how, despite major setbacks, they were still able to reach their goal and be successfully acquired by another company. Wes also explains how being a lifelong learner has shaped his life and why he dedicates three hours every day to learning.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the intersection of design, biology, and engineering, today’s guest has a few ideas about what people in these fields can learn from each other! Whitney Burks is a designer, scientist, Stanford softball player, and all-around incredible creative. In this episode, she sheds light on her creative strengths and how they manifest themselves in other aspects of her work.  She explains how she mixes mechanical engineering and biology in her job and why she sets up her biology experiments like an engineer.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the intersection of design, biology, and engineering, today’s guest has a few ideas about what people in these fields can learn from each other! Whitney Burks is a designer, scientist, Stanford softball player, and all-around incredible creative. In this episode, she sheds light on her creative strengths and how they manifest themselves in other aspects of her work.  She explains how she mixes mechanical engineering and biology in her job and why she sets up her biology experiments like an engineer. She also shares her thoughts on experimentation: how biologists are skeptical of feedback, how designers are not, and why designers should not only be more skeptical but also do more assessments and assess more values. We discuss the importance of finding time to allow meaning, data analysis, data synthesizing, and creative ideas to evolve, and the tension of doing this while also working towards deadlines.

When he became a high school teacher, however, he wanted better for his students. What started as a meeting with some students to figure out how he could become a better teacher evolved into an entire movement and, today, we are honored to be joined by Ashanti Branch, Founder of the Ever Forward Club and the Million Mask Movement, which helps young people understand how connected they are when it comes to the masks we wear. In this episode, Ashanti sheds light on the struggles he faced as a child when it came to dealing with his emotions and shares a potentially-triggering and emotional story of a trauma he experienced as an eight-year-old. Please note that this episode carries a trigger warning for sexual assault. He also explains how he became involved in a men’s circle and learned to stop suppressing his feelings. To hear the magic sentence Ashanti heard from one of his high school teachers that had a profound effect on his life and how he has gone on to impact the lives of so many others, plus so much more, tune in today!

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Many, many businesses suffered during the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic; those who rely on face-to-face interactions probably more so than most. But in today’s episode, we’re joined by an entrepreneur who didn’t let the lockdown dull her spirits or her motivation. Annie Stancliffe creatively pivoted the focus of her nail salon business, High Five, during the lockdown, and she stayed true to her goal of creating a space and a brand that “feels like home” when things opened up again. Annie’s pattern-recognition and people skills, along with her fresh perspective on the beauty industry, have allowed her to break down some of the pervasive, harmful norms which exist. In today’s episode you’ll hear some examples of how Annie and her team have solved operational challenges, how they respond to the desires of their customers, why Annie chose not to raise venture capital, and how she lives out the concept of Ikigai. We always thought Annie was going to solve some of the world’s big problems, and after speaking with her today we know we were right! </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Key Points From This Episode:</b></p><ul><li>How the pandemic altered their plans, and how they made the most of the lockdown.</li><li>The importance of being motivated about the direction you are taking your business.</li><li>What excites Annie about her job.</li><li>Why Annie decided not to raise any funding for High Five, and how this impacts the company’s growth.</li><li>Pressure that people feel to raise venture funding.</li><li>Annie’s experience of working in a venture backed start-up.</li><li>What Annie learned about herself while doing her MBA.</li><li>How Annie sees her future unfolding.</li><li>The problem with tipping.</li><li>Why Annie sees her lack of background in the beauty industry as an advantage. </li><li>Learnings that Annie has had along her journey of running High Five.</li><li>How Annie utilized the High Five space when nail salons were not allowed to operate, and how this benefited her business in the long term.</li><li>Creativity prompts that Annie uses in her team meetings.</li><li>The transferable nature of the skills that Annie utilizes in her business.</li><li>An example of how High Five responds solves operational challenges in an on-brand way.</li><li>How High Five promotes conversation in the salon and online.</li><li>A trait that is common amongst women, and one of Annie’s key goals which relates to this.</li><li>Advice from Annie for dealing with the stresses of being a founder and CEO.</li><li>High Five’s approach to service and product options, and how they have evolved over time.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><b>Links Mentioned in Today’s Episode:</b></p><p><a href='mailto:annie@wehighfive.com'>Annie Stancliffe Email Address</a></p><p><a href='https://wehighfive.com/'>High Five</a></p><p><a href='https://www.instagram.com/highfivenicenails/?hl=en'>High Five on Instagram</a></p><p><a href='https://launchpad.net/'>Launchpad</a></p>]]></description>

Annie Stancliffe creatively pivoted the focus of her nail salon business, High Five, during the lockdown, and she stayed true to her goal of creating a space and a brand that “feels like home” when things opened up again. Annie’s pattern-recognition and people skills, along with her fresh perspective on the beauty industry, have allowed her to break down some of the pervasive, harmful norms which exist. In today’s episode you’ll hear some examples of how Annie and her team have solved operational challenges, how they respond to the desires of their customers, why Annie chose not to raise venture capital, and how she lives out the concept of Ikigai. We always thought Annie was going to solve some of the world’s big problems, and after speaking with her today we know we were right! </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Key Points From This Episode:</b></p><ul><li>How the pandemic altered their plans, and how they made the most of the lockdown.</li><li>The importance of being motivated about the direction you are taking your business.</li><li>What excites Annie about her job.</li><li>Why Annie decided not to raise any funding for High Five, and how this impacts the company’s growth.</li><li>Pressure that people feel to raise venture funding.</li><li>Annie’s experience of working in a venture backed start-up.</li><li>What Annie learned about herself while doing her MBA.</li><li>How Annie sees her future unfolding.</li><li>The problem with tipping.</li><li>Why Annie sees her lack of background in the beauty industry as an advantage. </li><li>Learnings that Annie has had along her journey of running High Five.</li><li>How Annie utilized the High Five space when nail salons were not allowed to operate, and how this benefited her business in the long term.</li><li>Creativity prompts that Annie uses in her team meetings.</li><li>The transferable nature of the skills that Annie utilizes in her business.</li><li>An example of how High Five responds solves operational challenges in an on-brand way.</li><li>How High Five promotes conversation in the salon and online.</li><li>A trait that is common amongst women, and one of Annie’s key goals which relates to this.</li><li>Advice from Annie for dealing with the stresses of being a founder and CEO.</li><li>High Five’s approach to service and product options, and how they have evolved over time.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><b>Links Mentioned in Today’s Episode:</b></p><p><a href='mailto:annie@wehighfive.com'>Annie Stancliffe Email Address</a></p><p><a href='https://wehighfive.com/'>High Five</a></p><p><a href='https://www.instagram.com/highfivenicenails/?hl=en'>High Five on Instagram</a></p><p><a href='https://launchpad.net/'>Launchpad</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

One company that was uniquely positioned to help businesses during this dramatic transition was Via, an online platform that allows companies to seamlessly build remote teams across countries in 48 hours. Via was co-founded by Maite Diez-Canedo and Itziar Diez-Canedo during their time at Stanford and underwent a significant pivot prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While countless successful businesses have been founded by siblings, it’s rare for those siblings to be sisters rather than brothers. We unpack some of the societal prejudices that female founders encounter while fundraising - as demonstrated by some discouraging statistics - and how skepticism increases when investors are faced with female co-founders, especially sisters. We hear more about how Maite and Itziar address these biases when they encounter them, and how they have been able to overcome initial ignorance or prejudice through direct and honest communication. Later, we examine some of the practices, habits, and mindset adjustments that have helped Maite and Itziar in entrepreneurship and creativity. We also take a hopeful look at the importance of challenging assumptions and how bringing playfulness to a problem can open up new possibilities.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Sustainably produced, healthy food is inaccessible to many, but it does not have to be this way. The food system is wasteful, unjust, and unsustainable. Noemie Delfassy is a food entrepreneur and recipe creator. Her company, Frecious, works with local farms, using in-season produce to produce healthy, organic snacks. Through a combination of technology, supply chain innovation, and operational process transformation, Noemie has managed to carve a niche in the food sector. In today&apos;s episode, we hear more about what Frecious does, and Noemie shares the impetus for starting the company. She offers insights into why she left a stable career to go down this unpredictable, but ultimately rewarding, path. Noemie talks about fundraising and the reason she has not partnered with external investors.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sustainably produced, healthy food is inaccessible to many, but it does not have to be this way. The food system is wasteful, unjust, and unsustainable. Noemie Delfassy is a food entrepreneur and recipe creator. Her company, Frecious, works with local farms, using in-season produce to produce healthy, organic snacks. Through a combination of technology, supply chain innovation, and operational process transformation, Noemie has managed to carve a niche in the food sector. In today&apos;s episode, we hear more about what Frecious does, and Noemie shares the impetus for starting the company. She offers insights into why she left a stable career to go down this unpredictable, but ultimately rewarding, path. Noemie talks about fundraising and the reason she has not partnered with external investors. Despite the availability of venture capital, finding a backer that is as committed to true sustainability as she is, has proven to be challenging. Our conversation also touches on staying motivated on the path you have chosen to follow, dealing with a toxic work environment, and much more.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the notoriously unsustainable world of fashion, daring to do things differently is no easy feat. Yet, it is something today&apos;s guest, Diarra Bousso&apos;s conscious lifestyle brand, DIARRABLU, has managed to excel at. Divided between her home country of Senegal and the U.S., DIARRABLU draws on Senegalese artisanal skills and clothes-making principles. These are the clothes you will have for life. Along with being a serial entrepreneur, Diarra is also a creative mathematician and multidisciplinary artist. In this episode, Diarra shares her journey with us, from growing up in Dakar to working on Wall Street and everything in between. We hear about the accident that changed her life and how she had the confidence to step out and try something new even when she did not have a clear idea of what she wanted to do. Diarra talks about the instrumental role her family has played and still plays in her success, and she reflects on the benefits of having a constant and consistent hype team. Our conversation also touches on how DIARRABLU stays true to its ethos, why Diarra loves teaching, and what&apos;s on the horizon for the company.  </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Key Points From This Episode:</b></p><ul><li>Get to know today&apos;s guest, Diarra Bousso. </li><li>What Diarra&apos;s upbringing in Senegal was like and the philosophy of excellence that was instilled in her. </li><li>Diarra&apos;s winding career journey and how she came to combine her range of skills. </li><li>Why Diarra decided to be an entrepreneur despite not knowing what she was going to do. </li><li>The event that led Diarra to quit her job in finance and pursue a creative path. </li><li>How Diarra started her business in Senegal. </li><li>The challenge Diarra had teaching high school math and what she learned from it. </li><li>Growth diarrablu has seen since it started and how it remains true to its roots </li><li>How many people work at diarrablu currently. </li><li>An example of how diarrablu has stayed true to its ethos while reaching a broader market. </li><li>The community that diarrablu has built and the level of consciousness they have. </li><li>Something Diarra has recently learned. </li><li>The role that Diarra&apos;s parents played in instilling confidence in her. </li><li>A recent time Diarra needed to be hyped up. </li><li>What the future has in store for diarrablu&apos;s company structure. </li><li>How teaching inspires Diarra and the role it has played in helping her be a better leader.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><b>Links Mentioned in Today’s Episode:</b></p><p><a href='https://www.instagram.com/thediarrablu/?hl=en'>Diarra Bousso on Instagram</a></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/dbdiarrabousso?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor'>Diarra Bousso on Twitter</a></p><p><a href='https://diarrablu.com/'>diarrablu</a></p><p><a href='https://www.jeremyutley.design/'>Jeremy Utley</a></p>]]></description>
