<p><br></p>
<p>9:36</p>
<p>“What that experience taught me was the power of actually having the individuals who are being impacted at the table and at the highest levels. And so, for me, what was exciting was to join all of these meetings and to actually see the people from the countries where their solutions were being talked about quite literally driving the answer forward and it&#39;s absolutely now what we try and do within the team that I&#39;m on at HP is make sure there are no siloed solutions coming out of this and we&#39;re truly thinking about what are we even trying to address? Do we have it in our head right or do we have to step back and talk to those being impacted?”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>17:45</p>
<p>“You have to know what you&#39;re doing with the technology that you have. My Cambodia experience showed me there&#39;s so many times technology gets dropped in a classroom, someone checks the box that a solution has arrived and they leave. And it never gets used. There&#39;s no confidence to use this in front of a classroom of children or learning adults and you say to yourself, what was it all for? So, I think that holistic approach is truly what allows the power of partnership, but it also allows companies to think about what&#39;s your unique value and being able to help be a part of the solution.”</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Laying the Bedrock for Gen-AI at Amazon with AWS VP of Gen-AI Vasi Philomin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Shift AI, Dr. Vasi Philomin, VP of Generative AI at Amazon Web Services (AWS) shares his experience as a visionary in machine learning and AI, his insights on applying generative AI at Amazon/AWS, and his thoughts on the ethical dimensions and future potential of AI technologies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Highlights from Vasi’s comments, edited for context and clarity:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Early work experiences:</strong> Pioneered connected lighting at Philips Lighting with the City Touch system at Philips Lighting, enabling remote management of city lighting grids and achieving global adoption.</li>
 <li><strong>First Paying Job</strong>: During a summer internship at Benz in Germany, Vasi delved into computer vision for autonomous navigation.</li>
 <li><strong>Family Life:</strong> Growing up in a family of medical professionals, I diverged into a math-focused area of computer science, specifically AI, supported by my family despite our different professional paths.</li>
 <li><strong>Amazon &amp; Generative AI:</strong> At Amazon, we identified three key themes in applying generative AI: the diversity of AI models for different use cases, the need for enterprises to differentiate themselves, and the balance of cost-effectiveness and value.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon Bedrock:</strong> Bedrock aims to apply technologies like generative AI at scale. Offering choice, customization, and custom chips for improved generative AI applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Human and AI Congruence:</strong> AI should handle tedious tasks, allowing humans to focus on complex problems. While human oversight is still essential for verifying AI outputs and augmenting productivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>Code Whisper:</strong> Created to address the challenges of new programming languages, Code Whisperer enhances developer productivity, with recent updates for customization to internal code bases.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentors:</strong> Azriel Rosenfield, my grad school advisor, taught me discipline, while Jeffery Cassis at Philips Lighting taught me a more inclusive approach to collaboration and problem-solving.</li>
  <li><strong>Future of Work:</strong> Generative AI is set to bring transformational productivity, surpassing the internet in impact, tackling complex problems, and augmenting human performance at an unprecedented scale.</li>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Shift AI, Dr. Vasi Philomin, VP of Generative AI at Amazon Web Services (AWS) shares his experience as a visionary in machine learning and AI, his insights on applying generative AI at Amazon/AWS, and his thoughts on the ethical dimensions and future potential of AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from Vasi’s comments, edited for context and clarity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early work experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; Pioneered connected lighting at Philips Lighting with the City Touch system at Philips Lighting, enabling remote management of city lighting grids and achieving global adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Paying Job&lt;/strong&gt;: During a summer internship at Benz in Germany, Vasi delved into computer vision for autonomous navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Growing up in a family of medical professionals, I diverged into a math-focused area of computer science, specifically AI, supported by my family despite our different professional paths.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon &amp;amp; Generative AI:&lt;/strong&gt; At Amazon, we identified three key themes in applying generative AI: the diversity of AI models for different use cases, the need for enterprises to differentiate themselves, and the balance of cost-effectiveness and value.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Bedrock:&lt;/strong&gt; Bedrock aims to apply technologies like generative AI at scale. Offering choice, customization, and custom chips for improved generative AI applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human and AI Congruence:&lt;/strong&gt; AI should handle tedious tasks, allowing humans to focus on complex problems. While human oversight is still essential for verifying AI outputs and augmenting productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Code Whisper:&lt;/strong&gt; Created to address the challenges of new programming languages, Code Whisperer enhances developer productivity, with recent updates for customization to internal code bases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentors:&lt;/strong&gt; Azriel Rosenfield, my grad school advisor, taught me discipline, while Jeffery Cassis at Philips Lighting taught me a more inclusive approach to collaboration and problem-solving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future of Work:&lt;/strong&gt; Generative AI is set to bring transformational productivity, surpassing the internet in impact, tackling complex problems, and augmenting human performance at an unprecedented scale.&lt;/li&gt;
