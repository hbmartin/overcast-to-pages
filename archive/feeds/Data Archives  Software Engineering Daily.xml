										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Java is one of the most widely used programming languages, and a key contributor to its success is VMware Tanzu’s Spring, the most common framework for Java development. The Spring Framework is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine and provides a consistent programming and configuration model for application developers. From inception, it was designed with developer experience and modularity in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The open-source application framework has been accelerating Java development times since its inception in 2004 (Happy 20th birthday). Since then, the platform has been expanding: growing 50% year over year during the last five years. In this blog we’re exploring what makes Spring important to Java, how the framework influenced the developer experience, and a look at the latest version of Spring, which introduces features to support AI integration.</p>
<h2>Spring Success</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, there were dozens of different ways to connect to a database, something just about every application has to do at some point. “At the time, the various approaches were very cumbersome: developers wrote a lot of code and gained very little functionality,” explained Mark Pollack, a Senior Staff Engineer, Tanzu Division, Broadcom. “Spring provided a lot of value by simplifying the process. Just getting a single app to talk to a database, present a web form, and do transactions correctly was a huge win. In that era, developers could spend weeks trying to create that function.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another reason for its success is its enterprise-focus. Most open source projects concentrate on the consumer market. However, large companies invest a lot of money building applications to run their businesses. “At the end of the day, large corporations’ largest expense is probably their developers,” explained Ryan Morgan, Senior Director of Engineering, Tanzu Division, Broadcom. Spring makes developer teams more efficient, which greatly enhances the bottom line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the years, the ecosystem has grown. “There’s a large and vibrant community behind Spring,” noted Tanzu’s Morgan. Now, it has more than 200 different technology starters. These software building blocks make it simpler for software engineers to integrate their code with different third-party systems.</p>
<h2>Get a Great Start</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Development problems evolve over time, so various elements were added. Spring Initializer is a bootstrapping tool, a way for developers to create a new project. “Normally, software engineers started from a blank piece of paper and had to figure out what type of project it was and what type of libraries were needed,” said Tanzu’s Morgan. Then, they searched the web to find some place in the documentation that told them what library dependency was needed to add for different pieces of functionality. Then invariably, you cut and pasted from something that wasn&#8217;t consistent. You ended up with a mess.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Spring Initializer, software engineers go to a website which has clear instructions about what the options are and presents them in a typical web form. Then, they enter the Generate command and out comes a shell that they can use to start building their program. The solution does not generate any code but solves the problem of finding the right application dependencies. Developers start faster and are less frustrated than previous methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under development is Spring CLI, which not only creates the shell of the app but also includes code. The advances have a significant impact because 1 million new projects are created each month.</p>
<h2>Meet the Need for Development Speed</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last 10 years have seen a major move to container deployment and Spring has aligned with this paradigm shift. “Really, when you think about all those cloud native patterns, a lot of those container functions are really baked into our projects already,” stated Tanzu’s Morgan. “If you want to do distributed configuration, we have a solution for that. You want to do service discovery; Spring has patterns and tools for that.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, a major change to Spring occurred. Rather than release new functions autonomously, they are gathered and bundled into Spring Boot. Version 3.0, which is based on Spring Framework 6.0, requires Java 17 or above. Previously, Spring supported Java 8, so the change is significant for some companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Better performance is one benefit from the change. “We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/how-netflix-increased-application-performance-with-spring-boot-3-and-java-17">customers</a> realize 15% performance improvements, just from doing the upgrade,” said Tanzu’s Morgan.</p>
<h2>Java Supports Generative AI</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI is being woven into many applications, especially with the emergence of Generative AI solutions. They represent a quantum leap in capabilities and overall intelligence compared to previous iterations of AI. One reason why today’s generative models are gaining so much attention is that they work with much larger volumes of information (hundreds of billions of words) and larger data models (hundreds of billions of parameters) compared to previous AI systems. They possess impressive and unprecedented power. Consequently, they can perform very sophisticated functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However as developers try to take advantage of the functionality, platform diversity again presents development challenges. “OpenAI has their API, Amazon Bedrock offers a different one, and so do other companies,” noted Tanzu’s Pollack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A guiding focus and design principle in the Spring framework is simplifying such work by providing common abstractions over similar technologies and interfaces. Spring AI is quickly becoming the starting point when Java developers write AI applications. “Spring AI has the common patterns that Spring developers are used to,” noted Tanzu’s Pollack. It can abstract out models, clients, etc. in ways that are familiar to Spring users.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another crucial part of AI applications is using a vector database. Spring supports multiple vector databases, and its portable API simplifies changing implementations. So, Spring streamlines AI application development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Java has been a popular programming language for enterprises for decades. Spring provides software engineers with tools that help them enhance the development process. The framework has reached its 20th year of empowering developers, and its years, engaged community is laying the groundwork for continued expansion in the coming decades. “Maybe one reason why Spring continues to do well is it constantly tries to improve itself and doesn&#8217;t just rest on its laurels,” concluded Tanzu’s Pollack.</p>

The project has modest origins and started merely to support other projects the brothers were working on. However, over time the project grew and in 2021  they started working on it full-time. Since then the project has gained serious adoption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Maritime logistics is the process organizing the movement of goods across the ocean. Historically, this has been a challenging problem because of the multinational nature of shipping, as well as piracy, smuggling, and legacy technology. It&#8217;s also profoundly important for security reasons, and because 90% of what we buy travels over the oceans. Ocean vessels produce a lot of CO2, which adds climate change and energy dimensions to maritime logistics.</p>

<div>Data breaches at major companies are so now common that they hardly make the news. The Wikipedia page on data breaches lists over 350 between 2004 and 2023. The Equifax breach in 2017 was especially notable because over 160 million records were leaked, and much of the data was acquired by Equifax without individuals&#8217; knowledge or consent. Data breaches are increasingly costly to companies and to affected users who must deal with the ensuing identity theft.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>In 2018 the European Union implemented the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Despite its mild name, the GDPR had major consequences for individuals&#8217; rights to control their data, and for companies that operate in the EU. Among other things, it gives the right to have personal data removed from a company’s records. This is the so-called &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://twitter.com/GalRingel">Gal Ringel</a> is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.mineos.ai">Mine</a>, which allows users to identify which companies have their data, and it automates the process of removing data on behalf of its users. In this way, Mine aims to reduce online exposure and minimize risk for anyone using online services. Gal joins the show today to talk about his company, the impact of GDPR, and how his experience in military intelligence, venture capital, and tech led him to co-found the company.</div>

However, it&#8217;s not uncommon for the volume of observability data to exceed the amount of actual business data. This creates two challenges &#8211; how to analyze the large stream of observability data, and how to keep down the compute and storage costs for that data.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><a href="https://chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a> is a popular observability platform that works by identifying the data that&#8217;s actually being used to power dashboards and metrics. It then shows the cost for each segment of data, and allows users to decide if a metric is worth that cost. In this way, technical teams can manage costs by dynamically adjusting which data is analyzed and stored. <a href="https://twitter.com/martin_c_mao?lang=en">Martin Mao</a> is the Co-founder and CEO of Chronosphere and he joins the podcast today to talk about the growing challenge of managing observability data, and the design of Chronosphere.</p>

<div>The importance of data teams is undeniable. Most companies today use data to drive decision-making on anything from software feature development to product strategy, hiring and marketing. In some companies data is the product, which can make data teams even more vital. But there&#8217;s a common problem &#8211; analyzing data is hard and time consuming. Lots of people have questions they want to answer with data, but data teams often don&#8217;t have the resources to move quickly. This can create a pernicious effect where organizations stop asking questions about their own data.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/cutlasskelly">Amanda Kelly</a> thinks a lot about data and the dynamics of data teams inside organizations. She&#8217;s worked at Google X, and on self-driving cars and cybersecurity. Her experiences on data teams inspired her to co-found Streamlit, which is an open source Python library that gives primitives to assemble a data app for rapid data visualization and interaction. Her goal was to accelerate the iteration loop to go from a question to a data-driven answer. Amanda is currently the COO of <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> and a Product Director at Snowflake, and she joins us today to talk all about data and how she&#8217;s building Streamlit.</div>

Much of this content is optimized to be viewed by human eyes, not consumed by machines. However, creating systems to automatically parse and structure the web greatly extends its utility, and paves the way for innovative solutions and applications. The industry of web scraping has emerged to do just that. However, many websites erect obstacles to hinder web scraping. This has created a new kind of arms race between developers and anti-scraping software.</p>

As data volumes increase, the opportunity to get great ML results rises, but so does the problem of labeling all the data to get that excellent result.</p>
<p>Enter Snorkel AI’s programmatic data labeling and MLops platforms like Snorkel Flow. Today we are interviewing <a href="https://twitter.com/ajratner/with_replies">Alex Ratner</a>, one of the founders of <a href="https://snorkel.ai/">Snorkel AI</a>. Snorkel AI evolved from research Alex led as part of his Ph.D. research at Stanford, focused on programmatic data labeling to enable much faster and more accurate ML training and retraining.</p>
<p>Alex is a born teacher who always has enthusiasm for the topic. Today he will share the newest evolutions of the product at Snorkel, shed light on why doing ML well requires programmatic data labeling, and talk about foundation models in actual enterprise settings and generally.</p>

It takes significant time and investment to tame this chaos. When you are a platform provider you are gathering tons of data from the developers using your platform. These developers building products on your platform need insight into that data to better understand how their application is performing or to troubleshoot it. Most Platforms or SaaS application providers find it both difficult and expensive to build customer-facing analytics and data applications into their platforms. In fact most companies don’t know what to do with the data they are gathering and continually postpone future product roadmap features aimed to unlock this data. This data can be a crucial part of the developer experience and can empower your customers. It can save you countless hours of handling support tickets, and increase overall stickiness on the platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propeldata.com/">Propel</a> is a GraphQL API platform ideal for powering customer-facing analytics use cases, from customer dashboards and analytics APIs to product usage or in-product metrics.<br />

In doing so, Data Activation helps bring data people toward the center of the business, directly tying their work to business outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightouch.com/">Hightouch</a> is the simplest and fastest way to get started with Data Activation. As a Data Activation Platform, Hightouch uses Reverse ETL to sync data from the warehouse to 100+ different integrations. With Hightouch companies can leverage their existing data models and easily view and monitor all of their data syncs in a single platform. Better yet, Hightouch offers a visual audience builder that makes it easy for non-technical users to create custom audiences at moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

They provide scalability, fault tolerance, improved performance, and cost savings. By distributing data across nodes, they allow for efficient processing of large amounts of data and redundancy against failures. They can also be used to store data across multiple locations for faster access and better performance.</p>
<p>Turso is an edge-hosted, distributed database based on libSQL, an open-source and open-contribution fork of SQLite. It was designed to minimize query latency for applications where queries come from anywhere in the world. In particular, it works well with edge functions provided by cloud platforms such as CloudFlare, Netlify, and Vercel, by putting your data geographically close to the code that accesses it.</p>

These complex enterprises have a huge opportunity ahead &#8211; to transform themselves to become a trusted hub of a much broader data ecosystem that goes beyond the financial industry and helps to form a new class of cross-industry experience architectures that are scalable and transparent. The data physics that is needed for such emerging systems runs on consent and privacy preservation rather than black-boxed data lakes. A foundation for making this happen lies in the ability to use distributed, heterogenous data effectively and transform it into experiences that are relevant to the customer. These new experience architectures are following design patterns that are more participatory and consent-based than blindly personalized. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we deep dive into the context-aware<a href="https://www.flybits.com/"> Flybits</a> platform with founder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/hosinux">Hossein Rahnama</a>, alongside their CTO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petarkramaric/?originalSubdomain=ca">Petar Kramaric</a>, and VP of Engineering, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlamdev/?originalSubdomain=ca">Justin Lam</a>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">               Sponsorship inquiries: <a href="sponsor@softwareengineeringdaily.com">sponsor@softwareengineeringdaily.com</a></span></p>								</div>

		<itunes:summary>Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL cloud database. Since its creation, Couchbase has expanded into edge computing, application services, and most recently, a database-as-a-service called Capella.  Couchbase started as an in-memory cache and needed to be rearchitected to be a persistent storage system. In this episode, We interviewed Ravi Mayuram, SVP Products, and Engineering at Couchbase.</itunes:summary>

However, stream processing &#8211; the act of filtering, transforming, or analyzing the data inside the messages &#8211; is still an exercise left to the receiving microservice or datastore, a custom programming exercise likely repeated over and over within an application. Stream processing tools such as Apache Flink and ksqlDB have been around for half a decade, but their complexity has hindered adoption. Decodable’s mission is to radically simplify processing on the stream with a SaaS platform based on Flink, and using only SQL which frees up developers to focus on what matters most.</span></p>
<p>Eric Sammer is founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.decodable.co/">Decodable</a> and joins the show to discuss the potential of stream processing, its role in modern data platforms, and how it’s being used today.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution many turn to for capturing their streaming data is <strong>InfluxDB</strong>.  In this episode, I interview <strong>Brian Gilmore</strong>, Director of Product Management at InfluxData, about how real time applications achieve success built on top of InfluxDB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When most people hear the phrase Internet of Things, it typically evokes an image of connected devices we install in our homes.  While this is a common use case, the true winner to date in IoT is probably industrial automation.  While small improvements can yield big returns, and small errors can result in huge losses, it&#8217;s critical to capture and elegantly handle telemetry data from industrial systems.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When writing code, test driven development is a common accepted methodology to ensure the development of high quality software.  Your organization’s data, on the other hand, is an entirely different challenge.  Data can be missing due to human error, a failure with a 3rd party provider, a botched release, or dozens of other issues.  When not missing, data can still become corrupted or start exhibiting a trend in the wrong direction that isn’t obvious to notice.</p>
<p>Anomalo is a complete data quality platform.  It can monitor your enterprise data and alert you to problems that are automatically detected.  In this episode, I interview Jeremy Stanley about the ways in which teams are using the platform to monitor and improve their data quality.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relational databases have been a fixture of software applications for decades.  They are highly tuned for performance and typically offer explicit guarantees like transactional consistency.  More recently, there’s been a figurative cambrian explosion of other-than-relational databases.  Simple key value stores or counters were an early win in this space. Managing a graph data structure is a more challenging task than key value stores.  Asking questions of graphs demands a robust query language.  Ideally, you’d also want to provide common graph algorithms to users out of box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MemGraph is an in-memory graph database that seeks to fill this need in a real-time fashion.  It’s a performance driven solution that offers developers a mature option for managing and utilizing graph data.  In this interview, I speak with Dominik Tomicevic, Founder and CEO of MemGraph.  We discuss implementation and adoption details of MemGraph as well as the ways machine learning engineers use it for feature engineering in real time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s data-driven age, a better experience can be provided that is data-driven, personalized, and automated.  Amplemarket leverages machine learning in the development of next-generation sales tools.  In this episode, I interview João Batalha, Co-Founder, and CEO of Amplemarket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application observability is a fairly mature area.  Engineering teams have a wide selection of tools they can choose to adopt and a significant amount of thought leadership and philosophy already exists giving guidance for managing your application.  That application is going to persist data.  As you scale up, your system is invariably going to experience problems beyond common metrics like response time, CPU usage, and throughput.  At some point, you’ll experience data issues that, in many organizations, are discovered manually during a root cause analysis which links a downstream problem to a change in the database that wasn’t caught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metaplane is a monitoring tool for your data warehouse.  It monitors your tables and raises alerts when issues such as anomaly detection occur.  In this interview, I speak with Kevin Hu, Co-founder, and CEO at <a href="https://metaplane.dev/"><em>Metaplane</em></a>.  We discuss how their solution brings observability into the data warehouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet is a layer cake of technologies and protocols.  At a fundamental level, the internet runs on the TCP/IP protocol.  It’s a packet based system.  When your browser requests a file from a web server, that server chops up the file into tiny pieces known as packets and puts them on the network labeled with your machine’s address as its destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That system works incredibly well for receiving a file from a web server.  If some of the packets arrive out of order, that’s not a problem.  If one is lost, it can be sent again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no guarantees in a packet based system.  If a flood of new packets show up, the system can slow down and you may experience a lag in the response time.  This can be annoying when visiting a blog that is slow to load, but it’s not a ruined experience.  Streaming video, on the other hand, does not degrade elegantly in this situation.  No consumer wants to have their experience interrupted by a spinning wheel.  Traffic can be spiky and unpredictable, especially around live events.  The stakes are high for building a scalable, effective streaming video solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amit Mishra is a member team at FOX which is responsible for building platform-to-live stream content across all the FOX properties.  In this episode we discuss some of the technical milestones on delivering this platform and why golang was the right choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not matter if it runs on your machine.  Your code must run in the production environment and it must do so performantly.  For that, you need tooling to better understand your application&#8217;s behavior under different circumstances.  In the earliest days of software development, all we had were logs, which are still around and incredibly useful.  You’re likely to also consider Application Performance Monitoring tools or APM.  Observability is an evolving and important feature of any software system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we interview Christine Yen, co-founder, and CEO of Honeycomb.io.  We talk about getting her start in software, meeting her co-founder while working at Parse, and how some of the experiences shared there shaped their vision for an idealized tool for figuring out what’s happening with your system.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern business applications are complex.  It&#8217;s not enough to have raw logs or some basic telemetry.  Today&#8217;s enterprise organizations require an application performance monitoring solution or APM.  Today&#8217;s applications are complex distributed systems whose performance depends on a wide variety of factors.  Every single line of code can affect production and teams need insights into the health of the system and how to improve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, I interview Omri Sass and Hugo Kaczmarek from Datadog, a provider of cloud monitoring as a service.  We discuss the APM space and the challenges faced by modern enterprise teams.  We also get into some detail about their new live search option and why that solution was an important addition to their product suite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first industrial deployments of machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions were bespoke by definition and often had brittle operating characteristics.  Almost no one builds custom databases, web servers, or email clients.  Yet technology groups today often consider developing homegrown ML and data solutions in order to solve their unique use cases.  Today’s modern data stack is a patchwork of interconnecting tools built to suit a variety of personas that need to interact with the data in notably different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, I speak with Leigh Marie Braswell, an Investor with Founders Fund.  We have a wide-ranging discussion about the technology landscape of data and machine learning solutions and the modern enterprise data stack.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">In a version control system, a Monorepo is a version control management strategy in which all your code is contained in one potentially large but complete repository.  The monorepo is in stark contrast to an alternative approach in which software teams independently manage microservices or deliver software as libraries to be imported in other projects.  The monorepo strategy has been followed by noteworthy companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Derrick Stolee is a software engineer working at GitHub.  He joins us today to talk about strategies for monorepos and innovations to the way git works in order to better support this style of the repository.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern companies leverage dozens or even hundreds of software solutions to solve specific needs of the business.  Organizations need to collect all these disparate data sources into a data warehouse in order to add value.  The raw data typically needs transformation before it can be analyzed.  In many cases, companies develop homegrown solutions, thus reinventing the wheel and possibly planting deep rooted seeds of technical debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozart Data helps you collect all of your data sources in under an hour.  They provide managed data pipelines, data warehousing, and transformation automation.  In this episode, I interview CEO Peter Fishman and CTO Dan Silberman about the modern data stack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether sending messages, shopping in an app, or watching videos, modern consumers expect information and responsiveness to be near-instant in their apps and devices. From a developer’s perspective, this means clean code and a fast database. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apache Druid is a database built to power real-time analytic workloads for event-driven data, like user-facing applications, streaming, and anything else that requires instant data visibility. Druid offers lower latency for OLAP-style queries, time-based partitioning, fast search and filter, and out-of-the-box integration with Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, HDFS, AWS S3, and more (</span><a href="https://druid.apache.org/faq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Druid.apache.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we talk with Eric Tschetter, Field CTO at Imply, Fellow at Splunk, and experience developing large swaths of backend infrastructure largely focusing on Druid. We discuss the use cases and power of Apache Druid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise data warehouses store all company data in a single place to be accessed, queried, and analyzed. They’re essential for business operations because they support managing data from multiple sources, providing context, and have built-in analytics tools. While keeping a single source of truth is important, easily moving data from the warehouse to other applications is invaluable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company <a href="https://hightouch.com/">Hightouch</a> provides tools that easily move data from your warehouse to important business tools like Salesforce, Apache Airflow, Tableau and more. Hightouch uses SQL to move and transform your data and tracks every row to avoid moving data that hasn’t changed. Failed rows are retried, and all changes to rows are logged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we talk to Tejas Manohar, Founder of Hightouch. We talk about reverse ETL, managing data across multiple systems, and how Hightouch helps companies operationalize their data warehouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2003, Google developed a robust cluster management system called Borg. This enabled them to manage clusters with tens of thousands of machines, moving them away from virtual machines and firmly into container management. Then,</span><a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-kubernetes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they open sourced a version of Borg called Kubernetes, or K8s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in 2021, CockroachDB is a distributed database designed with Kubernetes architecture in mind. CockroachDB uses regular SQL and scales by automatically distributing data and workload demands. Their databases survive machine, datacenter, and region failures, and provide guaranteed ACID compliant transactions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we talk to Spencer Kimball, CEO at Cockroach Labs, about distributed databases and containerization.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data analytics is the process of collecting data, processing and cleaning it, then analyzing it with techniques like data mining, predictive analytics, and deep learning. This process requires a suite of tools to operate efficiently. Data analytics can save companies money, drive product development, and give insight into the market and customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Imply provides the necessary tools for safe and efficient large scale analytic workloads. Their tools help minimize operational complexity so that deploying container clusters, or bare metal, or public and hybrid clouds is simple. Infra also monitors their performance, uptime, and scale. They also create fully interactive visualizations that update with real-time data, and plenty of other tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we talk with Jad Naous, VP of Engineering and Product at Imply, about big data analysis and real-world use cases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps has shortened the development life cycle for countless applications and is embraced by companies around the world. But managing and monitoring multiple environments is still a major pain point, particularly when companies need to mix cloud and legacy systems. Knowing when services go down and quickly pinpointing the cause is essential for continuous development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Better Stack provides services for DevOps teams. Their first service, Logtail, provides SQL-compatible structured log management. Query logs like you query a database. Their second service, Better Uptime, is an infrastructure monitoring platform that monitors uptime and, when issues occur, sends voice calls, SMS, and plenty other types of alerts with screenshots and error logs of the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juraj Masar, Co-Founder and CEO at Better Stack, joins us to discuss DevOps and Better Stack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data has exploded the past decade as cloud computing and more efficient hardware made scaling essentially limitless. Products like Uber revolve entirely around analyzing data to provide rides. According to an </span><a href="https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom/announcements/2012/12/20121211-01.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMC/IDC study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was approximately 5.2TB of data for every person in 2020. That estimate was made before the transition to remote work, which likely makes it much higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “data lineage” refers to the collection, origin, storage, transfer, and use of data over time. Given the size of the Big Data industry and related industries, maintaining a thorough data lineage, even within small companies, can be very difficult. It becomes especially challenging at scale. What innovative tools make understanding all this information possible? Can data really continue growing at this rate?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous integration is a coding practice where engineers deliver incremental and frequent code changes to create higher quality software and collaborate more. Teams attempting to continuously integrate new code need a consistent and automated pipeline for reviewing, testing, and deploying the changes. Otherwise change requests pile up in the queue and nothing gets integrated efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company LayerCI is a platform built to deliver a better remote infrastructure experience. It enables engineers to preview full stack staging environments for every commit and have a centralized CI/CD stack with full end-to-end testing. LayerCI can duplicate a fully provisioned environment so that end-to-end workflows can run in parallel and alongside unit tests. The result is faster code review, testing and deployment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELT is a process for copying data from a source system into a target system. It stands for “Extract, Load, Transform” and starts with extracting a copy of data from the source location. It’s loaded into the target system like a data warehouse, and then it’s ready to be transformed into a usable format for things like modern cloud applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Meltano provides code that manages ELT pipelines through an open-source, self-hosted, CLI-first, debuggable, and extensible process. Meltano projects manage your Singer tap and target configurations to easily select which entities and attributes to extract. These pipelines track their own incremental replication state so they can pick up where the previous run left off. Once your raw data is in its target source, Meltano helps you transform it into a usable format. These pipelines can run on a schedule and be fed to supported orchestrators like Apache Airflow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we talk to Douwe Maan, founder and CEO of Meltano, about their product-market fit and delivery plans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is one of many examples we’ve discussed on this show that has changed the world with big data analysis. With over 8 million users, 1 billion Uber trips and people driving for Uber in over 400 cities and 66 countries, Uber has redefined an entire industry in a very short time frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s difficult to find precise details about Uber’s big data infrastructure online, but we know they collect every possible data point about their drivers and riders. Matching riders and drivers, setting ride fares, predicting demand for cars &#8211; these are some examples of what Uber does with its data. In this episode we talk with Kevin Novak about Uber’s data science. What are some key details about their data infrastructure? What can people expect in the future from their data methodologies?  How did a tech conference in Paris turn into one of the fastest growing, highest valued startups in the world?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity and quality of a company’s data can mean the difference between a major success or major failure. Companies like Google have used big data from its earliest days to steer their product suite in the direction consumers need. Other companies, like Apple, didn’t always use big data analytics to drive product design, </span><a href="https://socpub.com/articles/how-apple-is-using-big-data-13719"><span style="font-weight: 400;">but they do now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Axiom has created a large suite of advanced browser robots that perform difficult tasks like consolidating data across many web applications, extracting data from public sites or from behind logins, data entry, user interface automation, file management and spreadsheet automation. These powerful tools enable people and businesses to collect valuable data to inform their decisions. In this episode we talk to Yaseer Sheriff, Co-Founder and CEO at Axiom. We discuss the value of big data, the opportunities their products enable, and how people can use their tools to improve their data collection practices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud data warehouses are databases hosted in cloud environments. They provide typical benefits of the cloud like flexible data access, scalability, and performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Firebolt provides a cloud data warehouse built for modern data environments. It decouples storage and compute to operate on top of existing data lakes like S3. It computes orders of magnitude faster performance from gigabyte to petabyte scale by using a columnar data structure, vectorized processing, just-in-time query compilation, and continuously aggregated indexing. Firebolt scales with data lakes by processing queries across clusters of nodes in parallel, providing consistently fast processing and granular control over resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we talk with Eldad Farkash, Co-Founder and CEO of <a href="http://firebolt.io">Firebolt</a>. Eldad was previously a Venture Partner at Angular Ventures and a Founder, CTO and Board Member at Sisense before that. We discuss big data, data warehouses, and the unique benefits offered by Firebolt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apache Hudi is an open-source data management framework used to simplify incremental data processing and data pipeline development. This framework more efficiently manages business requirements like data lifecycle and improves data quality. Some common use cases for Hudi is record-level insert, update, and delete, simplified file management and near real-time data access, and simplified CDC data pipeline development (</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/hudi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS.amazon.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we speak to Vinoth Chandar, VP of Apache Hudi. Vinoth is the creator of the Hudi project at Uber.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Application Programming Interface, API for short, is the connector between 2 applications. For example, a user interface that needs user data will call an endpoint, like a special URL, with request parameters and receive the data back if the request is valid. Modern applications rely on APIs to send data back and forth to each other and save, edit, delete, or retrieve data in databases. The number of APIs used in a single application is growing due to the increase of micro-services and distributed architectures. Understanding how your applications use APIs can increase their efficiency and stability and make debugging easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Akita observes the structure of programs to visualize, map, and manage API behavior. By monitoring the APIs in your applications, Akita can catch code changes that may break production applications. While this work is normally labor-intensive, Akita automates it by analyzing the API traffic. They check the observed behaviors against intended specs and contracts to provide clear oversight on all activity. This information can then be generated into maps that help you document and version your APIs across your entire service ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we talk with Jean Yang, Founder and CEO of Akita Software. Jean was previously an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a postdoctoral researcher and Harvard Medical School before that. We discuss modern APIs, their role in applications, and how Akita Software makes understanding and building APIs easier for developers. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traveling salesman problem is a classic challenge of finding the shortest and most efficient route for a person to take given a list of destinations. This is one of many real-world optimization problems that companies encounter. How should they schedule product distribution, or promote product bundles, or define sales territories? The answers to these questions constantly change because business environments constantly change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Nextmv helps solve these problems with production-ready, commercial tools for solving optimization problems and simulating models with real company data. Their tool Hop encodes optimization strategies for dynamic environments. Hope can be deployed to routing, scheduling and assignment problems in multiple industries like on-demand delivery, e-commerce, and IT infrastructure management. Their tool Dash is a commercial-grade simulation engine that provides an environment to “A/B test” models online with real data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we talk to Carolyn Mooney, CEO at Nextmv. Carolyn was previously a Lead Systems Engineer at Grubhub, and a Decision System Analyst at Zoomer before that. We discuss optimization problems throughout different industries, machine learning strategies for solving them, and go into detail about how Nextmv helps companies become more profitable and efficient.</span></p>
