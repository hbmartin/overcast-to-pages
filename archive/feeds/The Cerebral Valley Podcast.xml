And as Waymo fans, we&amp;#39;re excited about their expansion in to Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced by &lt;a href=&quot;crgconsulting.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferer&quot;&gt;Christopher Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re opening in a celebratory mood this week with Wiz&#39;s big exit to Google, which if it holds will offer some much needed liquidity to venture firms and their LPs. It&#39;s a big win for several of Silicon Valley&#39;s heavy hitters, including Sequoia&#39;s Doug Leone, Index Ventures&#39; Shardul Shah, and Greenoaks&#39; Neil Mehta. IPOs are looking a little bit more uncertain, however. Plus, Deel&#39;s allleged corporate espionage at Rippling has all the makings of a great HR tech spy thriller. Next up, we touch on the new liberal &quot;abundance&quot; agenda, which has more than a few similarities to Marc Andreessen&#39;s &quot;Time to Build&quot; manifesto. In the second half of our show, Eric sits down with <a href="https://stageh.link/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Browserbase</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulkleiniv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Paul Klein</a> to discuss their tools for running headless browsers and their rapid growth over the past year.</p><p><br></p><p>Produced by <a href="crgconsulting.com" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">⁠Christopher Gates⁠</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Newcomer Podcast, Eric and Madeline dissect why VCs are mad about Trump’s plans for a strategic crypto reserve. Even the biggest boosters and loudest voices for deregulation around crypto have been caught off guard by the president’s push to add other altcoins to the promised Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, calling the move a blatant enrichment scheme for coin holders and friends of the President. </p><p>Next, they take a closer look at the thawing of the IPO market. They unpack CoreWeave’s S-1 and examine why the biggest generative AI IPO of the year so far has a lot at stake with big tech customers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Eric and Madeline break down the week that was in AI news in this episode of <em>The Newcomer Podcast, </em>from the unnecessary panic caused by reports of Microsoft cancelling leases for data centers to Nvidia’s quarterly earnings report. Despite tech companies moving full steam ahead on AI, including OpenAI’s launch of GPT 4.5 and Softbank’s $200 billion commitment to data centers, tech stocks dropped, which our hosts blame on the natural slower tech adoption curve and overall market uncertainty from President Trump’s chaotic policy changes.</p><p>Later in the episode, Eric unpacks Jeff Bezos’ increasing control over the <em>Washington Post’s </em>opinion section and tech CEOs pre-empting so-called “hit pieces” on X. The two then shout out UK-based developer tool Lovable’s $15 funding million extension and rapid growth. They close the episode with a call for readers to submit their burning questions and commentary for next week’s <em>Newcomer </em>reader mailbag.

			<title><![CDATA[Has AI Hit a Wall? A Debate from the Cerebral Valley AI Summit]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been spending some of the afternoon chatting with OpenAI’s now fully released o1. So far, I don’t know that it feels like the super intelligent ChatGPT 5 that we’ve all fantasized about — but it’s smart and sophisticated. The new model helped me to game out potential stories and talk through problems. And of course it wrote me a poem and told me a couple dad jokes.</p><p>It looks like the biggest improvement in the news model may be in math and coding, where OpenAI is highlighting meaningful improvements over o1-preview.</p><p>It will take some time to digest the new version of the model and see what it says about the pace of AI advancement. </p><p>Before the latest update, <strong>Max Child</strong>, <strong>James Wilsterman</strong>, and I got behind our microphones to reflect on the Cerebral Valley AI Summit and give you some of our takeaways. </p><p>(Max has already hooked up the advanced voice mode of ChatGPT to his iPhone action button.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been spending some of the afternoon chatting with OpenAI’s now fully released o1. So far, I don’t know that it feels like the super intelligent ChatGPT 5 that we’ve all fantasized about — but it’s smart and sophisticated. The new model helped me to game out potential stories and talk through problems. And of course it wrote me a poem and told me a couple dad jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like the biggest improvement in the news model may be in math and coding, where OpenAI is highlighting meaningful improvements over o1-preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take some time to digest the new version of the model and see what it says about the pace of AI advancement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the latest update, &lt;strong&gt;Max Child&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;James Wilsterman&lt;/strong&gt;, and I got behind our microphones to reflect on the Cerebral Valley AI Summit and give you some of our takeaways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Max has already hooked up the advanced voice mode of ChatGPT to his iPhone action button.

To wrap things up, they call for some balance in Silicon Valley’s escalating discourse around drugs and psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:22 Ujet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:40 PearAI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;05:49 Open AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:45 AI Regulation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16:34 Drugs + SV&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Why Software Is Eating The Banks | Mercury CEO Immad Akhund, Then Lead Bank CEO Jackie Reses]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re highlighting two fireside chats from the Newcomer Banking Summit on March 14. </p><p>First up is Mercury CEO <strong>Immad Akhund</strong>. He talked about how the Silicon Valley Bank crisis sent customers rushing to his digital banking service. </p><p>He pitched a world where software — not human bankers — solve most of customers’ problems. Akhund told me, “My experience with relationship banking was I need to send a wire and I literally cannot figure out to do it, please help me. Which to me never felt like a relationship, it felt very transactional and painful — and with Mercury you don’t have to do that.”  </p><p>Mercury is limited by the fact that it is not a bank — it’s a software company on top of banking partners — at a time when regulators are looking closely at how banks work with fintech partners.</p><p>We concluded our summit with <strong>Jackie Reses</strong> — who was a top executive at Square before leaving to buy a bank. Reses is the CEO of Lead Bank, a regional Kansas City bank that still serves local customers but has built an onramp for financial technology companies to connect with the banking system.</p><p>“The thing I saw at Square — which I consider to be a very strong, innovative fintech — is that owning a bank and operating a bank is a 10X delta in understanding compliance to working in a tech company,” Reses said. At Square, Reses said, she learned to “appreciate the complexity of what it takes to do this, so that we could learn how to serve our clients better and help them scale — but make sure we never put ourselves in the position to risk the relationship that we have operating with our regulators.”</p><p>You can give the episodes a listen or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO4RMQVddw&#38;ab_channel=Newcomer">watch them on YouTube</a>.</p><p>Also: The Future of Banking with Rho, Jiko, and Ripple</p><p>In case you missed it, we’ve posted another panel with three fintech/banking leaders. </p><p>Rho CEO <strong>Everett Cook</strong>, Jiko CEO <strong>Stephane Lintner</strong>, and Ripple President <strong>Monica Long</strong> are all trying to solve shortcomings in the legacy banking system, with different approaches.

			<title><![CDATA[Two Titans on the Future of AI (with Reid Hoffman & Vinod Khosla)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, we have a double episode for you — two conversations from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/">Cerebral Valley AI Summit</a>.</p><p><strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> was fresh off a meeting with President Joe Biden when Hoffman and I sat down on stage at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit Nov. 15. On stage, he told us that working to get Biden elected next year is one of his top priorities. </p><p>Then, I sat down with the ever-feisty <strong>Vinod Khosla</strong>. The investor called for a TikTok ban and more welcoming immigration policies while warning against open-source artificial intelligence projects.</p><p>Thousands of enterprises around the world rely on <strong>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</strong> (OCI) to power applications that drive their businesses. OCI customers include leaders across industries, such as healthcare, scientific research, financial services, telecommunications, and more.</p><p><strong>NVIDIA DGX Cloud on OCI</strong> is an AI training-as-a-service platform for customers to train complex AI models like generative AI applications. Included with DGX Cloud, NVIDIA AI Enterprise brings the software layer of the NVIDIA AI platform to OCI.</p><p>Talk with Oracle about accelerating your GPU workloads.</p><p>Hoffman Plans to Go Big for Biden</p><p>Hoffman, fresh off a meeting with President Biden, kicked off the afternoon with a strong endorsement of the President’s record. Hoffman praised Biden for his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">recent executive</a> order on artificial intelligence. </p><p>Reid called himself “a 95%-98% supporter” of the executive order, endorsing provisions on reporting and monitoring, “red team” testing, and voluntary commitments by companies that might eventually be enforced via the Defense Production Act. But he pushed back on the idea that the FTC should be monitoring the AI industry for anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>“Startups are not being impeded right now,” he asserted, despite the apparent dominance of OpenAI and the mega-cap tech companies. Reid sits on the board of Microsoft, and offered that he was in fact “first money in” on OpenAI, through his personal foundation, but he’s not concerned about, er, his own companies having too much power. “I don’t think it constrains competition on any level.”</p><p>Hoffman is always happy to engage on policy, and I asked him what he thought about <strong>Marc Andreessen’s </strong>recent “techno-optimist” manifesto, which denigrates the very idea of government oversight. Reid said he was a techno-optimist too, and half-joked that Andreessen “quoted kind of liberally from things I’ve written and said” without any attribution. But Hoffman said that he’s not on board with Andreessen’s approach. “It’s kind of dumb to think that when you have major technologies there can’t be negative side effects,” he said, noting that all his AI projects have safety teams. “Tech can be amazing. Let’s be intentional about building.”</p><p>Khosla Wins Cheers from the Cerebral Valley Audience</p><p>Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/khosla-ventures-closes-in-on-3-billion-for-venture-funds-defying-startup-slump-84f5a3fc">confirmed</a> that his firm, boosted by an early stake in OpenAI, was about to close on $3 billion in commitments for a new fund. Valuations are high, he said, “but just because valuations are high doesn’t mean it isn’t a good time to invest.”</p><p>He’s not buying existential risk, calling it “nonsensical” talk from academics who had nothing better to do. But he’s long on China risk, saying the U.S. is in a “techno-economic war” with China and needs to fight hard. “I would ban TikTok in a nano-second,” he said, unlike his predecessor on stage, Hoffman, who Khosla said he very much admired. Khosla is firmly against open-source AI models as well due to the China risk.</p><p>Bio-risk and cyber risk are real concerns too, he noted.</p><p>But if China or rogue viruses don’t kill us, Khosla thinks the near-future is very bright: “I do think in 10 years we’ll have free doctors, free tutors, free lawyers” all powered by AI. </p><p>Khosla also gave a grudging endorsement of the Biden Executive Order, saying it was “okay.” </p><p>But like most Silicon Valley moguls, he has no time for antitrust issues. “We have to get people like Khan out of there,” he said, referring to the chair of the FTC (though misstating her name), calling her “crazy, left-wing.”   </p><p>Khosla said he’s long believed that AI would force us to “redefine what it is to me human.”</p><p>Meantime he himself plans another 25 years of VC investing, and if all goes well, maybe more. </p><p>Give it a listen</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

Khosla is firmly against open-source AI models as well due to the China risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bio-risk and cyber risk are real concerns too, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if China or rogue viruses don’t kill us, Khosla thinks the near-future is very bright: “I do think in 10 years we’ll have free doctors, free tutors, free lawyers” all powered by AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khosla also gave a grudging endorsement of the Biden Executive Order, saying it was “okay.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like most Silicon Valley moguls, he has no time for antitrust issues. “We have to get people like Khan out of there,” he said, referring to the chair of the FTC (though misstating her name), calling her “crazy, left-wing.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khosla said he’s long believed that AI would force us to “redefine what it is to me human.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meantime he himself plans another 25 years of VC investing, and if all goes well, maybe more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Someday That NPC Could Be More Alive Than You Are (w/ Amy Wu & Keith Kawahata)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Video games often represent the frontier of any new technology. Many of the most popular applications in the initial iPhone app store were games. Today’s virtual reality devices are dominated by video games. </p><p>Artificial intelligence seems poised to upend the video game business and entertainment more broadly.</p><p>On the third episode of our six-part <em>Cerebral Valley</em> podcast series, <strong>Max Child</strong>, <strong>James Wilsterman</strong>, and I game out how artificial intelligence could reshape the media we consume. </p><p>It helps that Max and James are the co-founders of Volley, which builds AI-enabled games. They develop many of the most popular voice games on the Amazon Alexa and smart TV platforms like Roku. </p><p>Max and James have been deep in the trenches of conversational-style gaming and have spent a lot of time thinking about how humans interact with ever smarter computers.</p><p>In the second half of the episode, I talk with Menlo Ventures partner <strong>Amy Wu</strong>, who focuses on gaming and consumer investments, and <strong>Keith Kawahata</strong>, a former executive at Wargaming, AppLovin, and Kabam, who now has a stealth artificial intelligence gaming startup. </p><p>Wu helps to articulate a three-part thesis on how artificial intelligence might change the gaming business. (1) artificial intelligence will help with the creation of the game art and graphics, (2) AI can create more sophisticated non-player characters, and (3) AI can help write the code of the game itself.</p><p>One of the things that I was struck by from the conversation is that games may have a big leg up in implementing artificial intelligence over movies — because people interact so much more with a gaming, giving it tons of data to react to. While TikToks can learn what small populations of people like and what an individual likes over a long time, a game could learn a lot about a user in a single play session.</p><p>Of course, there are real hurdles left standing. Most notably, text-to-image generation so far is mostly two-dimensional. Despite everything that’s happened, image generation models aren’t just whipping out 3-D levels that are ready to play. </p><p>And it could be a while until non-player characters are as smart as humans. But imagine playing a game of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption and the characters roaming around the game are self-aware agents with their own thoughts and drives. </p><p>Give it a listen</p><p><em>P.S. I’m on my honeymoon right now in Japan. I was working frantically to record these episodes before I left. My chief of staff Riley Konsella is sending the episodes out for me while I’m gone.</em> <em>If you need anything while I’m away, you should </em><a target="_blank" href="mailto:riley@newcomer.co"><em>email Riley</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Thanks in advance for being understanding that this newsletter is slowing down for my honeymoon. I’m going to dedicate myself to relaxing over the next two weeks so that I come back hungrier than ever.</em></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

Today’s virtual reality devices are dominated by video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence seems poised to upend the video game business and entertainment more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third episode of our six-part &lt;em&gt;Cerebral Valley&lt;/em&gt; podcast series, &lt;strong&gt;Max Child&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;James Wilsterman&lt;/strong&gt;, and I game out how artificial intelligence could reshape the media we consume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps that Max and James are the co-founders of Volley, which builds AI-enabled games. They develop many of the most popular voice games on the Amazon Alexa and smart TV platforms like Roku. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max and James have been deep in the trenches of conversational-style gaming and have spent a lot of time thinking about how humans interact with ever smarter computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the episode, I talk with Menlo Ventures partner &lt;strong&gt;Amy Wu&lt;/strong&gt;, who focuses on gaming and consumer investments, and &lt;strong&gt;Keith Kawahata&lt;/strong&gt;, a former executive at Wargaming, AppLovin, and Kabam, who now has a stealth artificial intelligence gaming startup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu helps to articulate a three-part thesis on how artificial intelligence might change the gaming business. (1) artificial intelligence will help with the creation of the game art and graphics, (2) AI can create more sophisticated non-player characters, and (3) AI can help write the code of the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I was struck by from the conversation is that games may have a big leg up in implementing artificial intelligence over movies — because people interact so much more with a gaming, giving it tons of data to react to. While TikToks can learn what small populations of people like and what an individual likes over a long time, a game could learn a lot about a user in a single play session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are real hurdles left standing. Most notably, text-to-image generation so far is mostly two-dimensional. Despite everything that’s happened, image generation models aren’t just whipping out 3-D levels that are ready to play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it could be a while until non-player characters are as smart as humans. But imagine playing a game of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption and the characters roaming around the game are self-aware agents with their own thoughts and drives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I’m on my honeymoon right now in Japan. I was working frantically to record these episodes before I left. My chief of staff Riley Konsella is sending the episodes out for me while I’m gone.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you need anything while I’m away, you should &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:riley@newcomer.co&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;email Riley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks in advance for being understanding that this newsletter is slowing down for my honeymoon.

			<title><![CDATA[Life Extension Innovations, Moonshots & Snake Oil (with Celine Halioua & James Peyer)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I brought two top Silicon Valley entrepreneurs working on extending lifespans on the <em>Newcomer </em>podcast this week. </p><p>One of them is trying to help people live longer. The other, their dogs.</p><p><strong>James Peyer</strong>, the CEO of Cambrian Bio, is acquiring majority stakes in drugs that  could combat a particular illness while showing promise for broader use among healthy humans.

He joined Airbnb to run policy and communications. He taught the home sharing company how to fight nicely with cities, dishing out data and tax cooperation in exchange for favorable local regulations. Unlike Uber’s confrontational approach that had it going to war with <strong>Bill de Blasio</strong> in New York City, Airbnb tried to foster a cozy relationship with urban policymakers.Airbnb CEO <strong>Brian Chesky</strong> and President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> built a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.obama.org/discover/press-releases/the-obamas-and-brian-chesky-announce-the-second-cohort-of-voyager-scholarship-for-public-service-recipients/">tight</a> relationship. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/8ff180?rc=iatd7y">A year ago</a>, just as the crypto winter was starting, Lehane joined <strong>Katie Haun’s</strong> self-named venture fund, which had raised $1.5 billion. Haun Ventures positioned itself as a leader in regulation, policy, and communications. Haun is a former assistant U.S. attorney. <strong>Rachael Horwitz</strong>, the firm’s chief marketing officer, once ran communications for Coinbase. And Lehane brought the political experience, especially with Democrats. </p><p>But there’s only so much one firm can do to change crypto’s reputation in Washington, especially with Democrats. <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the former CEO of FTX, had become the crypto world’s standard bearer with Democrats, donating to their campaigns and speaking to their values. Then when Bankman-Fried’s empire unraveled and he headed to jail, many Democrats grew disillusioned with crypto. </p><p>This year, two Republican-led House committees <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-congressional-committee-set-weigh-crypto-bills-2023-07-26/#:~:text=The%20bill%20passed%20by%20the,jurisdiction%2C%20as%20many%20crypto%20advocates">moved forward</a> crypto-friendly legislation that would clarify the regulation of crypto currencies and give the Commodities Futures Trading Commission more power to regulate crypto (denying the SEC some of that power).

			<title><![CDATA[He Helps Rich Tech Founders Part With Their Money (with Rey Flemings)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I spend most of my time here talking about how people <em>earn</em> their money.</p><p><strong>Rey Flemings</strong>, the chief executive of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/myria">YC-backed</a> startup Myria, is an expert at helping people <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjm9z/the-man-who-knows-what-the-worlds-richest-people-want-and-how-to-get-it"><em>spend</em></a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjm9z/the-man-who-knows-what-the-worlds-richest-people-want-and-how-to-get-it"> it</a>. </p><p>For several <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyflemings/">years</a>, Flemings ran a luxury services consultancy for family offices. In other words, he threw parties in Las Vegas, introduced billionaires to celebrities, rented out private mansions, and helped people acquire things money can’t usually buy. </p><p>These days, Flemings is building a startup around the same concept. Letting rich people buy what isn’t on the market. He’s building a marketplace for off-market travel and accommodations. On top of that, he’s spinning up a social network for the ultra wealthy. </p><p>Flemings <a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/26/the-worlds-richest-people-use-this-top-secret-ultra-exclusive-app-we-got-access/">says</a> his average member’s net worth is about $600 million. </p><p>I sat down with Flemings to talk about his startup and to understand how Silicon Valley’s most successful people are spending the fantastical sums that they’ve earned in the past few years. </p><p>He warned about the unhappiness that sudden fortune can bring, calling it “the success condition.”</p><p>We’re all humans. We’re all chasing the American Dream. We’re all chasing success. And when you achieve it, one of the first discoveries that people are shocked by is that you have to pump the brakes. Money doesn’t buy happiness. I was talking with a new client the other day and he said, “Ray, I can’t talk about this publicly, the world would play the world’s smallest violin, but the day I exited triggered the deepest and greatest period of depression in my life.”</p><p>Give it a listen.</p><p>Highlighted Excerpts</p><p><em>The transcript has been edited for clarity.</em></p><p>There is a phenomenon in Silicon Valley where someone suddenly becomes rich, especially when their entire net worth is tied up in a startup. Finally, they sell the company and now have all this money, but don't really know how to be wealthy or what to buy. What typically happens when somebody sells their company for a billion dollars and gets 300 million of it?</p><p><strong>Rey Flemings: </strong>First of all, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, right? We’re different. Significant, sudden, great wealth does come with a particular set of challenges. Zooming out across 15-17 years in this space and looking at all of the folks that work here, zoom all the way out. Let’s just focus on first-generation people who are operating a business and/or they’re doing something presently to amass that wealth. I’ve worked with probably 100-125 folks in that category. I hear the same things over and over, so often that we have even coined a name for it — we call it the <em>Success Condition.</em></p><p>It goes something like this: We’re all humans. We’re all chasing the American Dream. We’re all chasing success. And when you achieve it, one of the first discoveries that people are shocked by is that you have to pump the brakes. Money doesn’t buy happiness. I was talking with a new client the other day and he said, “Ray, I can’t talk about this publicly, the world would play the world’s smallest violin, but the day I exited triggered the deepest and greatest period of depression in my life.”</p><p>What ends up happening is we chase the American Dream only to realize it and then we’re like “Wait, why am I not happy? What’s missing here?” </p><p>Rich people get sad, depressed and commit suicide just like anyone else. Studies show that beyond about $100,000 a year, any more money doesn’t actually contribute to human happiness. The wealthier and more successful you become, the harder it is to form close interpersonal relationships with people that aren’t in your network.</p><p>Break down what was the motivation to do Y Combinator and build more of a tech platform for Myria?</p><p><strong>Rey: </strong>Fantastic question, Eric. I’d love to sound like I had this all planned out and was so smart with so much foresight. I knew I wanted to build a scalable business with my background. But when I started The Blue, I ran it for 5-6 years before we could start Myria. It was complicated. How do you scale services? Many say you can’t scale services. If so, what do you scale and how? How do you keep customers happy who want white glove service and personalization? How do you provide that special touch at scale? These are really hard problems to solve.</p><p>I grew that business bootstrapped to about $60 million GMV annually. If you do that, you stay busy. I didn’t know my kids, family, or myself. I was always on a plane, just work, work, work. That’s not sustainable.</p><p>At least you get to go to parties sometimes?</p><p><strong>Rey: </strong>Yeah, almost always in that business. I just celebrated my 50th birthday. I don’t have to tell you I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life on a plane in a suit. That’s no way to live.</p><p>It turns out that when we started Myria, we asked clients what they wanted. Ninety-two percent of requests fell into just three categories. </p><p>People wanted our global travel product — not just booking a flight or kayak to Toledo. Really crazy, experiential travel beyond a private jet. When you get off the private jet, what happens? The best things in the world you can’t find on Google. If you can’t search for them, how do you know what’s on the menu? There’s a whole universe of off-market awesomeness in every category, but no one tells you about them because they aren’t online.</p><p>Travel experiences, people, and assets. When you’re running a big company, you have an amazing team. When you hit $300 million net worth, you probably move to a single family office with teams managing your wealth. But for your personal life, even with household employees, you want to relax at home. A person worth $3 billion wouldn’t run their company with one person, but their personal life becomes a multi-billion dollar enterprise with homes, kids, divorce, assets everywhere. Assistants work hard but can’t be experts in everything billionaires need help in.</p><p>We asked clients what they wanted and 92% of requests were in three categories. Also, there are about 20 markets ultra wealthy care about. If we have great coverage in those categories in those markets, we’ve covered nearly all use cases.</p><p>I’ve always wondered — if I’m at Bezos’ level of wealth, do I try to get everybody who interacts with me to sign an NDA? Especially if I’m out partying on a yacht, is everybody at that party signing something to keep things confidential?</p><p><strong>Rey: </strong>On the Myria platform, everyone who sells to our members is automatically under binding arbitration. The wealthy are targets for frivolous litigation. We try to prevent that.</p><p>In real life, if you’re hosting a party, many will request or demand NDAs and lock up phones, like Dave Chappelle style with magnetically locked bags. I think that’s good considering phone addiction. You’ve thrown a million dollar party for people’s enjoyment but they just look at their phones. But there are gaps. I can share a horror story.</p><p>We did an expensive, innocent party at an incredible estate with famous people relaxing and having fun — nothing unprintable. But no one wanted cameras in their face while relaxing Someone who signed the NDA went to the press implying we discriminated by only having women sign NDAs, not the men. The men were dear friends of the client, so they didn't have to sign. Sometimes NDAs can backfire.</p><p>Do you require NDAs for everything?</p><p><strong>Rey: </strong>We try to on the platform but nothing substitutes for having a good group of trustworthy people, which is harder as you become more successful. It’s become a sport to vilify the rich, making it harder to form close relationships outside your network.</p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my time here talking about how people &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey Flemings&lt;/strong&gt;, the chief executive of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/myria&quot;&gt;YC-backed&lt;/a&gt; startup Myria, is an expert at helping people &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjm9z/the-man-who-knows-what-the-worlds-richest-people-want-and-how-to-get-it&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;spend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjm9z/the-man-who-knows-what-the-worlds-richest-people-want-and-how-to-get-it&quot;&gt; it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyflemings/&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, Flemings ran a luxury services consultancy for family offices. In other words, he threw parties in Las Vegas, introduced billionaires to celebrities, rented out private mansions, and helped people acquire things money can’t usually buy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Flemings is building a startup around the same concept. Letting rich people buy what isn’t on the market. He’s building a marketplace for off-market travel and accommodations. On top of that, he’s spinning up a social network for the ultra wealthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flemings &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/08/26/the-worlds-richest-people-use-this-top-secret-ultra-exclusive-app-we-got-access/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; his average member’s net worth is about $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down with Flemings to talk about his startup and to understand how Silicon Valley’s most successful people are spending the fantastical sums that they’ve earned in the past few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warned about the unhappiness that sudden fortune can bring, calling it “the success condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all humans. We’re all chasing the American Dream. We’re all chasing success. And when you achieve it, one of the first discoveries that people are shocked by is that you have to pump the brakes. Money doesn’t buy happiness. I was talking with a new client the other day and he said, “Ray, I can’t talk about this publicly, the world would play the world’s smallest violin, but the day I exited triggered the deepest and greatest period of depression in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighted Excerpts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The transcript has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a phenomenon in Silicon Valley where someone suddenly becomes rich, especially when their entire net worth is tied up in a startup. Finally, they sell the company and now have all this money, but don&apos;t really know how to be wealthy or what to buy. What typically happens when somebody sells their company for a billion dollars and gets 300 million of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey Flemings: &lt;/strong&gt;First of all, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, right? We’re different. Significant, sudden, great wealth does come with a particular set of challenges. Zooming out across 15-17 years in this space and looking at all of the folks that work here, zoom all the way out. Let’s just focus on first-generation people who are operating a business and/or they’re doing something presently to amass that wealth. I’ve worked with probably 100-125 folks in that category. I hear the same things over and over, so often that we have even coined a name for it — we call it the &lt;em&gt;Success Condition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes something like this: We’re all humans. We’re all chasing the American Dream. We’re all chasing success. And when you achieve it, one of the first discoveries that people are shocked by is that you have to pump the brakes. Money doesn’t buy happiness. I was talking with a new client the other day and he said, “Ray, I can’t talk about this publicly, the world would play the world’s smallest violin, but the day I exited triggered the deepest and greatest period of depression in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ends up happening is we chase the American Dream only to realize it and then we’re like “Wait, why am I not happy? What’s missing here?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich people get sad, depressed and commit suicide just like anyone else. Studies show that beyond about $100,000 a year, any more money doesn’t actually contribute to human happiness. The wealthier and more successful you become, the harder it is to form close interpersonal relationships with people that aren’t in your network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break down what was the motivation to do Y Combinator and build more of a tech platform for Myria?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey: &lt;/strong&gt;Fantastic question, Eric. I’d love to sound like I had this all planned out and was so smart with so much foresight. I knew I wanted to build a scalable business with my background. But when I started The Blue, I ran it for 5-6 years before we could start Myria. It was complicated. How do you scale services? Many say you can’t scale services. If so, what do you scale and how? How do you keep customers happy who want white glove service and personalization? How do you provide that special touch at scale? These are really hard problems to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew that business bootstrapped to about $60 million GMV annually. If you do that, you stay busy. I didn’t know my kids, family, or myself. I was always on a plane, just work, work, work. That’s not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least you get to go to parties sometimes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, almost always in that business. I just celebrated my 50th birthday. I don’t have to tell you I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life on a plane in a suit. That’s no way to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that when we started Myria, we asked clients what they wanted. Ninety-two percent of requests fell into just three categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wanted our global travel product — not just booking a flight or kayak to Toledo. Really crazy, experiential travel beyond a private jet. When you get off the private jet, what happens? The best things in the world you can’t find on Google. If you can’t search for them, how do you know what’s on the menu? There’s a whole universe of off-market awesomeness in every category, but no one tells you about them because they aren’t online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel experiences, people, and assets. When you’re running a big company, you have an amazing team. When you hit $300 million net worth, you probably move to a single family office with teams managing your wealth. But for your personal life, even with household employees, you want to relax at home. A person worth $3 billion wouldn’t run their company with one person, but their personal life becomes a multi-billion dollar enterprise with homes, kids, divorce, assets everywhere. Assistants work hard but can’t be experts in everything billionaires need help in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked clients what they wanted and 92% of requests were in three categories. Also, there are about 20 markets ultra wealthy care about. If we have great coverage in those categories in those markets, we’ve covered nearly all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wondered — if I’m at Bezos’ level of wealth, do I try to get everybody who interacts with me to sign an NDA? Especially if I’m out partying on a yacht, is everybody at that party signing something to keep things confidential?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey: &lt;/strong&gt;On the Myria platform, everyone who sells to our members is automatically under binding arbitration. The wealthy are targets for frivolous litigation. We try to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In real life, if you’re hosting a party, many will request or demand NDAs and lock up phones, like Dave Chappelle style with magnetically locked bags. I think that’s good considering phone addiction. You’ve thrown a million dollar party for people’s enjoyment but they just look at their phones. But there are gaps. I can share a horror story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did an expensive, innocent party at an incredible estate with famous people relaxing and having fun — nothing unprintable. But no one wanted cameras in their face while relaxing Someone who signed the NDA went to the press implying we discriminated by only having women sign NDAs, not the men. The men were dear friends of the client, so they didn&apos;t have to sign. Sometimes NDAs can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you require NDAs for everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey: &lt;/strong&gt;We try to on the platform but nothing substitutes for having a good group of trustworthy people, which is harder as you become more successful. It’s become a sport to vilify the rich, making it harder to form close relationships outside your network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Hydrogen Space Balloon (with Jane Poynter & Ali Rohde)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jane Poynter</strong> spent two years and 20 minutes in a biosphere back in the early 1990s. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlrbOSA5zQI">There’s a documentary about it</a>.) </p><p>Later, Poynter <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/paragon-profile/">set her </a>sights on a mission to Mars. <em>Wired </em>wrote in 2014, “Meet the Couple Who Could Be the First Humans to Travel to Mars.” The story was about Poynter and her husband, <strong>Taber MacCallum</strong>. </p><p>These days, the duo is working together on building a hydrogen balloon that will take tourists to space for $125,000. Poytner came on the podcast to talk about her startup, Space Perspective. We also discussed SpaceX, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, Virgin Galactic, and the state of the adventure tourism industry in light of the deep sea deaths on a OceanGate submersible headed to the Titanic. </p><p>On the show, Poynter said that Space Perspective, which has about 130 employees, has raised almost $70 million. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.primemoverslab.com/">Prime Movers Lab</a> and LightShed Ventures are major investors, Poynter said. She told us that she hopes to commercial operations “around the end of 2024.” </p><p>Venture capitalist, <a target="_blank" href="https://alirohdejobs.substack.com/">chief of staff newsletter author</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/thursdaynightsinaiwithwaseemdah7090774044253306880/comments/">AI event host</a> <strong>Ali Rohde </strong>joined me as a guest co-host for the episode. (She’s a friend of the show and I’m exploring different podcast episode formats. I always <a target="_blank" href="mailto:eric@newcomer.co">welcome your feedback and advice</a>. In that spirit, I’ll mention that I’m <a target="_blank" href="mailto:eric@newcomer.co">still looking</a> for a podcast producer.)</p><p>Think of the episode as part two in my exploration of space startups. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/spaceman-explains-to-earthman-how#details">Last week</a>, I talked with <strong>Delian Asparouhov</strong>, the co-founder of Varda Space Industries. </p><p>This week, we interrogate space tourism. Give it a listen.</p><p>Highlighted Excerpts</p><p><em>The transcript has been edited for clarity.</em></p><p>What if anything did you take away from the OceanGate situation?</p><p><strong>Jane: </strong>What’s fascinating is we got almost no customer questions or refund requests due to the OceanGate accident. It’s incredibly different from what we do. Also, in the 60+ years of deep ocean submersible operations there had never been a fatal accident until that incident. You have to ask why. I don’t want to focus on OceanGate specifically, but the big takeaway for us was that we embrace regulatory oversight. We want the FAA and Coast Guard to work with us since we also operate at sea. We go so far beyond any standards they would set that it’s good for us and the industry to have that accountability and transparency. That was the main takeaway: We welcome reasonable regulations and oversight.</p><p>Space tourism more akin to safaris than Virgin Galactic</p><p><strong>Jane: </strong>It’s interesting that you talk about Blue Origin and Virgin not being competition because the experience is so differentiated from what we offer. Our experience is more akin to incredible safaris, trips to Antarctica, and other wonder travel that deeply transforms people. That’s why we priced our tickets at $125,000. It’s in line with those kinds of life-changing experiences. When Antarctica tourism opened up, there was a huge demand from people willing to pay high prices for a once-in-a-lifetime trip. We’re seeing incredible excitement and demand from customers wanting to go to space with us. We have an event coming up soon with over 100 of our explorers gathering here, and they all want to connect with each other too. We’re building a real community around spaceflight and this experience. It’s going to be such an extraordinary, bonding experience for people. I truly believe it will bring people together in a deep way.</p><p>You mentioned Blue Origin, Virgin, and SpaceX — obviously some of the first names people think of when space is mentioned like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. They are controversial figures, likely quite different from our target customer base. But I'm curious. What do you think about them? Are you grateful for how they've helped popularize and mainstream space travel?</p><p><strong>Jane:</strong> Taber and I worked with Elon before he started SpaceX, so we have an interesting perspective. In the early days of SpaceX, space tourism was considered a joke and the idea that commercial companies could enable space travel or moon/Mars missions was insane. It was assumed that only governments could do that. Elon deserves a lot of credit; Gwynne Shotwell too. She's done an incredible job revolutionizing the space industry by lowering costs, improving efficiency and effectiveness, and showing us what's possible. SpaceX paved the way for the over 100 small rocket companies operating now, which never would have happened without that trailblazing. So while there are likely narrative or cultural elements we wouldn't fully align with, overall we are absolutely grateful for the pivotal role SpaceX played in advancing commercial space and making it seem achievable.</p><p>What excites you about exploring space?</p><p><strong>Jane:</strong> When I think about space exploration, I don’t view it as leaving Earth never to return. I actually quite like this planet! To me, space exploration is more of an extension of the perspective-broadening we do now. When people look down on Planet Earth from space, it’s a mind-blowing experience. Now imagine yourself standing on the moon or Mars and seeing Earth. It’s that exponentially more impactful. It will give people a wildly different perspective on what it means for all of us to live together. We should think of ourselves as one human family living on Spaceship Earth. As we venture farther out, it will become increasingly clear that we’re holding up a mirror to humanity, seeing ourselves somewhere other than Earth for the first time. It’s a wild concept. So that’s how I view space, not as leaving the planet but expanding our perspective to appreciate that we’re all in this together.</p><p>How do you prevent accidents in the air?</p><p><strong>Jane: </strong>A common question we get is what happens if something goes wrong with the balloon? The balloon technology is incredibly well understood with a long legacy. Hundreds have been flown in the last 20 years without a single in-flight incident. However, we obviously need backup systems. We have a series of parachutes, similar to those used on SpaceX’s Dragon capsules or other space vehicles. They are robust, proven parachutes. We have four total, with only two needed for a safe landing. The parachutes are only used in an emergency scenario because normally the ship ascends under the balloon and descends back onto the balloon, keeping the flight system consistent. This is a very safe approach, never transitioning between flight systems. We’ve focused on simplicity everywhere possible because simpler systems tend to be safer overall.</p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<title><![CDATA[Spaceman Explains to Earthman How Things Work (with Delian Asparouhov)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Last time I remember writing about Varda co-founder and Founders Fund partner <strong>Delian Asparouhov</strong>, I was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/founders-fund-duo-outmatched-by-sf">giving him a hard time</a> about his subdued impromptu Clubhouse run-in with then San Francisco District Attorney <strong>Chesa Boudin</strong> who he’d been flaming on Twitter.</p><p>But since then, Asparouhov has mellowed out online. When I texted him after our podcast recording session and mentioned that his Founders Fund colleague <strong>Mike Solana</strong> was <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1691205229793153025?s=20">sassing me</a> on <strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> social networking platform, Asparouhov wrote back, “Bro I’m tryna do 3 jobs over here. I don’t have time to pay attention to what Solana is up to.”</p><p>Besides Varda and Founders Fund, I wondered what the third job was.</p><p>He texted me back, “Fatherhood.”</p><p>On the latest episode of the <em>Newcomer</em> podcast Asparouhov and I covered a lot of ground. We talked about Varda’s satellite mission and its ambitions to manufacture in space.

So I’d say none of our models or thinking depends on future cost drops. Obviously I’d be thrilled if something like Starship came online, though I think that’ll take time. I’d be excited for more players to start landing rockets - no one has really done that yet, even though it’s been eight and a half years since SpaceX’s first landing. So I’m not counting on it happening soon. We’ve architected our business so it doesn’t depend on further cost reductions.</p><p>.</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Last time I remember writing about Varda co-founder and Founders Fund partner &lt;strong&gt;Delian Asparouhov&lt;/strong&gt;, I was &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/founders-fund-duo-outmatched-by-sf&quot;&gt;giving him a hard time&lt;/a&gt; about his subdued impromptu Clubhouse run-in with then San Francisco District Attorney &lt;strong&gt;Chesa Boudin&lt;/strong&gt; who he’d been flaming on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since then, Asparouhov has mellowed out online. When I texted him after our podcast recording session and mentioned that his Founders Fund colleague &lt;strong&gt;Mike Solana&lt;/strong&gt; was &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1691205229793153025?s=20&quot;&gt;sassing me&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk’s&lt;/strong&gt; social networking platform, Asparouhov wrote back, “Bro I’m tryna do 3 jobs over here. I don’t have time to pay attention to what Solana is up to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Varda and Founders Fund, I wondered what the third job was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He texted me back, “Fatherhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the latest episode of the &lt;em&gt;Newcomer&lt;/em&gt; podcast Asparouhov and I covered a lot of ground. We talked about Varda’s satellite mission and its ambitions to manufacture in space. We discussed SpaceX’s reusable rocket and the media &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/science/spacex-launch-explosion-elon-musk.html&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; around Starship’s explosion.

			<title><![CDATA[Scaling People (with Claire Hughes Johnson)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Claire Hughes Johnson </strong>writes in her book, <a target="_blank" href="https://press.stripe.com/scaling-people"><em>Scaling People</em></a><em>, </em>about a moment early on in her time at Stripe when an Irish journalist shouted to her, “You’re the lady! You’re the lady with the lads!”</p><p>Hughes Johnson, who joined Stripe in 2014 as the payments startup’s chief operating officer, works closely with two of the most iconic Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, <strong>Patrick and John Collison</strong>. During her tenure as COO, she helped bring her management know-how from Google and experience working for <strong>Sheryl Sandberg</strong> to help organize the growing company. </p><p>I invited Hughes Johnson on the <em>Newcomer </em>podcast to talk about her time at Stripe and the management lessons that she has put down on paper in <em>Scaling People</em>, which she published this year. Toward the end of our conversation, Hughes Johnson turned the tables on me and gave me some coaching.</p><p>Our conversation circles around two sections of her book, in particular. We talked about giving feedback and honesty in a corporate setting. She talked about her principle that managers should encourage people to “say the thing you cannot say.”</p><p>She writes,</p><p>How often have you sat in a meeting and mused, “It really feels like there’s something that isn’t being talked about right now”? Or had a conversation with a report and thought, “I think they’re getting upset about what I’m saying”? Or caught yourself filtering everything you say? These questions prompt a bigger one: Why don’t managers say what’s actually on their minds?</p><p>People often think that good management is about having a lot of filters, and for good reason. There’s a lot that might feel risky to say, or that feels like a personal judgment. But be wary of over-filtering. Fine-tuning your filters and pushing yourself to name your observation in a constructive way means you’ll be able to have a more honest conversation about what’s going on. Then you can all start working on a solution in earnest.</p><p>Hughes Johnson concludes scaling people with a chapter titled, “You.” It looks at how managers manage themselves.</p><p>She writes,</p><p>The more senior you become, the more creative reality gets at finding ways to beat you up every day. You will have days—sometimes many in a row—when your highest performer is threatening to quit, a top customer has just informed you that they’re moving to a competitor, you’re leading a company-wide meeting the next day and haven’t had time to prepare, and the cross-functional project you kicked off last week is already going off the rails. Many people don’t have the psychological strength and resilience to keep going. In <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em>, Ben Horowitz calls this “the struggle,” when “nothing is easy and nothing feels right.”</p><p>To make it all work, you have to learn how to manage your time and energy. First, diagnose what gives and takes your energy. The easiest way to do this is to map out your good and bad days and track what activities add to and detract from your energy. An easy tactic is to keep check marks on your calendar of good days and bad days. After a month, look at all the good days and all the bad days, and then the good weeks and bad weeks, and see what trends jump out. When I did this exercise, I found that the weeks when I had more than one work event that kept me from having dinner with my kids and getting them to bed were bad weeks. I then resolved to restrict my work-related late nights to once a week—a personal guideline that I occasionally break, but not often. Your goal is to study what combination of time spent on which activities creates your best performance, then determine where you need to set boundaries to preserve your strongest self.</p><p>Coming up as a reporter, I was always resistant to “management” and “leadership” advice. Those words made me think of Dale Carnegie books and cash-grab leadership seminars. But as I’ve started to build <em>Newcomer </em>into more of a company (we’ve got a full-time chief of staff, three summer interns, and am <a target="_blank" href="https://newcomer.notion.site/Reporter-70-000-90-000-full-time-remote-3356c5010cd64190aad1c0ce0f689c4e">looking to hire a full-time reporter</a>), I’ve come around to the idea that being intentional about how you spend your time and how you work with people are essential skills, worthy of serious reflection. </p><p>These days, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claire-hughes-johnson-7058/">Hughes Johnson</a> is a corporate officer and advisor at Stripe. She’s spending a lot of her time working with individual managers and offering coaching inside the company. So we got a taste of how Stripe’s management guru thinks.</p><p>I really enjoyed our conversation. Give it a listen. </p><p>Highlighted Excerpts</p><p><em>The transcript has been edited for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>On Good Management.</strong></p><p><strong>Claire Hughes Johnson:</strong> One of the topics that came to mind during my interview with John and Patrick was the importance of good management and smart operating structures. I emphasized that we shouldn’t be reinventing the wheel. I believe in fundamentally sound management practices, rather than creating an entirely new way of thinking about performance feedback.</p><p>I paused and told them, “You guys have to be with me on this. We might start with a very basic version of performance feedback, but it’s better to do that than to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” What’s wrong with doing everything from first principles? At some point, it becomes exhausting, and you might not be the best at constructing the system.</p><p>I also discussed the permanence of management structures and hierarchies that have been in place for hundreds of years. There have been attempts to innovate, such as holacracy, and workers’ expectations have changed. I’m not suggesting we do things the same way we did 100 years ago, but we must pay attention to history.</p><p>Patrick became particularly interested in this topic and started reading studies on management practices. He found academic research and data that showed countries with good management education and practices tend to have better economic outcomes. He agreed, saying, “Yeah, I think you’re right. Let’s put some fundamentals in place.”</p><p>Unfortunately, some young companies want to reinvent more than they should. They may have invented a great product and feel compelled to create new ways to manage people. But I believe this can be a mistake, and it’s better to rely on proven methods and structures.</p><p><strong>Young companies, especially, should practice giving feedback.</strong></p><p><strong>Claire Hughes Johnson:</strong> The book has a lot of stuff on operating structures. It’s really important to have goals and metrics that everyone recognizes as the company's most important goals, and to review them publicly with everyone. The mission should be clearly articulated, along with the direction for the next three to five years. Clear feedback structures are vital. Ideally, feedback should be continuous, but in young companies, many managers are new to this process, so they’re not giving as much feedback. Therefore, you actually have to build more structures for it, which may seem counterintuitive. Some companies might say, “Oh, we’re just running after this prize, and we can’t be distracted by that.” But I respond, “Well, actually, it’s the most important thing, because you aren’t used to doing it.”</p><p><strong>How do you think about feedback? How direct or brutal should the feedback be?</strong></p><p><strong>Claire Hughes Johnson:</strong> When I first started working at Google, I was shocked at how direct the engineers were, saying things like, “That’s a terrible idea.” It was not the world I had been in working in consulting or government. At first, I got defensive, but I’ve come to love it. </p><p>However, when I talk about feedback, there’s a level of directness that I don’t think is productive. If it’s so direct that it feels like an attack, people stop listening and think about survival. It becomes a matter of adapting or dying.</p><p>I have an operating principle that I talk about in the book: “Say the thing you think you cannot say.” I try to push myself and others to be open and willing to put things on the table without creating an attack response. For example, I might say to a leadership team member at Stripe, “From my seat, 10,000-20,000 feet away, I have a couple of things I’m worried about.” Then we can have an interesting conversation, looking at the problem together.</p><p>As a leader, it’s also about reading the room, even virtually. What’s the body language? Are people making eye contact? Are there weird comments in the doc? My job is to get everyone else’s opinion on the table first. Sometimes I'll say, “It feels like there's something we’re not saying. It feels tense in here.” Then I might call on someone to break through to the real thing.</p><p>There are different dynamics at play, such as power dynamics and layering issues. Sometimes you can tell the team isn’t behind their leader. Other times, there’s friction within the team or with another team. And sometimes, it's a matter of seeing the forest for the trees, stepping back to look at the bigger picture. Is this actually a good product? Why are we not seeing more user adoption? Why have we only grown 10% when the rest of the products are growing 40%? As a leader, your job is to have that bigger picture in mind and to ask, “Is this the right strategy?” Sometimes, you have to zoom out and say, “We’re having the wrong conversation, folks.”</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

We might start with a very basic version of performance feedback, but it’s better to do that than to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” What’s wrong with doing everything from first principles? At some point, it becomes exhausting, and you might not be the best at constructing the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also discussed the permanence of management structures and hierarchies that have been in place for hundreds of years. There have been attempts to innovate, such as holacracy, and workers’ expectations have changed. I’m not suggesting we do things the same way we did 100 years ago, but we must pay attention to history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick became particularly interested in this topic and started reading studies on management practices. He found academic research and data that showed countries with good management education and practices tend to have better economic outcomes. He agreed, saying, “Yeah, I think you’re right. Let’s put some fundamentals in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some young companies want to reinvent more than they should. They may have invented a great product and feel compelled to create new ways to manage people. But I believe this can be a mistake, and it’s better to rely on proven methods and structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young companies, especially, should practice giving feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claire Hughes Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; The book has a lot of stuff on operating structures. It’s really important to have goals and metrics that everyone recognizes as the company&apos;s most important goals, and to review them publicly with everyone. The mission should be clearly articulated, along with the direction for the next three to five years. Clear feedback structures are vital. Ideally, feedback should be continuous, but in young companies, many managers are new to this process, so they’re not giving as much feedback. Therefore, you actually have to build more structures for it, which may seem counterintuitive. Some companies might say, “Oh, we’re just running after this prize, and we can’t be distracted by that.” But I respond, “Well, actually, it’s the most important thing, because you aren’t used to doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think about feedback? How direct or brutal should the feedback be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claire Hughes Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; When I first started working at Google, I was shocked at how direct the engineers were, saying things like, “That’s a terrible idea.” It was not the world I had been in working in consulting or government. At first, I got defensive, but I’ve come to love it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I talk about feedback, there’s a level of directness that I don’t think is productive. If it’s so direct that it feels like an attack, people stop listening and think about survival. It becomes a matter of adapting or dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an operating principle that I talk about in the book: “Say the thing you think you cannot say.” I try to push myself and others to be open and willing to put things on the table without creating an attack response. For example, I might say to a leadership team member at Stripe, “From my seat, 10,000-20,000 feet away, I have a couple of things I’m worried about.” Then we can have an interesting conversation, looking at the problem together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a leader, it’s also about reading the room, even virtually. What’s the body language? Are people making eye contact? Are there weird comments in the doc? My job is to get everyone else’s opinion on the table first. Sometimes I&apos;ll say, “It feels like there&apos;s something we’re not saying. It feels tense in here.” Then I might call on someone to break through to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different dynamics at play, such as power dynamics and layering issues. Sometimes you can tell the team isn’t behind their leader. Other times, there’s friction within the team or with another team. And sometimes, it&apos;s a matter of seeing the forest for the trees, stepping back to look at the bigger picture. Is this actually a good product? Why are we not seeing more user adoption? Why have we only grown 10% when the rest of the products are growing 40%? As a leader, your job is to have that bigger picture in mind and to ask, “Is this the right strategy?” Sometimes, you have to zoom out and say, “We’re having the wrong conversation, folks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Psychedelics, Micro Nuclear Reactors & Venture Turbulence (with Rebecca Kaden)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Union Square Ventures has some of the best performing funds in the venture capital industry. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/venture-capital-returns-ziplines">As I’ve reported</a>, USV-backer UTIMCO disclosed in a recent filing that USV had delivered the public investment fund an internal rate of return of 59%. And that number will likely go up over time. (For instance, USV portfolio company Casetext <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/650-million-for-casetext-and-13-billion">sold to Thomson Reuters</a> for $650 million after the UTIMCO performance update.) </p><p>I invited USV managing partner <strong>Rebecca Kaden </strong>onto the <em>Newcomer</em> podcast to talk about how USV consistently invests in unconventional companies. </p><p>We started off our conversation talking about Journey Clinical, the psychedelics company, in which Kaden <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2023/01/journey-clinicals-series-a/">announced</a> a Series A investment in January. </p><p>We also discussed USV’s $200 million climate fund strategy, her interest in the AI application layer, and how rising interest rates are effecting the venture capital asset class. </p><p>Give it a listen</p><p>Highlighted Excerpts</p><p><em>The transcript has been edited for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Eric: </strong><strong><em>How do you repeatedly invest in weird things like psychedelics?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> This thesis around access to care, which has attracted so much capital — some of it ours and is proving to be a good category — has been where the market has gone, but it’s actually only one piece of the puzzle. The way we get into things that are unusual is by having strong theses about where things are going versus being extremely opportunistic. Obviously, there’s a balance. But that thesis thinking is important. A lot of thesis work on this category really led to the belief that access to care is only half the puzzle. The other is how is care itself going to evolve, and you start unraveling that thread: how is care itself evolving? The real biggest last evolution of care is SSRIs. Those are prescription drugs and have been very important to the treatment for mental health crises, but there’s a lot of things they don’t treat. They’re not a one size fits all model. And they’re basically all we got, right? The innovation has not had a lot of other layers, except for psychedelics. And so we became very interested in psychedelics as the next card to get turned over and the next option in needing a bucket of options to treat a crisis.</p><p><strong>Eric: </strong><strong><em>There are pharmaceutical companies. If there’s money to be made, shouldn’t they be trying? What’s happening that it feels like you need a real outsider thinking to bring ketamine, a drug that’s legal, to people’s lives that the medical system is unable or unwilling to do what’s happening?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: Well, this isn’t really unique to psychedelics or to mental health. Pharmaceutical companies make drugs, so the development of drugs goes with them, but the distribution and networks of access is outside of it. That’s not particularly new or unique here. That’s where business opportunity has been. So the idea is, when you talk about distribution and networks of access, that’s often where these business opportunities lie. The development of drugs is kind of a different beast, which lies in the pharmaceuticals. Why is there a business opportunity with creating access? Because the same reason technology drives business opportunity into anything. Offline access is slower, it’s more gated; it’s more piecemeal. You have to be at the right doctor at the right time, you have to find it. By creating a network, you just allow anyone anywhere to find access and education at a faster speed and with much broader supply, which brings efficiency to the market.</p><p><strong><em>Eric: Do you think mushrooms are going to be on the table soon? Or how much was this a bet that the regulatory regime would change?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I don’t think mushrooms as we think about them in a recreational sense are just gonna get legalized, maybe they will, but that’s a separate kind of thing. I think other forms of psychedelics in formats that are right for care are very much going to get legalized. And actually, as we did our research, to us that’s a <em>when</em> not an <em>if</em>. When you dig into what’s going on clinical trials and in the clinical world, in some ways that seems pretty easy to bet on that these will continue to happen. And if not exactly the form that we’ve outlined, rapid new forms of options for care for mental health diseases are going to get approved and released. They’re going to need a network of education and distribution to go into the therapist network.</p><p>I do think there’s a regulatory risk here. There’s some amount of regulatory risk on psychedelics. We have to be honest about it. But I actually think more about regulatory risk across broader online healthcare in general. We’re at somewhat of a time of that whole market still getting worked out on not unique to mental health and not unique to psychedelics, but what you can prescribe online and to whom and to how and how to allow that really important access that we’ve come to rely on, but also do it in an appropriately controlled way.</p><p><strong>Eric: </strong><strong><em>You come from a consumer focused firm. When you were interviewing with USV, was it clear that you were shifting away from consumer, and how have you thought about consumer professionally?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> We don’t think a lot about the divide in our portfolio if we think about our fund construction, or how we're looking at the world between consumer and B2B. What we think about is this thesis and the mechanics involved, for instance the role of building network driven businesses and the opportunity to leverage bottom up networks to create moats and scale and to broaden access by driving value and down costs systematically across categories we care about. Sometimes the right application when you pull the threads of that thesis is a consumer product or service, and sometimes it’s the enabling infrastructure of them. But most of USV’s investments had been one of those two things. They’ve either been the end application or the enabling infrastructure involved, but a common theme throughout our investments is how do you build important networks that can change industries, but rise outside of them. If you think about Journey Clinical, it’s a network of therapists. They’re stronger, and the more you add on to them, it’s a bottom up growing network of acquiring the therapist, even though it interacts with the healthcare system and can change it. But it’s growing this network outside of the infrastructure to then impact the existing structure. We really like that if you think across of our investments, and sometimes that turns out to be consumer, if you think about an Outschool in education, or a Duolingo, or a Twitter, and sometimes it turns out to be the enabling infrastructure or the B2B Marketplace application like Journey Clinical.</p><p><strong>Eric: </strong><strong><em>What are your thoughts on AI in consumer?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> The piece of the AI craziness that I’m most excited about is the application layer. There’s still a lot of kind of complexity and uncertainty on the foundational model and on the enabling infrastructure on where equity value aggregates — how much of the stack the models own, how defensible those models are, how that shakes out — but what I feel like we can have more conviction about is that it unleashes a wave of consumer innovation that’s going to be really fun. The way this is gonna get utilized is by products that we want to use. I’m excited about unleashing this rejuvenated value around fun things to do, where the coolest thing about AI driven applications is they get better if people actually use them. So the strongest incentive of the team is to increase engagement and utility. The only way to do that is to combine utility with fun. There’s gonna be so many things in the market that if things aren’t fun to use, you’ll go to another option. But the team has a huge incentive to get you to stick because that’s how their product gets better. So if you think about something like Duolingo, which has been on this for a long time of leveraging machine learning and AI to create better consumer experiences — streaks, gamification, fun — infused with the utility of language learning is critical, because their product gets better if I use it. I’m really excited to see that apply to lots of different consumer applications. We’ve been talking a lot and everyone’s been talking a lot about whether they’re going to be moats. Is stickiness going to be possible? The barriers are so low. The moat is going to be fun and teams that can create rapid new fun things that keep you on the platform. We haven’t seen that in a while. I’m excited about it.</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

So the strongest incentive of the team is to increase engagement and utility. The only way to do that is to combine utility with fun. There’s gonna be so many things in the market that if things aren’t fun to use, you’ll go to another option. But the team has a huge incentive to get you to stick because that’s how their product gets better. So if you think about something like Duolingo, which has been on this for a long time of leveraging machine learning and AI to create better consumer experiences — streaks, gamification, fun — infused with the utility of language learning is critical, because their product gets better if I use it. I’m really excited to see that apply to lots of different consumer applications. We’ve been talking a lot and everyone’s been talking a lot about whether they’re going to be moats. Is stickiness going to be possible? The barriers are so low. The moat is going to be fun and teams that can create rapid new fun things that keep you on the platform. We haven’t seen that in a while. I’m excited about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Talking Threads With the Facebook Whistleblower Frances Haugen]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> is the liberal elite’s enemy of the moment. </p><p>How quickly the bad blood for <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> is forgotten. </p><p>When<strong> </strong>Zuckerberg’s Meta released Twitter rival Threads, reporters and left-leaning types (myself included) flocked to the new app as a potential refuge from Musk’s Twitter. </p><p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend seemed to be the logic of the moment.</p><p>I invited Facebook whistleblower <strong>Frances Haugen</strong> onto the podcast to discuss the sudden embrace of Threads, her ongoing criticisms of how Facebook operates, and her new book, <em>The Power of One.</em></p><p>Haugen, for one, has not forgotten the problems with Facebook. She hadn’t downloaded Threads.</p><p>I said on the podcast, “As a reporter, it’s funny to see the reporter class embracing Threads at the moment when two years ago, or even more than that, they would have been so negative and apprehensive about trusting Facebook. I’m just curious watching the pretty upbeat response to Threads, what do you take from that and are you surprised there seems to be some media trust for Facebook right now.”</p><p>Haugen was empathetic toward people fleeing Twitter for Threads. </p><p>“I think it’s one of these things where the trauma the Twitter community has faced in the last year is pretty intense,” Haugen told me. “People really liked having a space to discuss ideas, to discuss issues, and the idea that they could have a space again feels really good.”</p><p>We spent much of the episode getting into the particulars of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook Files</a> and her criticisms of Facebook. </p><p>She outlines a core critique in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-One-Strength-Whistle-Facebook/dp/031647522X"><em>The Power of One’s</em></a> introduction:</p><p>One of the questions I was often asked after I went public was, “Why are there so few whistleblowers at other technology companies, like, say, Apple?” My answer: Apple lacks the incentive or the ability to lie to the public about the most meaningful dimensions of their business. For physical products like an Apple phone or laptop, anyone can examine the physical inputs (like metals or other natural resources) and ask where they came from and the conditions of their mining, or monitor the physical products and pollution generated to understand societal harms the company is externalizing. Scientists can place sensors outside an Apple factory and monitor the pollutants that may vent into the sky or flow into rivers and oceans. People can and do take apart Apple products within hours of their release and publish YouTube videos confirming the benchmarks Apple has promoted, or verify that the parts Apple claims are in there, are in fact there. Apple knows that if they lie to the public, they will be caught, and quickly. </p><p>Facebook, on the other hand, provided a social network that presented a different product to every user in the world. We— and by we, I mean parents, children, voters, legislators, businesses, consumers, terrorists, sex- traffickers, everyone— were limited by our own individual experiences in trying to assess What is Facebook, exactly? We had no way to tell how representative, how widespread or not, the user experience and harms each of us encountered was. As a result, it didn’t matter if activists came forward and reported Facebook was enabling child exploitation, terrorist recruiting, a neo-Nazi movement, and ethnic violence designed and executed to be broadcast on social media, or unleashing algorithms that created eating disorders or motivated suicides. Facebook would just deflect with versions of the same talking point: “What you are seeing is anecdotal, an anomaly. The problem you found is not representative of what Facebook is.”</p><p>To jog your memory for the episode, in September 2021, the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>published the first in a series of articles, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">called the </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"><em>Facebook Files</em></a>, about the company’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=article_inline">cross check program</a>, which gave special treatment to high-profile users when it came to the company’s moderation decisions. </p><p><em>The Journal</em> followed that report with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">a story about how Facebook’s internal research</a> showed that 32% of teen girls said “that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline">The third story</a> in the series showed that Facebook’s decision to preference “meaningful social interactions” seemed to have the opposite effect, giving more reach to posts that instigated conflict and anger. </p><p>Perhaps most damning in my mind, was the <em>Journal’s </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline">fourth story in the series</a> which showed that Facebook had failed to implement internationally many of the table stakes moderation practices it applies in the U.S.</p><p><em>The Journal </em><a target="_blank" href="https://liu.edu/polk-awards/past-winners#2021">won</a> a Polk Award for its reporting. </p><p>I have at times been skeptical of how damning these stories were. </p><p>It’s not that crazy to me that Facebook would want to provide extra attention toward moderation decisions for public figures. </p><p>Is Instagram harming teen girls more than Vogue or Cosmo? </p><p>So it was fun to finally hash out some of these issues with Haugen on the podcast. </p><p>Ultimately, I think we were mostly aligned that we both support much better disclosure requirements for Facebook. Regulators are fighting with both arms tied behind their backs.</p><p>I was disappointed, however, that Haugen seemed to bend over backward to come off as apolitical in her critique of Facebook. She didn’t really engage in the obvious political asymmetry: Republicans are clearly much more likely to post the type of content that Democrats would call misinformation. </p><p>I think that’s a fair statement whatever you think of “misinformation.”</p><p>Anyway, that should give you enough context to dig into our conversation. Enjoy!</p><p>Give it a listen</p><p>Highlighted Excerpts</p><p><em>The transcript has been edited for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Eric: </strong>How would you see a disclosure regime working that still allows companies like Facebook to be flexible and to change?</p><p><strong>Frances:</strong> I think a lot of people don’t sit and think about what’s the menu of options when it comes to intervening in a problem as complicated as this. I’m really glad that you brought up the idea that these companies’ grow and change, where the next one to come along might not fit the exact same mold of this one. One of the ways the European Union handles that flexibility — and to be really clear, this kind of way of doing regulation of saying disclosure and transparency is instead of something like what’s happening what’s happening in Utah, where Utah is coming in and saying, “This is how you will run your company.” If people are under 18, they have to have parent supervision, no privacy for kids, their parents can see everything — or like Montana coming out and just flat out banning TikTok. Those are kind of “building fences” type roles, where we’re like, “Oh, this is the fence you can’t cross.” And the thing about technology is it moves and changes, and they’re very good at running around fences.</p><p>So the alternative is something like what the European Union passed last year, which is called the Digital Services Act. And the Digital Services Act says, “Hey, if the core problem is a power imbalance, right, the fact that you can know what’s going on and I can’t, let’s address that core problem because a lot of other things will flow downstream from it.” So they say, “Hey, if you know there’s a risk with your product, you need to tell us about it. If you discover one, if you can imagine one and you tell us about it. You need to tell us your plan for mitigating it because it’s going to be different for every platform. We want it to unleash innovation. And you need to give us enough data that we can see that there was progress being made to meet that goal. And if we ask you a question, we deserve to get an answer,” which sounds really basic, but it’s not true today.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> Some of these problems that you've identified are just human problems. If you talk about sort of the Instagram critique with it, potentially making sort of young teenage women — some segment of them unhappy. I mean, you could say, like, was that so different from Vogue? Is this really an algorithmic problem?</p><p><strong>Haugen:</strong> There have always been teen girls that were unhappy about their bodies or how nice their clothes wer<strong>e. </strong>But there are a limited number of pages of Vogue every month. The second time you read Vogue, you’re going to have a different impact on you than the third time you read Vogue. Or you’re going to get bored of it? And in the case of something like Instagram, Instagram progressively pushes you towards more and more extreme content.</p><p>…</p><p>With a 13-year-old girl, she might start out by looking for something like healthy recipes. And just by clicking on the content get pushed over time towards more and more extreme materials.</p><p><strong>Eric: </strong>Why did you decide to come out and reveal your identity?</p><p><strong>Frances:</strong> I had been contemplating for quite a while would I have to come forward at some point. I had a chance to talk to my parents about it a large number of times just because what I was seeing on a day-to-day basis while I lived with them during COVID was so different from Facebook’s public narrative was on these issues. But the moment where I was like “okay, I have no other options” was right after the 2020 election — so this was in December, less than 30 days after the election — they pulled us all together on Zoom and said, <em>You know how for the last four years, the only part of Facebook that was growing was the Civic Integrity team.</em> So it was the team, for Facebook.com aimed to ensure Facebook was a positive social force in the world, that it wasn’t going to disrupt elections, it wasn’t going to cause any more genocides because by that point there had been two. They said, <em>Hey,</em> <em>you are so important; we’re going to dissolve your team and integrate it into the rest of Facebook.</em> </p><p>And when they did that, that was kind of the moment where I realized Facebook had given up. That the only way that Facebook was going to save itself was if the public got involved. That the public had to come and save Facebook. </p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<title><![CDATA[Musk & Zuck Go Head to Head, Vying to Rule Global Online Discussion (with Katie Notopoulos & Tom Dotan)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Former BuzzFeed reporter <strong>Katie Notopoulos</strong> spent the first few days posting on Meta’s Twitter copycat, Threads, as if she were the editor-in-chief of the new app. </p><p>“As EIC, it’s a lot of work! I’m personally curating the feed for users based on all of Meta’s information on them to bring each person a hand-curated feed that I’ve approved,” Notopoulos posted on Threads. </p><p>While Meta tolerated the ruse, the company censored one of her more roguish posts. </p><p>“At Threads, our expectation is for all users to treat others with kindness and respect. This encompasses acknowledging the choice to adopt a Nazi lifestyle. We embrace a diverse community,” she trolled.</p><p>Ultimately, Notopoulos announced that she had been fired from her role as editor-in-chief. </p><p>I invited her on the show, along with <em>Dead Cat</em> podcast defector <strong>Tom Dotan</strong>, who abandoned our old podcast in favor of a gig at the <em>Wall Street Journal. </em>Together, we made sense of the Threads-Twitter rivalry. We talked on Friday so a few of our stats on Threads’ growth might be outdated. Threads has since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/10/meta-twitter-threads-100-million-users">exceeded</a> 100 million users and <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.complex.com/life/a/tracewilliamcowen/elon-musk-penis-measuring-contest-mark-zuckerberg-threads">proposed</a> a “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/someone-please-stop-the-musk-vs-zuck-dick-measuring-contest-2023-7">literal dick measuring contest</a>” and called Zuckerberg a “<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1678098028849143809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1678222776908275712%7Ctwgr%5E73d2713d373562794faad893249f0f075a54e624%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&#38;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fsomeone-please-stop-the-musk-vs-zuck-dick-measuring-contest-2023-7">cuck</a>.” Otherwise, I think you’ll find our conversation perfectly current. </p><p>It’s a lively episode. I posit that Threads will quickly become the Uber to Twitter’s Lyft. </p><p>I didn’t just invite Notopoulos on the show because she has been a Threads troll and a the thorn in the side of Meta.

Do you think the personality and positioning of Facebook will play a significant role, or is it all about the product and Instagram’s connection?</p><p><strong>Katie</strong>: It’s a combination. Threads’ success will come from being a product under Instagram, which many people don’t realize is owned by Facebook. On the other hand, people are leaving Twitter because of Elon Musk's presence.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>: Facebook has a history of copying features in response to perceived threats, such as stories. However, Twitter isn’t a threat. This opportunistic move by Facebook. To launch Threads won’t magically fix the limitations of text-based platforms. We’re in an era of niche social media experiences, and reaching a billion users with this format is unlikely. It’s unfair to hold that expectation. Nonetheless, with 70 million users already, it can be considered a success.</p><p><strong>Katie:</strong> The Instagram account provided a dictionary where a conversation is referred to as a thread. For example, I was reading some intriguing threads that Eric was discussing. However, an individual post is still called a post, and instead of a retweet, it’s called a repost.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> What are your thoughts on what was happening there? I found it very strange that they were dictating the language they want people to use. I couldn't determine if they're worried people will start using terms like “tweet” and if they wanted to discourage that.</p><p><strong>Katie:</strong> I interpreted it similarly. People were genuinely asking, you know, what should we call them? Since they're not tweets, do we call them retweets? What should we call them? I think the worst-case scenario would be if people started jokingly referring to them as “threats,” which is probably not what they intended.</p><p><strong>Eric: </strong>People are really enjoying wordplay, and personally, I'm not a fan of that. There are posts about your followers or your thread count. It's like a new summer camp where everyone is trying to come up with the language that will dominate the platform.</p><p><strong>Katie:</strong> Absolutely. And it’s important to remember that there are a lot more people signing up than they expected, maybe around 70 million or something. But most of these users aren’t on Twitter and don't know anything about it. They’re not comparing it to Twitter. It’s mostly regular users, like 16-year-olds in Brazil, who are thinking, “Oh, a new platform? Where does this fit in with Instagram? Just tell me what to do.” The user base is incredibly diverse, which is why it's very straightforward in terms of understanding.</p><p><strong>Tom:</strong> Explain to me, though, why people who have never liked Twitter would suddenly join a Twitter copycat and find it useful. Twitter has been around for a while, and its mechanics and design haven't broadly appealed to more than 200-300 million users. So why now are they expecting people in Brazil, who have ignored Twitter for the first decade of its existence, to suddenly find “thread” compelling just because they can use their Instagram handle and easily sign up?</p><p><strong>Katie: </strong>Personally, as someone eager to test out new apps, I preordered it on iTunes so that it would be ready for download at exactly 7 pm. I was excited about it because I follow technology news and knew there was a new app coming out. But for most people, I don’t think they heard about the app and actively went to the App Store to look for it. I assume that when most people opened Instagram, they received a prompt to click and experience the new threads. They were signed up right from inside the Instagram app. So, anyone who opened Instagram yesterday was directed to join the app. They might have thought, “I’m not sure what this is, but I like Instagram, so I’ll give it a try.”</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> It seems like there are a couple of factors at play. There’s definitely a disdain for Elon Musk, particularly among reporters and the left, including myself. I feel like that revolt and the desire of that crowd to find a new home helped motivate this, which is amusing because those same individuals have been critical of Zuck over the past five years.</p><p><strong>Katie: </strong>I think it’s a case of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” to a large extent. That seems to be the prevailing sentiment.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> Indeed. It’s obviously Instagram's power to bring Instagram users to the new app. Additionally, there are people who believe in getting on a platform early and building followers. So it’s like these three groups trying to coexist—the social media managers who want to grow their accounts in case it becomes the next big thing, the Twitter rebels, and the Instagram influencers who are being told that this is part of the app.</p><p><strong>Katie: </strong>I have another theory as well. When you sign up for the app, the feed is currently purely algorithmic, and it includes a lot of content from people you don't follow. There’s probably a lot of enthusiasm from these big celebrities who haven’t found success on TikTok and are holding onto Instagram as an essential platform for their careers. Fans and regular users are excited because they suddenly see celebrities who hadn't posted on Twitter for years.</p><p><strong>Eric</strong>: What are people’s opinions on the algorithmic feed? I think the average person wants an algorithmic feed.</p><p><strong>Katie</strong>: I believe so too. Instagram has continued to have an algorithmic feed for years because multiple tests have shown that it's what people actually want.</p><p><strong>Katie</strong>: Another important factor to consider is the timing of the app’s launch. Summer is the ideal season for such apps because teenagers are out of school and have more time to use their phones. The current success can be attributed to the high number of young users who are typically in school during other times of the year. While the app’s popularity may decline in the fall, I don't think it will fade away like Clubhouse did.</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>: Additionally, Facebook can easily maintain the app without much effort. Even if it reaches its peak user base, let’s say around 100 million, and then gradually declines to 50 or 60 million, it will still be manageable for Facebook to sustain it. The operating costs are likely low, mainly cloud computing expenses, and it might even serve as an ad platform. For Facebook, it could be a side project that requires minimal effort. If it also happens to cause some inconvenience for Elon Musk and the ongoing competition in Silicon Valley, then that's an added bonus.</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Former BuzzFeed reporter &lt;strong&gt;Katie Notopoulos&lt;/strong&gt; spent the first few days posting on Meta’s Twitter copycat, Threads, as if she were the editor-in-chief of the new app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As EIC, it’s a lot of work! I’m personally curating the feed for users based on all of Meta’s information on them to bring each person a hand-curated feed that I’ve approved,” Notopoulos posted on Threads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Meta tolerated the ruse, the company censored one of her more roguish posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At Threads, our expectation is for all users to treat others with kindness and respect. This encompasses acknowledging the choice to adopt a Nazi lifestyle. We embrace a diverse community,” she trolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Notopoulos announced that she had been fired from her role as editor-in-chief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I invited her on the show, along with &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt; podcast defector &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan&lt;/strong&gt;, who abandoned our old podcast in favor of a gig at the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;Together, we made sense of the Threads-Twitter rivalry. We talked on Friday so a few of our stats on Threads’ growth might be outdated. Threads has since &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/07/10/meta-twitter-threads-100-million-users&quot;&gt;exceeded&lt;/a&gt; 100 million users and &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.complex.com/life/a/tracewilliamcowen/elon-musk-penis-measuring-contest-mark-zuckerberg-threads&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; a “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/someone-please-stop-the-musk-vs-zuck-dick-measuring-contest-2023-7&quot;&gt;literal dick measuring contest&lt;/a&gt;” and called Zuckerberg a “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1678098028849143809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1678222776908275712%7Ctwgr%5E73d2713d373562794faad893249f0f075a54e624%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;#38;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fsomeone-please-stop-the-musk-vs-zuck-dick-measuring-contest-2023-7&quot;&gt;cuck&lt;/a&gt;.” Otherwise, I think you’ll find our conversation perfectly current. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lively episode. I posit that Threads will quickly become the Uber to Twitter’s Lyft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t just invite Notopoulos on the show because she has been a Threads troll and a the thorn in the side of Meta. She is famous for her extremely online, yet carefully reported pieces from her time at BuzzFeed. She &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/chuck-e-cheese-animatronic-floppy-disks&quot;&gt;wrote a piece&lt;/a&gt; titled, “Chuck E. Cheese Still Uses Floppy Disks To Make Its Rodent Mascot Dance — For Now.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;And she &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/bored-ape-nft-founder-identity&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the real names of the Bored Apes founders. BuzzFeed is paying her for the next few months after the company shut down its news division. So she’s had plenty of time to spend on Threads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotan once covered Snapchat obsessively and we spent many &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat &lt;/em&gt;episodes talking about Facebook, so I thought this would be a fun episode to have him back on the show — even if the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;has muzzled how wild he can be in his pronouncements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We concluded the show talking about a much more Newcomer-y topic. Dotan &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-boom-stems-techs-downturn-a669b4a3&quot;&gt;wrote last week&lt;/a&gt; about how AI had stemmed tech’s downturn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-boom-stems-techs-downturn-a669b4a3&quot;&gt;He reported&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq has risen 32% this year—the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 3.4%—while Microsoft shares have climbed 41% and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA&quot;&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; shares have almost tripled on the back of optimism that AI will bolster their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that had been touting their cost-cutting and apologizing for hiring too many people in recent years have been adding to the excitement by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://insight.factset.com/highest-number-of-sp-500-companies-citing-ai-on-q1-earnings-calls-in-over-10-years&quot;&gt;broadcasting their AI ambitions&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title><![CDATA[Techstars CEO Maëlle Gavet Talks Pre-Seed Deals, YC, SoftBank & `Zombie Mode' Funds]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maëlle Gavet</strong> and I first crossed paths about a decade ago when she was the CEO of the Russian e-commerce company Ozon. Then, we met up again when she was working as the chief operating officer for the SoftBank-backed real estate tech company Compass. A couple of months ago, I ran into Gavet at a networking dinner in New York City. I interrogated her about her two-and-half years so far as the chief executive officer of Techstars, the global pre-seed investment firm.</p><p>I invited Gavet on the <em>Newcomer </em>podcast to talk about her time at Techstars and the state of the early stage market. You can listen on <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomer/id1582647825">Apple</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/34NxWrRHHAU5uWG5RfnZIP?si=1f11d9417cba422c">Spotify</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@newcomerpod">YouTube</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/substack-reader/id1581650857">Substack’s app</a> or wherever you get your podcasts. I’ve also included some excerpts from the discussion below. </p><p>What she said about the state of venture capital firms will strike a chord of fear with many of my readers. Gavet warned that many VC funds are entering “zombie mode.”</p><p>She said: </p><p>In the VC environment, there is a consolidation ongoing, it’s not visible yet and in my view, the worst is to come. Emerging general partners not being able to raise their next fund. In the venture world, they don’t shut down. It’s not like in the operating company world where a company goes bankrupt and literally fires people, closes the door, and that’s it. In the VC world, it’s more like they move into zombie mode. It’s like we are still managing our last fund, but we’re not raising anymore.</p><p>Our conversation covered a range of topics, including Gavet’s book, <em>Trampled by Unicorns</em>: <em>Big Tech’s Empathy Problem and How to Fix It</em>. We concluded our conversation, interrogating how tech has changed since she published the book and discussing what it would mean for brewing artificial intelligence regulation. </p><p>Give it a listen</p><p><em>Lightly edited podcast excerpts from my conversation with Maëlle Gavet:</em></p><p>What was the main thing that you wanted to change about Techstars?</p><p><strong>I wanted Techstars to become the best and largest pre-seed investor in the world.</strong> I thought that there were a lot of really good building blocks. The fundamentals were there, and there was also an opportunity to scale it further, streamline it, strengthen it, and provide more value to entrepreneurs, helping them get better terms, better exits, and better valuations. That’s a long process. The VC industry works in a very, very long cycle. So it’s not like you arrive and then three months later things change. But that was the idea of taking this great company to a whole different level. To start, when I would talk about Techstars, people would actually know who we are and what we do. <strong>And I remember announcing that I was joining Techstars to my network, and a few people, including venture capitalists from Silicon Valley who will remain unnamed, saying: Why are you joining a nonprofit? My answer was, this is not a nonprofit, this is an investment business and a pretty good one at that. It’s just that they never really position themselves as an investment business.</strong> And so part of the work was to change internally and externally, the image of Techstars to say, we are very large pre-seed investors. And by the way, as for Crunchbase, a few months ago, we officially became the largest pre-seed investor in the world.</p><p>What has been the company with the best return for Techstars?</p><p>We have some really, really cool companies that I like very much. Companies like <strong>Chainalysis</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/22/business/crypto-blockchain-tracking-chainalysis.html">made headlines</a> not long ago because they provide blockchain data and analysis to governments, banks and businesses around the globe. And when things like FTX happen, and it’s only the most famous but there have been multiple situations where figuring out what is happening in the blockchain, crypto world has been pretty critical for a lot of institutions. Chainalysis is usually the company that calls.</p><p>One that I liked very much is called <strong>Remitly</strong>. They’re a mobile payments service that enables users to make a person-to-person international money transfer. So that’s the tagline. What they do is that they allow to a large extent immigrants from all around the world to send money in a safe and cheap way to their families and to the people who need it. That's a $6 billion company. They went through an IPO in 2021. This is a company with a mission, which is amazing.</p><p>We’re talking about billion dollar plus companies, and we can also talk about smaller companies because we have 3,600 companies in our portfolio. We’ve got a bunch. But the one that I like a lot among our billion-dollar-plus companies is a company called <strong>Zipline</strong>. They design and manufacture these drones, and then they operate them to deliver vital medical products in Africa. It’s a $3 billion company. They did successful fundraising in April of this year. Again, what they’re doing really makes a lot of sense for the world, and the risk of using a Silicon Valley sentence: to make the world a better place. But the reason why it matters so much is because I deeply believe and so does my team that big money comes from solving big problems. Big problems usually are found in things that make the world a better place. Not always, but it does help. So that’s my $3 billion-plus favorite company, but we got quite a few others.</p><p>Are there standard terms for Techstars? If I’m an entrepreneur, what should I expect in terms of money and ownership?</p><p>We have standard terms and they’re public. So it’s $20,000 plus $100,000 convertible notes. And depending on the conversion of the note, we ended up on average about 8% of the capital in the company. Basically what we provide to founders is the capital, obviously. But there is what we call the Techstars formula. So it’s the $120k that I've just mentioned. It’s the program. Our programs are very intense. It’s a small class, very small classes — 10 to 15 companies. It’s very hands-on. You have the Techstars team, and these are Techstars employees dedicated to that particular program. These tend to be people who are former entrepreneurs themselves. </p><p>What is your read on the funding environment right now?</p><p>In the VC environment, there is a consolidation ongoing, it’s not visible yet and in my view, the worst is to come. Emerging general partners not being able to raise their next fund. In the venture world, they don’t shut down. It’s not like in the operating company world where a company goes bankrupt and literally fires people, closes the door, and that’s it. <strong>In the VC world, it’s more like they move into zombie mode.</strong> It’s like we are still managing our last fund, but we’re not raising anymore.</p><p>A lot of venture firms have not yet taken the full write-down on their valuation, which compounds the problem because a lot of institutional LPs have public and private portfolios and the public portfolios have taken the write-down. Valuations has dropped quite dramatically.</p><p>We came from a period where it was not abnormal for a venture firm to raise every two years, sometimes every year. And so a lot of the firms are now out in the market fundraising. And if you take a significant write down, then suddenly your performance on paper doesn’t look great. And so it can create a problem for you. <strong>So it’s not like they are in denial. I just think that they’re trying to keep the appearances. The institutional LP knows that so there’s like a double effect.</strong> The first one is most institutional LPs are over overexposed to VC because the VC hasn’t taken the write-down that the public market has so there’s like a denominator effect. And then the second reason is the LPs know when they look at the GP they invested in that some of them have not taken the full write down, and they’re like, okay, maybe we’re going to wait to see where all of that lands. <strong>And so VC environment is very tricky at the moment, and I think what we’re observing is a complete change of the guard, a complete reorganization of the venture space.</strong> It’s not over. My guess is that it’s probably another few another couple of years. At the outcome of that change, we're most likely going to see very different players really influencing the markets.</p><p>I would assume that over time, there’s less money available.</p><p><strong>There’s less easy money available.</strong> We have a little over 15,000 investors who have made an investment in Techstars, portfolio companies we’ve been connected with. So we talk to a lot of these people like we are deal flow to the VC industry, we’re not really a VC ourselves. <strong>And what we tell our portfolio companies is, it’s not that there is no money. There absolutely is some money, but it’s harder to get because the VC is going back to some fundamentals — you should probably do due diligence before you give a check of a few million dollars to a company.</strong> You are going to have to show a clear path to profitability — doesn’t mean that you have to be profitable, but it has to be clear and credible, not like you know, the hockey stick that makes you profitable in year 10 if all the planets align and you have no competition. And so that, by definition makes it a lot harder to create compelling cases. And then in a lot of cases, the VC will now ask, even at an early stage, to see some traction. We have companies that have raised recently very good rounds at seed and Series A levels, but they had a good track record a clear path to profitability, and a great product market fit. I think, <strong>if I had to summarize: Gone are the times where you could go and raise $5, $10, $15 million based on a napkin and a barely put together MVP [minimum viable product]. That’s not happening anymore unless you're in AI.</strong> And that's a different thing.</p><p>Some of the founders think the gloom and doom has been oversold. VCs want to get better terms, and it’s in VC’s interest to emphasize how bad things are. What do you say to that?</p><p>The valuation that we saw in 2021 and 2022 didn't make a lot of sense. We’re seeing a recalibration of the markets. <strong>We also say that to our portfolio companies: If you are being offered a down round, you probably should accept it because most likely, and obviously it's always on a case-by-case basis, but most likely, your last valuation was probably a little inflated, and the new valuation that you're getting is probably closer to reality.</strong> And so yes, it looks like you're down round. But maybe the way you should look at it is your previous round was an out of the ordinary round and this is the normal round. So it's not a down-round technically; it’s just a normal round.</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maëlle Gavet&lt;/strong&gt; and I first crossed paths about a decade ago when she was the CEO of the Russian e-commerce company Ozon. Then, we met up again when she was working as the chief operating officer for the SoftBank-backed real estate tech company Compass. A couple of months ago, I ran into Gavet at a networking dinner in New York City. I interrogated her about her two-and-half years so far as the chief executive officer of Techstars, the global pre-seed investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I invited Gavet on the &lt;em&gt;Newcomer &lt;/em&gt;podcast to talk about her time at Techstars and the state of the early stage market. You can listen on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomer/id1582647825&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/34NxWrRHHAU5uWG5RfnZIP?si=1f11d9417cba422c&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newcomerpod&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/substack-reader/id1581650857&quot;&gt;Substack’s app&lt;/a&gt; or wherever you get your podcasts. I’ve also included some excerpts from the discussion below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she said about the state of venture capital firms will strike a chord of fear with many of my readers. Gavet warned that many VC funds are entering “zombie mode.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the VC environment, there is a consolidation ongoing, it’s not visible yet and in my view, the worst is to come. Emerging general partners not being able to raise their next fund. In the venture world, they don’t shut down. It’s not like in the operating company world where a company goes bankrupt and literally fires people, closes the door, and that’s it. In the VC world, it’s more like they move into zombie mode. It’s like we are still managing our last fund, but we’re not raising anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our conversation covered a range of topics, including Gavet’s book, &lt;em&gt;Trampled by Unicorns&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Big Tech’s Empathy Problem and How to Fix It&lt;/em&gt;. We concluded our conversation, interrogating how tech has changed since she published the book and discussing what it would mean for brewing artificial intelligence regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lightly edited podcast excerpts from my conversation with Maëlle Gavet:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was the main thing that you wanted to change about Techstars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted Techstars to become the best and largest pre-seed investor in the world.&lt;/strong&gt; I thought that there were a lot of really good building blocks. The fundamentals were there, and there was also an opportunity to scale it further, streamline it, strengthen it, and provide more value to entrepreneurs, helping them get better terms, better exits, and better valuations. That’s a long process. The VC industry works in a very, very long cycle. So it’s not like you arrive and then three months later things change. But that was the idea of taking this great company to a whole different level. To start, when I would talk about Techstars, people would actually know who we are and what we do. &lt;strong&gt;And I remember announcing that I was joining Techstars to my network, and a few people, including venture capitalists from Silicon Valley who will remain unnamed, saying: Why are you joining a nonprofit? My answer was, this is not a nonprofit, this is an investment business and a pretty good one at that. It’s just that they never really position themselves as an investment business.&lt;/strong&gt; And so part of the work was to change internally and externally, the image of Techstars to say, we are very large pre-seed investors. And by the way, as for Crunchbase, a few months ago, we officially became the largest pre-seed investor in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been the company with the best return for Techstars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have some really, really cool companies that I like very much. Companies like &lt;strong&gt;Chainalysis&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/22/business/crypto-blockchain-tracking-chainalysis.html&quot;&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; not long ago because they provide blockchain data and analysis to governments, banks and businesses around the globe. And when things like FTX happen, and it’s only the most famous but there have been multiple situations where figuring out what is happening in the blockchain, crypto world has been pretty critical for a lot of institutions. Chainalysis is usually the company that calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One that I liked very much is called &lt;strong&gt;Remitly&lt;/strong&gt;. They’re a mobile payments service that enables users to make a person-to-person international money transfer. So that’s the tagline. What they do is that they allow to a large extent immigrants from all around the world to send money in a safe and cheap way to their families and to the people who need it. That&apos;s a $6 billion company. They went through an IPO in 2021. This is a company with a mission, which is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re talking about billion dollar plus companies, and we can also talk about smaller companies because we have 3,600 companies in our portfolio. We’ve got a bunch. But the one that I like a lot among our billion-dollar-plus companies is a company called &lt;strong&gt;Zipline&lt;/strong&gt;. They design and manufacture these drones, and then they operate them to deliver vital medical products in Africa. It’s a $3 billion company. They did successful fundraising in April of this year.

			<title><![CDATA[Not Exactly AR And Not Exactly VR (with Lauren Goode & Anand Agarawala)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The metaverse had been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/no-one-wants-to-spend-any-amount?amp%3Butm_source=substack&#38;amp%3Butm_medium=email#details">left for dead</a>. The massive hype for virtual worlds that we saw during the pandemic dissipated once we could all see our fellow humans in person again. </p><p>But last week Apple finally revealed its augmented reality device, the Apple Vision Pro. The tech giant that rarely misses the mark with its carefully thought through product releases revealed that it wanted people to strap on ski goggle-like devices, direct a computer with their eyeballs, click with their fingers, and video chat in a digital realm.</p><p>I invited <em>Wired </em>senior writer <strong>Lauren Goode</strong> and <strong>Anand Agarawala, </strong>CEO of the startup Spatial,<strong> </strong>on the show to talk about the new device. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-demo/">Goode got 30 minutes first-hand with the Apple Vision Pro</a>. So we spent the first part of the show interrogating Goode about her experience with the $3,500 device that’s expected to be released next year. </p><p>Goode told us that she didn’t think the device is truly augmented reality in the purist sense of the term. </p><p>“It’s not using any waveguide technology that refracts light and then puts it into your eyeballs. It’s not holographic or volumetric, but it is AR if you think about the literal definition of AR as augmenting your reality,” Goode said. “Once you are running computer applications into this space in front of you where you would typically be looking at your real world living room but actually you’re seeing apps and playing games and doing stuff, you are augmenting your reality. It’s conceptually AR.”</p><p>Agarawala has been hard at work on building tools for augmented reality devices for the past seven years at Spatial. The company builds 3D creation tools and hosts experiences across a range of devices, including virtual reality and augmented reality devices. </p><p>Agarawala is cheering for real competition among the big tech giants when it comes to developing these wearable computers. “The market at some point of maturity would need all the Big Tech companies to get involved. If you’re just the one company doing it, that means it’s probably not a big enough market,” he said. Apple’s entry into augmented reality “absolutely validates it,” Agarawala said. </p><p>On the episode, we talked about Meta CEO <strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754239/mark-zuckerberg-meta-apple-vision-pro-headset">comments</a> on the release of the Apple Vision Pro:</p><p>Apple finally announced their headset, so I want to talk about that for a second. I was really curious to see what they were gonna ship. And obviously I haven’t seen it yet, so I’ll learn more as we get to play with it and see what happens and how people use it.</p><p>From what I’ve seen initially, I’d say the good news is that there’s no kind of magical solutions that they have to any of the constraints on laws of physics that our teams haven’t already explored and thought of. They went with a higher resolution display, and between that and all the technology they put in there to power it, it costs seven times more and now requires so much energy that now you need a battery and a wire attached to it to use it. They made that design trade-off and it might make sense for the cases that they’re going for.</p><p>But look, I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this in a way that I think is really important. We innovate to make sure that our products are as accessible and affordable to everyone as possible, and that is a core part of what we do. And we have sold tens of millions of Quests.</p><p>More importantly, our vision for the metaverse and presence is fundamentally social. It’s about people interacting in new ways and feeling closer in new ways. Our device is also about being active and doing things. By contrast, every demo that they showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself. I mean, that could be the vision of the future of computing, but like, it’s not the one that I want. There’s a real philosophical difference in terms of how we’re approaching this. And seeing what they put out there and how they’re going to compete just made me even more excited and in a lot of ways optimistic that what we’re doing matters and is going to succeed.

			<title><![CDATA[The State of Consumer Investing With Benchmark's Sarah Tavel]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a sad state of affairs for consumer companies not named TikTok. </p><p>Poparazzi just <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/01/once-hot-photo-sharing-social-app-poparazzi-is-shutting-down/">shut down</a>. (At least some of the team <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1657829525894443011?s=20">went to</a> Instagram.) Popshop <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popshop-live-lays-off-staff-after-struggling-to-raise-new-funding-2022-7">is struggling</a>. The venture capital firm Benchmark helped establish both companies as consumer startups to watch by leading their Series A rounds. </p><p><strong>Sarah Tavel</strong>, who led the investment in Poparazzi and has worked closely with Popshop, agreed to come on the <em>Newcomer</em> podcast to talk about the brutal state of consumer startups. “Our deep belief at Benchmark is that our job is not to predict the future, but to try as best we can to see the present clearly,” Tavel told me.</p><p>Of course, it’s not just Benchmark’s once high-flying startups that are reeling. Andreessen Horowitz audio company Clubhouse <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/clubhouse-layoffs-half-employees-app-reset-1235597914/">laid off more than half</a> of its employees. Hype for the photo company BeReal seems to be dying down. (Searches for the company’s name on Google are at less than half their peak.) </p><p></p><p>“It is a really tough environment right now to build that type of company,” Tavel said about startups building for consumers. “It’s always been difficult, but the level of difficulty has been turned all the way on. Because right now, anybody building something in consumer has to compete with the most addictive consumer format that we’ve ever had — which is short video.”</p><p>Tavel, who co-led an early investment in Pinterest and then became the company’s first product manager, talked through some of the most promising opportunities in  startups. Artificial intelligence seems poised to create new consumer startups. Tavel flagged the legal artificial intelligence company EvenUp, which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bessemer-fights-to-win-350-million-valuation-ai-deal?rc=iatd7y">just raised</a> at a $350 million valuation from Bessemer, as one such promising startup. I marveled at the bootstrapped rise of Midjourney. </p><p>But, of course, many generative AI startups, especially ones building foundation models, are raising such large rounds that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1661067199199735808?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">it can be difficult</a> for a firm like Benchmark to rationalize an investment. </p><p>We also talked about one of Tavel’s most successful investments at Benchmark, Chainalysis. The blockchain data company raised $170 million at $8.6 billion last year. The <em>New York Times </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/22/business/crypto-blockchain-tracking-chainalysis.html">wrote a glowing profile</a> of the company last month.  </p><p>Tavel, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/after-the-fallout">who doesn’t like to announce</a> her startup investments, revealed that she has secretly invested in an unannounced NFT company.</p><p>“Crypto is a bad word now,” Tavel told me. “It’s really hard to train consumers to trust something again — once a consumer has made a first impression. It’s much easier to teach a user a first impression than to rewrite that first impression.”</p><p>Finally, I asked Tavel to give us a peek behind the curtain at Benchmark. <em>Fortune’s </em><strong>Jessica Mathews</strong> recently interviewed Benchmark’s <strong>Bill Gurley </strong>about his decision to step back.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/16/austin-bill-gurley-benchmark-venture-capital/">Mathews wrote</a>:</p><p>“The venture business, if you want to be at the top, requires insane, remarkable hustle… You have to live in fear that the next <a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a> is going to get funded by a firm that’s not yours,” he says. “Either you’re in there rowing as hard as you can, because we’re all a team, or you’re not.”</p><p>That said, he still has strong instincts about the future of tech. “If I were still active as a venture capitalist, I’d be looking at a lot of the vertical applications of A.I. I look at the coding stuff, and it’s insane… If you’re not using it, I think you’re probably writing your own death certificate as a programmer, because people are going to be so much more efficient. And the question is: What are other applications that have that kind of productivity boost or lift, and I think people are trying to figure that out.”</p><p>But in the end, it was a book by Steve Martin, <em>Born Standing Up</em>, that helped convince Gurley it was time to step back. “One day, [Martin] is in Vegas and he comes out, and the top row is empty, the first time he’s ever seen the top row empty. He quits the next day—never does standup again. And then he goes off and he does his banjo and his theater and his acting.… Like I said, I don’t think I ever played the stage, so I’d rather not say I’m the same. It influenced me. That notion influenced me.”</p><p>Today, the Benchmark partnership is made up of Tavel, <strong>Peter Fenton</strong>, <strong>Eric Vishria</strong>, <strong>Chetan Puttagunta</strong>, and <strong>Miles Grimshaw</strong>. </p><p>Tavel said about the firm, “We’ve always had a pretty simple idea, which is that there’s this creative destruction.”</p><p>“Once you start — there’s no training wheels. So you’re thrown into the deep end. You’re an equal partner and you’re expected to be 100% until the minute that you retire,” Tavel said. “And when you have an equal partnership, it kind of pushes you in the direction of just recognizing — as Bill said in that interview — the hustle may not be in you anymore. And if you feel that way, then the model — as was set up by the founders — is such that it’s time to raise your hand and move on.”</p><p>Of course, my understanding is that partners like Gurley, <strong>Matt Cohler</strong>, and <strong>Mitch Lasky</strong> remain fairly heavily involved at Benchmark even so. </p><p>“It’s like an affliction. The reason they’re here in the first place was because the curiosity and competitiveness and the drive for learning and relevance, being in the mix, that never leaves you,” Tavel said. “They are a significant portion of our LP base, they’re still there on Mondays, and I’m texting all of them all the time.”</p><p>Find the Podcast</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

And then he goes off and he does his banjo and his theater and his acting.… Like I said, I don’t think I ever played the stage, so I’d rather not say I’m the same. It influenced me. That notion influenced me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Benchmark partnership is made up of Tavel, &lt;strong&gt;Peter Fenton&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Vishria&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Chetan Puttagunta&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Miles Grimshaw&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavel said about the firm, “We’ve always had a pretty simple idea, which is that there’s this creative destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you start — there’s no training wheels. So you’re thrown into the deep end. You’re an equal partner and you’re expected to be 100% until the minute that you retire,” Tavel said. “And when you have an equal partnership, it kind of pushes you in the direction of just recognizing — as Bill said in that interview — the hustle may not be in you anymore. And if you feel that way, then the model — as was set up by the founders — is such that it’s time to raise your hand and move on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, my understanding is that partners like Gurley, &lt;strong&gt;Matt Cohler&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Mitch Lasky&lt;/strong&gt; remain fairly heavily involved at Benchmark even so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like an affliction. The reason they’re here in the first place was because the curiosity and competitiveness and the drive for learning and relevance, being in the mix, that never leaves you,” Tavel said. “They are a significant portion of our LP base, they’re still there on Mondays, and I’m texting all of them all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the Podcast&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Substack's Index Fund of Culture (with Chris Best and Hamish McKenzie)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I caught up with Substack co-founders <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/2-chris-best">Chris Best</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/3567-hamish-mckenzie">Hamish McKenzie</a> at Substack’s office in San Francisco last week. They’re fresh off raising a community fundraising round and launching their social network <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/notes"><em>Notes</em></a>. </p><p>I<a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/my-bet-on-substack-why-writers-like"> wrote </a>in March about my decision to invest $5,000 in Substack’s fundraising round, even though the company revealed that it had negative revenue in 2021:</p><p>I’m already compromised when it comes to Substack.

And while I already have plenty of financial exposure to Substack’s performance just by dint of running my business on Substack’s platform, I’m eager to have a chance to show my support.</p><p>So this is the rare — hopefully singular — interview where I can’t claim true editorial independence. I’m compromised on this one. Still, I think you’ll find it an informative and entertaining conversation. I’m able to bring my perspective as a Substack writer to the conversation and I can’t help but fish for drama and news.</p><p><em>This episode of Newcomer is brought to you by Vanta</em></p><p>Security is no longer a cost center — it’s a strategic growth engine that sets your business apart.

Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://vanta.com/newcomer">vanta.com/newcomer</a> to get started.</p><p>In our conversation, I asked McKenzie and Best about Twitter’s one-sided war with Substack. <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has at times throttled links to Substack. It is impossible to imbed tweets in Substack posts anymore. </p><p>Adding some intrigue to the tensions, Andreessen Horowitz, Substack’s largest outside investor, is an investor in Musk’s Twitter. </p><p>And, Musk actually long ago hired McKenzie, a former <em>PandoDaily</em> reporter, to write for Tesla.</p><p>“I try to think about Elon as little as possible,” McKenzie said in our conversation at Substack’s office. “What we’re trying to do here is not build the anti-Twitter or build the anti-Instagram or anything like that. We’re trying to build the first Substack. The vision for what we think it can become is an amazing, beautiful thing and it’s bigger and more important than social media.”</p><p>McKenzie acknowledged that “arguably Twitter is trying to kill Substack.”</p><p>I asked about newsletter godfather <strong>Ben Thompson’s</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://stratechery.com/2023/substack-notes-twitter-blocks-substack-substack-versus-writers/">critique of Substack’s community round in his newsletter</a>. </p><p>Thompson wrote in April:</p><p>We know that valuation because <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/07/substack-gets-writers-to-invest-but-doesnt-share-new-financial-info"><strong>Substack asked its writers to fund a round</strong></a> at the same $650 million post-money valuation it achieved in 2021, despite the fact <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/business/media/substack-venture-capital.html"><strong>the company failed to raise money last year</strong></a>; the company never released its 2022 financials.</p><p>Frankly, I think this request was shameful: Substack has rightly earned the affection of a lot of writers by providing them with a new way to earn money, and of course those writers want Substack to succeed. Keeping such a lofty valuation, though, is effectively asking for a donation from an audience that almost by definition doesn’t know any better. That doesn’t seem very writer friendly! Nor, for that matter, does this fight with Twitter. Again, I think this is a product bet that makes a lot of sense: Substack needs to take big swings if it’s ever going to reach its valuation. Writers, though, who need Twitter’s distribution, didn’t sign up for this fight; they are simply stuck in the middle.</p><p>We also talked about Best’s botched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/23681875/substack-notes-twitter-elon-musk-content-moderation-free-speech">podcast interview</a> with <em>The Verge’s</em> <strong>Nilay Patel</strong>. In the interview (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@decoderpod/video/7221602731998498094?lang=en">here’s a link to the key exchange</a>), Patel hammered Best on Substack’s stance on blocking overt racism on <em>Notes. </em>In that interview, Best declined to say that Substack would ban particular objectionable racist comments from the platform unilaterally. </p><p>In my conversation with him, Best continued to oppose “centralized censorship” on Substack’s platform. And he doubled-down on his answer, saying that he had “basically the same answer.”</p><p>Best said, “We do have a content policy. It allows a lot of stuff we don’t like. It bans only very extreme things. If people are putting things that are against the overall content policy, they are taken down by us. However, that allows a lot of stuff that we find very objectionable. Then we try to build a system that puts people in control of what they see and who they interact with.”</p><p>As should be pretty obvious from the conversation, I think that if Substack <em>Notes</em> is successful, it will actually be much more curated than many other social networks. Writers want to give their readers a premium, elevated experience — not just a platform that does the bare minimum of content moderation. So I’m optimistic over time that Substack will find ways to empower writers to curate the platform. Even though Substack often finds itself talking about free speech and tough moderation decisions, in many ways what the company has built is a system where writers are given the power to moderate the platform themselves. </p><p>The last thing I’ll tease from the conversation is that the Substack founders no longer come off as diametrically opposing to supporting advertising. Judge their answer for yourself.</p><p>In the conversation we name-dropped a bunch of newsletters and Substack writers, including <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/30107029-gergely-orosz">Gergely Orosz</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/626816-jesse-singal">Jesse Singal</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/4875576-heather-cox-richardson">Heather Cox Richardson</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/580004-matthew-yglesias">Matthew Yglesias</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/41856304-substack-writers">Substack Writers</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/12296303-andrew-sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/theankler">The Ankler.</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thebulwark">Bulwark+</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/2067309-bari-weiss">Bari Weiss</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thefreepress">The Free Press</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://substack.com/profile/21393502-the-pillar">The Pillar</a> </p><p>Give it a listen.</p><p>Find the Podcast</p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<title><![CDATA[Traffic Jam (with Ben Smith)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The blitzscaling funding model failed news companies. </p><p><em>Vice Media</em> — which raised more than $1 billion from the likes of TPG, Technology Crossover Ventures, and Disney — is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/media/vice-bankruptcy.html">reportedly</a> preparing to file for bankruptcy. </p><p><em>BuzzFeed</em> — which raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, General Atlantic, and NBCUniversal — just shut down its news division and has watched its stock price sink 95% since going public via a SPAC.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gawker, which successfully avoided the cash-burning approach, was brought down in a lawsuit funded by tech billionaire <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>. </p><p><em>This episode of Newcomer is brought to you by Vanta</em></p><p>Security is no longer a cost center — it’s a strategic growth engine that sets your business apart. That means it’s more important than ever to prove you handle customer data with the utmost integrity. </p><p>But demonstrating your security and compliance can be time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Until you use <strong>Vanta</strong>.</p><p>Vanta’s <strong>enterprise-ready Trust Management Platform</strong> empowers you to:</p><p>* Centralize and scale your security program</p><p>* Automate compliance for the most sought-after frameworks, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR</p><p>* Earn and maintain the trust of customers and vendors alike</p><p>With Vanta, you can save up to 400 hours and 85% of costs. Win more deals and enable growth quickly, easily, and without breaking the bank.</p><p><strong>For a limited time, Newcomer listeners get $1,000 off Vanta</strong>. Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://vanta.com/newcomer">vanta.com/newcomer</a> to get started.</p><p>In his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752">new book</a>, <em>Traffic: Genius, Rivalry, and Delusion in the Billion-Dollar Race to Go Viral</em>, former BuzzFeed editor-in-chief <strong>Ben Smith</strong><em> </em>takes stock of the heady days of media spending and snarky online writing. (Of course, for all his insistence that that spendy era of media is over, Smith is the co-founder of Semafor, a company that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/semafor-news-platform-launches-2022-10-18/">raised $25 million</a> — including about $10 million from <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong> — to build a new digital media business.)</p><p>I invited Smith on the podcast to talk about his new book. </p><p>I started the discussion by going back to <strong>David Carr’s</strong> 2012 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/business/media/at-buzzfeed-the-significant-and-the-silly.html">profile of BuzzFeed</a>. </p><p>Carr wrote at the time:</p><p>[W]ith the addition of Mr. Smith and his new hires, BuzzFeed is growing some serious news muscles under a silly, frilly skin, and added the header “2012” for election coverage. (More traditional news verticals will be rolled out in the coming months.) It’s gone well so far, with comScore showing 10.8 million unique visitors in December, more than double that of the same month in 2010.</p><p>Its business model, in part, capitalizes on the mix of high and low content; instead of banner ads, BuzzFeed works with companies like Pillsbury to create content ideal for sharing, including “10 Things You Never Knew You Could Do With a Crescent Roll.”</p><p>If it is successful, BuzzFeed will generate the kind of traffic that will rival behemoths like, yes, The Huffington Post. Mr. Peretti says that BuzzFeed makes a profit some months, but given the level of investment and growth — there are now 78 people in its Flatiron offices — the burn rate on that new chunk of capital is significant. “It’s fun to watch them make all these hires,” said Choire Sicha, the founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theawl.com/">The Awl</a> site and a veteran of the New York Web scene. “But it’s important that they don’t overspend. Web ad rates are what they are and that isn’t going to change.”</p><p>Then I turned the conversation to former Gawker editor <strong>Max Read’s</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/04/21/traffic-buzzfeed-gawker-ben-smith/">review</a> of <em>Traffic. </em></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/04/21/traffic-buzzfeed-gawker-ben-smith/">Read writes</a>: </p><p>In the end, only one character in “Traffic” can really be said to have any vision. In 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger offered to buy BuzzFeed for $650 million.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;The blitzscaling funding model failed news companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice Media&lt;/em&gt; — which raised more than $1 billion from the likes of TPG, Technology Crossover Ventures, and Disney — is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/media/vice-bankruptcy.html&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; preparing to file for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; — which raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, General Atlantic, and NBCUniversal — just shut down its news division and has watched its stock price sink 95% since going public via a SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Gawker, which successfully avoided the cash-burning approach, was brought down in a lawsuit funded by tech billionaire &lt;strong&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode of Newcomer is brought to you by Vanta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is no longer a cost center — it’s a strategic growth engine that sets your business apart. That means it’s more important than ever to prove you handle customer data with the utmost integrity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But demonstrating your security and compliance can be time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Until you use &lt;strong&gt;Vanta&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanta’s &lt;strong&gt;enterprise-ready Trust Management Platform&lt;/strong&gt; empowers you to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Centralize and scale your security program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Automate compliance for the most sought-after frameworks, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Earn and maintain the trust of customers and vendors alike&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Vanta, you can save up to 400 hours and 85% of costs. Win more deals and enable growth quickly, easily, and without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a limited time, Newcomer listeners get $1,000 off Vanta&lt;/strong&gt;. Go to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://vanta.com/newcomer&quot;&gt;vanta.com/newcomer&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752&quot;&gt;new book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Traffic: Genius, Rivalry, and Delusion in the Billion-Dollar Race to Go Viral&lt;/em&gt;, former BuzzFeed editor-in-chief &lt;strong&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;takes stock of the heady days of media spending and snarky online writing. (Of course, for all his insistence that that spendy era of media is over, Smith is the co-founder of Semafor, a company that &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/semafor-news-platform-launches-2022-10-18/&quot;&gt;raised $25 million&lt;/a&gt; — including about $10 million from &lt;strong&gt;Sam Bankman-Fried&lt;/strong&gt; — to build a new digital media business.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I invited Smith on the podcast to talk about his new book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started the discussion by going back to &lt;strong&gt;David Carr’s&lt;/strong&gt; 2012 &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/business/media/at-buzzfeed-the-significant-and-the-silly.html&quot;&gt;profile of BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr wrote at the time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[W]ith the addition of Mr. Smith and his new hires, BuzzFeed is growing some serious news muscles under a silly, frilly skin, and added the header “2012” for election coverage. (More traditional news verticals will be rolled out in the coming months.) It’s gone well so far, with comScore showing 10.8 million unique visitors in December, more than double that of the same month in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its business model, in part, capitalizes on the mix of high and low content; instead of banner ads, BuzzFeed works with companies like Pillsbury to create content ideal for sharing, including “10 Things You Never Knew You Could Do With a Crescent Roll.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is successful, BuzzFeed will generate the kind of traffic that will rival behemoths like, yes, The Huffington Post. Mr. Peretti says that BuzzFeed makes a profit some months, but given the level of investment and growth — there are now 78 people in its Flatiron offices — the burn rate on that new chunk of capital is significant. “It’s fun to watch them make all these hires,” said Choire Sicha, the founder of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theawl.com/&quot;&gt;The Awl&lt;/a&gt; site and a veteran of the New York Web scene. “But it’s important that they don’t overspend. Web ad rates are what they are and that isn’t going to change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I turned the conversation to former Gawker editor &lt;strong&gt;Max Read’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/04/21/traffic-buzzfeed-gawker-ben-smith/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Traffic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/04/21/traffic-buzzfeed-gawker-ben-smith/&quot;&gt;Read writes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, only one character in “Traffic” can really be said to have any vision. In 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger offered to buy BuzzFeed for $650 million. In the book’s strangest and funniest scene, a nightmare blunt rotation of Smith, Peretti, BuzzFeed video chief Ze Frank and BuzzFeed president Jon Steinberg get high on a hotel balcony in Los Angeles and discuss the offer. Frank and Smith urge an ambivalent Peretti to turn down the offer, worrying that “Disney’s corporate culture would stifle” Buzzfeed’s creativity. Not so much Steinberg, the company’s money man, who gets “down on his knees on the balcony to plead with Jonah to take the deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank and Smith would go on to win the argument; they and Peretti saw BuzzFeed’s monster traffic as the key to their dreams of a burgeoning, independent media empire.

			<title><![CDATA[Open-Source AI: Replit's Amjad Masad & Hugging Face's Clem Delangue]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, we have a bonus double episode of the <em>Newcomer </em>podcast for you — two conversations from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/">Cerebral Valley AI Summit</a> last week. </p><p>Part 1: Replit CEO Amjad Masad and Hugging Face Clément Delangue</p><p>Together, they’re a charismatic open-source alliance.</p><p>We talked about the threat posed by OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft, the questions around Replit and Hugging Face’s business models, and where they would like to see more development in artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>Charles Hudson</strong>, at Precursor, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-cerebral-valley-ai-summit-charles-hudson/?trackingId=6TkxjMHmQue4%2FlxXllgjkg%3D%3D">wrote up a smart </a>reflection on the Cerebral Valley event and one of his main takeaways was about open-source companies like Replit and Hugging Face. Hudson wrote:</p><p><strong>Open-source applications will play a big role in this early phase of experimentation. </strong>One of the more refreshing and interesting things for me to hear was the different approaches that open-source companies were taking relative to their more commercially-minded peers. It wasn’t simply about business models or go to market approaches — it felt way more fundamental and philosophical about how they wanted to see AI deployed and governed. I didn’t have a full appreciation for that difference before the event, but it was one of the things that I was most struck by at the event.</p><p><em>The Cerebral Valley AI Summit is presented by</em></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://samsungnext.com/"><strong>Samsung Next</strong></a><strong> invests in the boldest and most ambitious founders.</strong></p><p>Tell us about your company.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today, we have a bonus double episode of the &lt;em&gt;Newcomer &lt;/em&gt;podcast for you — two conversations from the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/&quot;&gt;Cerebral Valley AI Summit&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Replit CEO Amjad Masad and Hugging Face Clément Delangue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they’re a charismatic open-source alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talked about the threat posed by OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft, the questions around Replit and Hugging Face’s business models, and where they would like to see more development in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hudson&lt;/strong&gt;, at Precursor, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-cerebral-valley-ai-summit-charles-hudson/?trackingId=6TkxjMHmQue4%2FlxXllgjkg%3D%3D&quot;&gt;wrote up a smart &lt;/a&gt;reflection on the Cerebral Valley event and one of his main takeaways was about open-source companies like Replit and Hugging Face. Hudson wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-source applications will play a big role in this early phase of experimentation. &lt;/strong&gt;One of the more refreshing and interesting things for me to hear was the different approaches that open-source companies were taking relative to their more commercially-minded peers. It wasn’t simply about business models or go to market approaches — it felt way more fundamental and philosophical about how they wanted to see AI deployed and governed. I didn’t have a full appreciation for that difference before the event, but it was one of the things that I was most struck by at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cerebral Valley AI Summit is presented by&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://samsungnext.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; invests in the boldest and most ambitious founders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell us about your company. We’d love to meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Adept CEO David Luan and Greylock partner Saam Motamedi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On stage with Luan and Motamedi, a major investor in Adept, I wanted to know how Adept planned to compete with foundation models like OpenAI and Anthropic — especially now that OpenAI has introduced plugins that allow third-parties to easily connect to ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adept is building an AI model that mirrors humans input into computers. It’s a different approach than the language models that are getting built by other foundation model companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also asked Luan about his time at OpenAI and at Google.

			<title><![CDATA[This Kicked Off With a Dinner With Elon Musk Years Ago (with Reid Hoffman)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the first episode of the <em>Newcomer </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/newcomer-the-podcast">podcast</a>, I sat down with <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> — the PayPal mafia member, LinkedIn co-founder, Greylock partner, and Microsoft board member. Hoffman had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidhoffman_ai-like-most-transformative-technologies-activity-7037481313934741504-wJjU?utm_source=share&#38;utm_medium=member_desktop">just stepped off</a> OpenAI’s board of directors. Hoffman traced his interest in artificial intelligence back to a conversation with <strong>Elon Musk</strong>.</p><p>“This kicked off, actually, in fact, with a dinner with Elon Musk years ago,” Hoffman said. </p><p>Musk told Hoffman that he needed to dive into artificial intelligence during conversations about a decade ago. “This is part of how I operate,” Hoffman remembers. “Smart people from my network tell me things, and I go and do things. And so I dug into it and I’m like, ‘Oh, yes, we have another wave coming.’”</p><p><em>This episode of Newcomer is brought to you by Vanta</em></p><p>Security is no longer a cost center — it’s a strategic growth engine that sets your business apart. That means it’s more important than ever to prove you handle customer data with the utmost integrity. </p><p>But demonstrating your security and compliance can be time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanta.com/newcomer">Until you use </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanta.com/newcomer"><strong>Vanta</strong></a>.</p><p>Vanta’s <strong>enterprise-ready Trust Management Platform</strong> empowers you to:</p><p>* Centralize and scale your security program</p><p>* Automate compliance for the most sought-after frameworks, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR</p><p>* Earn and maintain the trust of customers and vendors alike</p><p>With Vanta, you can save up to 400 hours and 85% of costs. Win more deals and enable growth quickly, easily, and without breaking the bank.</p><p><strong>For a limited time, Newcomer listeners get $1,000 off Vanta</strong>. Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://vanta.com/newcomer">vanta.com/newcomer</a> to get started.</p><p>Why I Wanted to Talk to Reid Hoffman & What I Took Away</p><p>Hoffman is a social network personified. Even his journey to something as wonky as artificial intelligence is told through his connections with people. In a world of algorithms and code, Hoffman is upfront about the extent to which human connections decide Silicon Valley’s trajectory. (Of course they are paired with profound technological developments that are far larger than any one person or network.)</p><p>When it comes to the rapidly developing future powered by large language models, a big question in my mind is <em>who exactly decides how these language models work?</em> </p><p>Sydney <a target="_blank" href="https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/">appeared</a> in Microsoft Bing and then disappeared. Microsoft executives can dispatch our favorite hallucinations without public input. Meanwhile, masses of images can be gobbled up without asking their creators and then the resulting image generation tools can be open-sourced to the world. </p><p>It feels like AI super powers come and go with little notice. </p><p>It’s a world full of contradictions. There’s constant talk of utopias and dystopias and yet startups are raising conventional venture capital financing.</p><p>The most prominent player in artificial intelligence — OpenAI — is a non-profit that raised from Tiger Global. It celebrates its openness in its name and yet competes with companies whose technology is actually open-sourced. OpenAI’s governance structure and priorities largely remain a mystery. </p><p>Finally, unlike tech’s conservative billionaires who throw their money into politics, in the case of Hoffman, here is a tech overlord that I seem to mostly agree with politically. I wanted to know what that would be like. Is it just good marketing? And where exactly is his heart and political head at right now?</p><p>I thought he delivered. I didn’t feel like he was dodging my questions, even in a world where maintaining such a wide network requires diplomacy. Hoffman seemed eager and open — even if he started to bristle at what he called my “edgy words.”</p><p>Some Favorite Quotes</p><p>We covered a lot of ground in our conversation. We talked about AI sentience and humans’ failures to identify consciousness within non-human beings. We talked about the coming rise in AI cloud compute spending and how Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are positioned in the AI race.</p><p>Hoffman said he had one major condition for getting involved in OpenAI back in the early days when Musk was still on board.</p><p>“My price for participation was to ask Elon to stop saying the word “robocalypse,” Hoffman told me. “Because I thought that the problem was it’s very catchy and it evokes fear.”</p><p>I asked Hoffman why he thought Musk got involved in artificial intelligence in the first place when Musk seems so worried about how it might develop. </p><p><em>Why get the ball rolling down the hill at all</em>, I wondered?</p><p>Hoffman replied that many people in the field of artificial intelligence had “messiah complexes.”</p><p>“It’s the <em>I am the one who must bring this</em> — Prometheus, the fire to humanity,” Hoffman said. “And you’re like, ‘Okay, I kind of think it should be <em>us</em> versus an individual.’” </p><p>He went on, “Now, <em>us</em> can’t be 8 billion people — <em>us</em> is a small group. But I think, more or less, you see the folks who are steering with a moral compass try to say, <em>how do I get at least 10 to 15 people beyond myself with their hands on the steering wheel in deep conversations in order to make sure you get there?</em> <em>And then let’s make sure that we’re having the conversations with the right communities.”</em></p><p>I raised the possibility that this merely suggested oligarchic control of artificial intelligence rather than dictatorial control. </p><p>We also discussed Hoffman’s politics, including his thoughts on Joe Biden and “woke” politics. I asked him about the state of his friendship with fellow PayPal mafia member <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>. </p><p>“I basically am sympathetic to people as long as they are legitimately and earnestly committed to the dialogue and discussion of truth between them and not committed otherwise,” Hoffman said. “There are folks from the PayPal years that I don’t really spend much time talking to. There are others that I do continue because that conversation about discovering who we are and who we should be is really important. And you can’t allow your own position to be the definer.”</p><p>I suggested that Thiel’s public views sometimes seemed insincere.</p><p>“Oh, that’s totally corrosive,” Hoffman said. “And as much as that’s happening, it’s terrible. And that’s one of the things that in conversations I have, I push people, including Peter, on a lot.”</p><p><strong>Give it a listen.</strong></p><p>Find the Podcast</p><p>Read the Transcript</p><p>Eric: Reid, thank you so much for coming on the show. I'm very excited for this conversation. You know, I'm getting ready for my own AI conference at the end of this month, so hopefully this is sort of a prep by the end of this conversation, we'll all be super smart and ready for that. I feel like there've been so many rounds of sort of AI as sort of the buzzword of the day.</p><p>This clearly seems the hottest. When did you get into this moment of it? I mean, obviously you just stepped off the Open AI board. You were on that board. Like how, when did you start to see this movement that we're experiencing right now coming.</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> Well, it's funny because my undergraduate major was artificial intelligence and cognitive science. So I've, I've been around the hoop for multiple waves for a long time and I think this kicked off actually, in fact, with a dinner with Elon Musk years ago. You know, 10-ish years ago, Elon and I would have dinner about once a quarter and he's like, well, are you paying attention to this AI stuff?</p><p>And I'm like, well, I majored in it and you know, I know about this stuff. He's like, no, you need to get back involved. And I was like, all right. </p><p>This is part of how I operate is smart people from my network tell me things and I go and do things. And so I dug into it and I went, oh yes, we have another wave coming.</p><p>And this was probably about seven or eight years ago, when I, when I saw the beginning of the wave or the seismic event. Maybe it was a seismic event out at sea and I was like, okay, there's gonna be a tsunami here and we should start getting ready cause the tsunami is actually gonna be amazingly great and interesting.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> And that—is that the beginning of Open AI?</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> Open AI is later. What I did is I went and made connections with the kind of the heads of every AI lab and major company because I concluded that I thought that the AI revolution will be primarily driven by large companies initially because of the scale compute requirements.</p><p>And so, you know, talked to Demis Hassabis, met Mustafa Suleyman, talked to Yann LeCun, talked to Jeff Dean, you know, all these kind of folks and kind of, you know, built all that. And then it was later in conversations with Sam and Elon that I said, look, we need to do something that's a for pro humanity. Not just commercial effort. </p><p>And my price for participation, cause I thought it was a great idea, but my price for participation was to ask Elon to stop saying the word robocalypse. Because I thought that the problem was that it's very catchy and it evokes fear. And actually, in fact, one of the things I think about this whole area is that it's so much more interesting and has so much amazing opportunity for humanity.</p><p>A little bit like, I don't know if you saw the Atlantic article I wrote that we evolve ourselves through technology and I'm, you know, going to be doing some writings around describing AI as augmented intelligence versus artificial intelligence. And I wanted to kind of build that positive, optimistic case that I think is the higher probability that I think we can shape towards and so forth.</p><p>So it's like, okay, I'm in, but no more Robocalypse.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> I appreciate the ultimate sort of network person that you tell the story through people. I always appreciate when the origin stories of technology actually come through the human beings. With Elon in particular, I'm sort of confused by his position because it seems like he's very afraid of AI.</p><p>And if that's the case, why would you want to, like, do anything to sort of get the ball rolling down the hill? Like, isn't there a sort of just like, stay away from it, man, if you think it's so bad. How do you see his thinking? And I'm sure it's evolved.</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> Well, I think his instinct for the good and the challenging of this is he tends to think AI will only be good if I'm the one who's in control.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> Sort of, yeah.</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> Yeah. And this is actually somewhat replete within the modern AI field. Not everybody but this. And Elon is a public enough figure that I think, you know, making this comment of him is not talking at a school.</p><p>Other people would, there's a surprising number of Messiah complexes in the field of AI, and, and it's the, I am the one who must bring this, you know, Prometheus, you know, the Fire to humanity. And you're like, okay, I kind of think it should be us, right? Versus an individual. Now us can't be 8 billion people, us as a small group, but I think more or less you see the, the folks who are steering with a moral compass try to say, how do I get at least 10 to 15 people beyond myself with their hands on the steering wheel in deep conversations in order to make sure you get there and then let, let's make sure that we're having the conversations with the right communities.</p><p>Like if you say, well, is this going to, you know, institutionalize, ongoing, um, you know, power structures or racial bias, something else? Well, we're talking to the people to make sure that we're going to minimize that, especially over time and navigate it as a real issue. And so those are the, like, that's the kind of anti Messiah complex, which, which is more or less the efforts that I tend to get involved in.</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> Right. At least sort of oligarchy, of AI control instead of just dictatorship of it.</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> Well, yeah, and it depends a little bit, even on oligarchy, look, things are built by small numbers of people. It's just a fact, right? Like, there aren't more than, you know, a couple of founders, maybe maximum five in any, any particular thing. There is, you know, there's reasons why. When you have a construction project, you have a head of construction, right?</p><p>Et cetera. The important thing is to make sure that's why you have, why you have a CEO, you have a board of directors. That's why you have, you know, you say, well, do we have the right thing where a person is accountable to a broader group? And that broader group feels their governance responsibility seriously.</p><p>So oligarchy is a—</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> a charged</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> is a charged word. And I,</p><p><strong>Eric:</strong> There’s a logic to it. I'm not, I'm not using it to say it doesn't make sense that you want the people to really understand it around, around it. Um, I mean, specifically with Open AI, I mean, you, you just stepped off the board. You're also on the board of Microsoft, which is obviously a very significant player.</p><p>In this future, I mean, it's hard to be open. I get a little frustrated with the “open” in “Open AI” because I feel like there's a lot that I don't understand. I'm like, maybe they should change the name a little bit, but is it still a charity in your mind? I mean, it's obviously raised from Tiger Global, the ultimate prophet maker.</p><p>Like, how should we think about the sort of core ambitions of Open AI?</p><p><strong>Reid:</strong> Well, um, one, the board I was on was a fine one and they've been very diligent about making sure that all of the controls, including for the subsidiary company are from the 501(C)(3) and diligent to its mission, which is staffed by people on the 501(C)(3) board with the responsibilities of being on a 5 0 1 board, which is being in service of the mission, not doing, you know, private inurement and other kinds of things.</p><p>And so I actually think it is fundamentally still a 501(C)(3). The challenge is if you kind of say, you look at this and say, well, in order to be a successful player in the modern sca

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;For the first episode of the &lt;em&gt;Newcomer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/newcomer-the-podcast&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, I sat down with &lt;strong&gt;Reid Hoffman&lt;/strong&gt; — the PayPal mafia member, LinkedIn co-founder, Greylock partner, and Microsoft board member. Hoffman had &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidhoffman_ai-like-most-transformative-technologies-activity-7037481313934741504-wJjU?utm_source=share&amp;#38;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;just stepped off&lt;/a&gt; OpenAI’s board of directors. Hoffman traced his interest in artificial intelligence back to a conversation with &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This kicked off, actually, in fact, with a dinner with Elon Musk years ago,” Hoffman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk told Hoffman that he needed to dive into artificial intelligence during conversations about a decade ago. “This is part of how I operate,” Hoffman remembers. “Smart people from my network tell me things, and I go and do things. And so I dug into it and I’m like, ‘Oh, yes, we have another wave coming.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode of Newcomer is brought to you by Vanta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is no longer a cost center — it’s a strategic growth engine that sets your business apart.

Go to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://vanta.com/newcomer&quot;&gt;vanta.com/newcomer&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why I Wanted to Talk to Reid Hoffman &amp; What I Took Away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman is a social network personified. Even his journey to something as wonky as artificial intelligence is told through his connections with people. In a world of algorithms and code, Hoffman is upfront about the extent to which human connections decide Silicon Valley’s trajectory. (Of course they are paired with profound technological developments that are far larger than any one person or network.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the rapidly developing future powered by large language models, a big question in my mind is &lt;em&gt;who exactly decides how these language models work?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Bing and then disappeared. Microsoft executives can dispatch our favorite hallucinations without public input. Meanwhile, masses of images can be gobbled up without asking their creators and then the resulting image generation tools can be open-sourced to the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels like AI super powers come and go with little notice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a world full of contradictions. There’s constant talk of utopias and dystopias and yet startups are raising conventional venture capital financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most prominent player in artificial intelligence — OpenAI — is a non-profit that raised from Tiger Global. It celebrates its openness in its name and yet competes with companies whose technology is actually open-sourced. OpenAI’s governance structure and priorities largely remain a mystery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, unlike tech’s conservative billionaires who throw their money into politics, in the case of Hoffman, here is a tech overlord that I seem to mostly agree with politically. I wanted to know what that would be like. Is it just good marketing? And where exactly is his heart and political head at right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought he delivered. I didn’t feel like he was dodging my questions, even in a world where maintaining such a wide network requires diplomacy. Hoffman seemed eager and open — even if he started to bristle at what he called my “edgy words.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Favorite Quotes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We covered a lot of ground in our conversation. We talked about AI sentience and humans’ failures to identify consciousness within non-human beings. We talked about the coming rise in AI cloud compute spending and how Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are positioned in the AI race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman said he had one major condition for getting involved in OpenAI back in the early days when Musk was still on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My price for participation was to ask Elon to stop saying the word “robocalypse,” Hoffman told me. “Because I thought that the problem was it’s very catchy and it evokes fear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Hoffman why he thought Musk got involved in artificial intelligence in the first place when Musk seems so worried about how it might develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why get the ball rolling down the hill at all&lt;/em&gt;, I wondered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman replied that many people in the field of artificial intelligence had “messiah complexes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the &lt;em&gt;I am the one who must bring this&lt;/em&gt; — Prometheus, the fire to humanity,” Hoffman said. “And you’re like, ‘Okay, I kind of think it should be &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; versus an individual.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on, “Now, &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; can’t be 8 billion people — &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; is a small group. But I think, more or less, you see the folks who are steering with a moral compass try to say, &lt;em&gt;how do I get at least 10 to 15 people beyond myself with their hands on the steering wheel in deep conversations in order to make sure you get there?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;And then let’s make sure that we’re having the conversations with the right communities.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I raised the possibility that this merely suggested oligarchic control of artificial intelligence rather than dictatorial control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also discussed Hoffman’s politics, including his thoughts on Joe Biden and “woke” politics. I asked him about the state of his friendship with fellow PayPal mafia member &lt;strong&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I basically am sympathetic to people as long as they are legitimately and earnestly committed to the dialogue and discussion of truth between them and not committed otherwise,” Hoffman said. “There are folks from the PayPal years that I don’t really spend much time talking to. There are others that I do continue because that conversation about discovering who we are and who we should be is really important. And you can’t allow your own position to be the definer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suggested that Thiel’s public views sometimes seemed insincere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh, that’s totally corrosive,” Hoffman said. “And as much as that’s happening, it’s terrible. And that’s one of the things that in conversations I have, I push people, including Peter, on a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give it a listen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the Podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the Transcript&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric: Reid, thank you so much for coming on the show.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m pleased to announce that I’m introducing a new podcast and starting a YouTube channel. I’m calling it “Newcomer” — like this newsletter. </p><p>What can I say? It’s a good name.</p><p>The show kicks off tomorrow with an interview with LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>. </p><p>Hoffman just stepped off OpenAI’s board of directors. We talk about that decision, AI sentience, the PayPal mafia, cloud compute spending, Joe Biden’s presidency, and much more. I think you’ll enjoy the episode.</p><p>For the new show, I’ve got interviews lined up with investor and former top Tesla and Lyft executive <strong>Jon McNeill</strong> and with Lightspeed Venture Partners founder and managing director <strong>Ravi Mhatre</strong>.</p><p>I’m also going to publish some of the conversations from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/">Cerebral Valley AI Summit</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomer-podcast/id1582647825">podcast</a> feed and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@newcomertech">YouTube channel</a>. </p><p>In that vein, I’m happy to announce that <strong>Clem Delangue</strong>, the CEO of Hugging Face, and <strong>Amjad Masad</strong>, the CEO of Replit, are scheduled to sit down with me together at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit on March 30. (Founders and CEOs <a target="_blank" href="https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/">can still apply this week to attend</a> the one-day conference in Hayes Valley. We’ve been overwhelmed with investor interest to attend.)</p><p><em>Newcomer</em>, the weekly podcast, will post on Tuesdays. I’ll send it to newsletter subscribers and publish it to <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomer-podcast/id1582647825">Apple podcasts</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/34NxWrRHHAU5uWG5RfnZIP?si=fea1740b515b45bb">Spotify</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@newcomertech">YouTube</a>. <a target="_blank" href="mailto:eric@newcomer.co">Email me</a> with guest ideas. </p><p>I’ll publish summaries of the episodes here in the newsletter.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to announce that I’m introducing a new podcast and starting a YouTube channel. I’m calling it “Newcomer” — like this newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can I say? It’s a good name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show kicks off tomorrow with an interview with LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner &lt;strong&gt;Reid Hoffman&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman just stepped off OpenAI’s board of directors. We talk about that decision, AI sentience, the PayPal mafia, cloud compute spending, Joe Biden’s presidency, and much more. I think you’ll enjoy the episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new show, I’ve got interviews lined up with investor and former top Tesla and Lyft executive &lt;strong&gt;Jon McNeill&lt;/strong&gt; and with Lightspeed Venture Partners founder and managing director &lt;strong&gt;Ravi Mhatre&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to publish some of the conversations from the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/&quot;&gt;Cerebral Valley AI Summit&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomer-podcast/id1582647825&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; feed and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newcomertech&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that vein, I’m happy to announce that &lt;strong&gt;Clem Delangue&lt;/strong&gt;, the CEO of Hugging Face, and &lt;strong&gt;Amjad Masad&lt;/strong&gt;, the CEO of Replit, are scheduled to sit down with me together at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit on March 30. (Founders and CEOs &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cerebralvalleysummit.com/&quot;&gt;can still apply this week to attend&lt;/a&gt; the one-day conference in Hayes Valley. We’ve been overwhelmed with investor interest to attend.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newcomer&lt;/em&gt;, the weekly podcast, will post on Tuesdays. I’ll send it to newsletter subscribers and publish it to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomer-podcast/id1582647825&quot;&gt;Apple podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/34NxWrRHHAU5uWG5RfnZIP?si=fea1740b515b45bb&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newcomertech&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:eric@newcomer.co&quot;&gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt; with guest ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll publish summaries of the episodes here in the newsletter.

			<title><![CDATA[Another Shoe to Drop (w/Jeremy Levine)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bessemer Venture Partners’ <strong>Jeremy Levine </strong>is someone who keeps his head when others are losing theirs. </p><p>He’s long been wary of tech exuberance while being a long-term optimist about the transformative power of technology. </p><p>A board member at Pinterest and Shopify, Levine described his investing style to me for this week’s <em>Dead Cat </em>podcast: “I don’t like to go where all the cool kids are, where all the popular kids are. I like to kind of go off in the corner of the playground and find someone who’s doing something over there that’s really compelling that most people are prepared to dismiss or aren’t that excited about.”</p><p>I wanted to have Levine on the podcast to explain the tech downturn. Levine has been investing at Bessemer for over two decades. I wondered, <em>how does this moment compare to the dot-com bust and the Great Recession? </em>On the podcast, Levine traces the ebbs and flows of tech euphoria while giving concrete math to the pain of down rounds. </p><p>‘The entire world smoked a giant joint and was high as a kite’</p><p>He delivered quite the diatribe when I asked him to compare the present moment to the dot-com bust:</p><p>When I joined the venture industry in 2001, I looked at these entrepreneurs who built businesses and these venture capitalists who funded them from ’96 to 2000 and I was jealous. Oh my lord, they generated enormous value and enormous wealth in such a short time. And I said to myself, the world is never going to get this crazy again. The entire world smoked a giant joint and was high as a kite, and what fun it would have been to be part of that, but I missed the party. But I thought, you know, it’s really rewarding and fun and challenging to find compelling entrepreneurs and invest in startups. So even though it’s never gonna get as good as it was in 2000 again, I’m going to try to make this my career because I think I’ll find it fun. </p><p>And lo and behold, 20 years later, it happened again: Someone passed the joint around the party a second time, and no one remembered what happened the first time, and things got crazy. So in that sense, it’s really similar. Enormous wealth was created, enormous companies were created. But the difference is that when that party ended — at the end of 2021 — it wasn’t three or four companies left standing. It was dozens and dozens of strong public companies, and hundreds of really interesting private companies. Now, not every unicorn and not every company that raised a lot of money will be successful. But the industry is, I would say, two orders of magnitude larger than it was in 2000.</p><p>He argued that he believed there was still “another shoe to drop” in this tech downturn. He said venture firms were reserving more money to make follow-on investments for their existing portfolio companies, giving them less dry powder with which to make new investments. “I think we’re in a little bit of that spiral,” Levine said.</p><p>The Anti-Portfolio</p><p>Back in July 2021, amidst the final heady months of the bull market, I profiled Bessemer and Levine in an in-depth story titled, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-anti-portfolio"><em>The Anti-Portfolio</em></a>. (Still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-anti-portfolio">worth a read</a> if you missed it.) An undercurrent in the piece was that Bessemer had smartly invested early in some of the tech industry’s most popular public stocks like Shopify and Twilio but that the firm had sold down its positions before a massive run-up in their value on the public markets. Now, with Twilio down 70% and Shopify down 52% over the past 12 months, Bessemer’s decision to cash in its winners seems more rational. </p><p>I asked Levine whether he felt vindicated.</p><p>“We’ve made every mistake possible,” he told me. “But we’ve also gotten some things right. And so with the benefit of hindsight, we distributed our stock in Shopify way too early. And at the same time, we held onto some stocks in 2021 a bit too long. I think we’re not all that focused on getting that exactly right. Of course, we’re always trying to do better. But the real win, if you will, and the excitement and what motivates us is to invest in a company like Shopify or Auth0 when it’s really small and to nurture it and help that company become really big. And if you manage to top tick and exit your position … all the power to you. That’s just not that interesting of a game.”</p><p>Give it a listen</p><p>Read the automated transcript</p><p><em>P.S.

			<title><![CDATA[Does That Mean the Cat's Dead?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tom Dotan</strong>, <strong>Katie Benner</strong>, and I became friends in San Francisco back in 2014 when we all worked as technology reporters at <em>The Information. </em>But we didn’t achieve that core pillar of modern friendship until August 2021 when we started a podcast together. </p><p><em>Insider</em> generously let Tom co-host the podcast with me — and Katie, a reporter at the <em>New York Times</em>, came on every few episodes as a regular special guest.</p><p>A year and a half ago we kicked off the show with <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/episode-1-interview-with-parker-conrad/id1582647825?i=1000532985626">an interview</a> of Rippling CEO <strong>Parker Conrad</strong>. Since then, publishing most Tuesdays, we’ve pumped out 69 episodes and have built up a loyal following of listeners for our niche tech media podcast. With our intense focus on how the media covers technology stories, we’ve become a must-listen for newsrooms, tech public relations shops, startup world movers and shakers, and tech industry onlookers. </p><p>We’ve had a variety of guests on the show. We’ve featured <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/we-saw-this-movie-everybody-died#details">venture capitalists</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/no-one-wants-to-spend-any-amount#details">startup founders</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/blue-checks-and-semi-fascism-wtim#details">political operatives</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-musk-bubble-in-tech-is-going#details">security experts</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/travis-kalanicks-right-hand-man-tells#details">In our most popular episode</a>, we took a look at the media’s coverage of the rise and fall of Uber CEO <strong>Travis Kalanick </strong>with the old Uber CEO’s former top deputy, <strong>Emil Michael</strong>. </p><p>Reporters, especially our reporter friends, have been a regular fixture of the show. We’ve talked with reporters like the <em>New York Times’ </em><a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blood-sport-w-erin-griffith/id1582647825?i=1000539059025"><strong>Erin Griffith</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-pumped-w-mike-isaac/id1582647825?i=1000551935670"><strong>Mike Isaac</strong></a>, the <em>Wall Street Journal’s</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/emperor-zuck#details"><strong>Deepa Seetharaman</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/adderall-on-demand-wrolfe-winkler#details"><strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong></a><strong>, </strong>and<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/bobby-koticks-call-of-duty-wkirsten#details"><strong>Kirsten Grind</strong></a>, <em>Semafor’s</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/look-on-my-monthly-uniques-ye-mighty-b62#details"><strong>Ben Smith</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/dream-of-semafornication-wreed-albergotti#details"><strong>Reed Albergotti</strong></a>, <em>Insider’s </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-end-of-quiet-quitting-waki-ito#details"><strong>Aki Ito</strong></a>, <em>Washington Post’s </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/extremely-online-w-taylor-lorenz#details"><strong>Taylor Lorenz</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and <em>Puck’s</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sbf-in-shambles-wteddy-schleifer#details"><strong>Teddy Schleifer</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Now the show — at least as we’ve come to know it — is coming to an end.</strong> </p><p>Tom is taking a job at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and he’s stepping back from his co-hosting duties. Today’s episode is our last together. The episode is a fun look back at some of the themes that we’ve explored over the past year and a half. </p><p>I’d encourage you to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cityofthetown">DM Tom on Twitter</a> with your Microsoft story ideas and tips.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Katie Benner&lt;/strong&gt;, and I became friends in San Francisco back in 2014 when we all worked as technology reporters at &lt;em&gt;The Information. &lt;/em&gt;But we didn’t achieve that core pillar of modern friendship until August 2021 when we started a podcast together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; generously let Tom co-host the podcast with me — and Katie, a reporter at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, came on every few episodes as a regular special guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago we kicked off the show with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/episode-1-interview-with-parker-conrad/id1582647825?i=1000532985626&quot;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; of Rippling CEO &lt;strong&gt;Parker Conrad&lt;/strong&gt;. Since then, publishing most Tuesdays, we’ve pumped out 69 episodes and have built up a loyal following of listeners for our niche tech media podcast. With our intense focus on how the media covers technology stories, we’ve become a must-listen for newsrooms, tech public relations shops, startup world movers and shakers, and tech industry onlookers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a variety of guests on the show. We’ve featured &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/we-saw-this-movie-everybody-died#details&quot;&gt;venture capitalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/no-one-wants-to-spend-any-amount#details&quot;&gt;startup founders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/blue-checks-and-semi-fascism-wtim#details&quot;&gt;political operatives&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-musk-bubble-in-tech-is-going#details&quot;&gt;security experts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/travis-kalanicks-right-hand-man-tells#details&quot;&gt;In our most popular episode&lt;/a&gt;, we took a look at the media’s coverage of the rise and fall of Uber CEO &lt;strong&gt;Travis Kalanick &lt;/strong&gt;with the old Uber CEO’s former top deputy, &lt;strong&gt;Emil Michael&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters, especially our reporter friends, have been a regular fixture of the show. We’ve talked with reporters like the &lt;em&gt;New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blood-sport-w-erin-griffith/id1582647825?i=1000539059025&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erin Griffith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-pumped-w-mike-isaac/id1582647825?i=1000551935670&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Isaac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/emperor-zuck#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepa Seetharaman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/adderall-on-demand-wrolfe-winkler#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolfe Winkler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/bobby-koticks-call-of-duty-wkirsten#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirsten Grind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Semafor’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/look-on-my-monthly-uniques-ye-mighty-b62#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/dream-of-semafornication-wreed-albergotti#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reed Albergotti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Insider’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-end-of-quiet-quitting-waki-ito#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aki Ito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/extremely-online-w-taylor-lorenz#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Puck’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/sbf-in-shambles-wteddy-schleifer#details&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teddy Schleifer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now the show — at least as we’ve come to know it — is coming to an end.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom is taking a job at the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and he’s stepping back from his co-hosting duties. Today’s episode is our last together. The episode is a fun look back at some of the themes that we’ve explored over the past year and a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d encourage you to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cityofthetown&quot;&gt;DM Tom on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; with your Microsoft story ideas and tips.

			<title><![CDATA[The Musk Bubble in Tech Is Going to Pop (w/Alex Stamos)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This past Thursday <strong>Elon Musk</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601062745079619584">accused</a> <strong>Alex Stamos</strong>, Facebook’s former chief security officer and the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, of running a “propaganda platform.” </p><p>That’s the sort of upside down thinking we’ve come to expect from Musk, given Stamos is one of the most fair-minded and serious thinkers about content moderation and social media platforms today. So, on Friday, we had Stamos on the <em>Dead Cat</em> podcast to talk about Musk’s choreographed leaks about the old guard at Twitter.</p><p>Last time Stamos came on the <em>Dead Cat</em> podcast, <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-medias-facebook-deflection-w-alex-stamos/id1582647825?i=1000542864355">he explained</a> why the media had underplayed its own culpability in enabling Russian disinformation while playing up Facebook’s failures. </p><p>This time, Stamos helped <em>Dead Cat</em> co-host <strong>Tom Dotan</strong> and I do our best to steel man <strong>Matt Taibbi</strong> and <strong>Bari Weiss’s</strong> purported exposés on <strong>Jack Dorsey’s</strong> Twitter, though none of us were particularly impressed by the seriousness of their reporting. </p><p>Taibbi <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394">documented</a> Twitter’s handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story. And Weiss <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601007575633305600?s=20&#38;t=Ogz_37WJfxOyVjHOwWQdFA">reported</a> on Twitter’s decision to ban Trump after the January 6 insurrection attempt. (Since we recorded on Friday, the gang has continued to pump out new iterations of the Twitter Files.)</p><p>Stamos argued that the real essence of the critique that emerged from Taibbi’s reporting was the reality that governments across the world <em>are</em> actively trying to shape social media companies’ content moderation decisions.</p><p>“Government interference on platforms is a real deal,” Stamos said.</p><p>However, Taibbi didn’t show that in his tweetstorm. Joe Biden wasn’t in office, let alone the White House, when Twitter decided to briefly censor the <em>New York Post’s </em>story about the Hunter Biden laptop. </p><p>“Musk giving very selective data to a couple of very politically biased journalists is not the kind of transparency we would need if we wanted to be confident that there was no interference on this platform by government,” Stamos said. </p><p>“The kernel of truth is that every government on the planet, including ours in the United States of America, is trying to manipulate Twitter and all of the other major platforms. And so I proposed — here are things you can do if you’re Musk: You can have an open database of moderation decisions,” Stamos said. “You can commit to releasing — instead of just releasing emails from the Biden team, the DNC, not government actors — you could release all communications from all government actors globally. So the Modi campaign, the Indian government. I think it’s really important for somebody whose net worth is tied up in China, like Musk. Communications with the Chinese Communist Party is the kind of thing that if you really cared about this, you could release. But Musk apparently doesn’t like that idea.”</p><p>On the podcast, we talked about Musk’s extreme exposure to China and Musk’s unwillingness to criticize the Chinese government. (Even as Musk has been vocally critical of the United States’ response to the pandemic, he hasn’t said anything about China’s far more restrictive Covid lockdowns.)</p><p>“Tesla has a massive giga factory in Shanghai from which they will be producing cars to be shipped around the world,” Stamos said. “China is already 25% of the revenue. Clearly, if you look at  discounted cash flows for the future, China’s going to be more than 50% of their stock price. And so yes, the [People’s Republic of China] has huge leverage over him. It’s like if Mark Zuckerberg, instead of having all his money in Facebook stock, his money was in a Chinese pharmaceutical company.”</p><p>Ultimately, Stamos predicted that the Musk fever in Silicon Valley would break. But for the time being, he said, Musk was playing the same role that Trump did at many Thanksgivings across America — dividing friends and families.</p><p>“I’m putting down a marker now. The Musk bubble in tech is going to pop,” Stamos told us. “Right now, it has become trendy to be seen as counterculture to be seen on Team Musk. And there’s a bunch of people who I used to work with, people who I’ve interacted with socially, who are smart, serious people who are now kind of waving the Musk flag. And just like with Trump. Just like with FTX. That bubble is going to pop. And you’re going to see all these people all of a sudden try to rewrite history.”</p><p>Stamos argued that Musk is unraveling before our very eyes. Tesla’s stock is down 60% this year while most of the media attention has been focused on Twitter.</p><p>“Musk is accelerating his breakdown here,” Stamos said. “If you end up with Twitter going out of business. Him having to give up Twitter to the bondholders or the debt holders. If you see him having to step down as CEO of Tesla. If you see some kind of massive moment — or you know, if there’s a horrible violent act that happens publicly. If there is, God forbid, something of the level of a Christchurch shooting or something that gets attached back to Musk’s moderation decisions — all of a sudden all these people who thought it was real cool to be on Team Musk are going to reverse themselves. And so I hope people are taking screenshots because it’s just a very scary. There’s a scary impulse in the Valley right now.”</p><p>Give it a listen</p><p>Read the automated transcript</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

So, on Friday, we had Stamos on the &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt; podcast to talk about Musk’s choreographed leaks about the old guard at Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last time Stamos came on the &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt; podcast, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-medias-facebook-deflection-w-alex-stamos/id1582647825?i=1000542864355&quot;&gt;he explained&lt;/a&gt; why the media had underplayed its own culpability in enabling Russian disinformation while playing up Facebook’s failures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, Stamos helped &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt; co-host &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan&lt;/strong&gt; and I do our best to steel man &lt;strong&gt;Matt Taibbi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bari Weiss’s&lt;/strong&gt; purported exposés on &lt;strong&gt;Jack Dorsey’s&lt;/strong&gt; Twitter, though none of us were particularly impressed by the seriousness of their reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taibbi &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; Twitter’s handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story. And Weiss &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601007575633305600?s=20&amp;#38;t=Ogz_37WJfxOyVjHOwWQdFA&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter’s decision to ban Trump after the January 6 insurrection attempt. (Since we recorded on Friday, the gang has continued to pump out new iterations of the Twitter Files.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamos argued that the real essence of the critique that emerged from Taibbi’s reporting was the reality that governments across the world &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; actively trying to shape social media companies’ content moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Government interference on platforms is a real deal,” Stamos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Taibbi didn’t show that in his tweetstorm. Joe Biden wasn’t in office, let alone the White House, when Twitter decided to briefly censor the &lt;em&gt;New York Post’s &lt;/em&gt;story about the Hunter Biden laptop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Musk giving very selective data to a couple of very politically biased journalists is not the kind of transparency we would need if we wanted to be confident that there was no interference on this platform by government,” Stamos said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kernel of truth is that every government on the planet, including ours in the United States of America, is trying to manipulate Twitter and all of the other major platforms. And so I proposed — here are things you can do if you’re Musk: You can have an open database of moderation decisions,” Stamos said. “You can commit to releasing — instead of just releasing emails from the Biden team, the DNC, not government actors — you could release all communications from all government actors globally. So the Modi campaign, the Indian government. I think it’s really important for somebody whose net worth is tied up in China, like Musk. Communications with the Chinese Communist Party is the kind of thing that if you really cared about this, you could release. But Musk apparently doesn’t like that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the podcast, we talked about Musk’s extreme exposure to China and Musk’s unwillingness to criticize the Chinese government. (Even as Musk has been vocally critical of the United States’ response to the pandemic, he hasn’t said anything about China’s far more restrictive Covid lockdowns.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tesla has a massive giga factory in Shanghai from which they will be producing cars to be shipped around the world,” Stamos said. “China is already 25% of the revenue. Clearly, if you look at  discounted cash flows for the future, China’s going to be more than 50% of their stock price. And so yes, the [People’s Republic of China] has huge leverage over him. It’s like if Mark Zuckerberg, instead of having all his money in Facebook stock, his money was in a Chinese pharmaceutical company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Stamos predicted that the Musk fever in Silicon Valley would break. But for the time being, he said, Musk was playing the same role that Trump did at many Thanksgivings across America — dividing friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m putting down a marker now. The Musk bubble in tech is going to pop,” Stamos told us. “Right now, it has become trendy to be seen as counterculture to be seen on Team Musk. And there’s a bunch of people who I used to work with, people who I’ve interacted with socially, who are smart, serious people who are now kind of waving the Musk flag. And just like with Trump. Just like with FTX. That bubble is going to pop. And you’re going to see all these people all of a sudden try to rewrite history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamos argued that Musk is unraveling before our very eyes. Tesla’s stock is down 60% this year while most of the media attention has been focused on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Musk is accelerating his breakdown here,” Stamos said. “If you end up with Twitter going out of business. Him having to give up Twitter to the bondholders or the debt holders. If you see him having to step down as CEO of Tesla. If you see some kind of massive moment — or you know, if there’s a horrible violent act that happens publicly. If there is, God forbid, something of the level of a Christchurch shooting or something that gets attached back to Musk’s moderation decisions — all of a sudden all these people who thought it was real cool to be on Team Musk are going to reverse themselves. And so I hope people are taking screenshots because it’s just a very scary. There’s a scary impulse in the Valley right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the automated transcript&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[SBF in Shambles (w/Teddy Schleifer)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the latest episode of <em>Dead Cat</em>, we examine how effective altruism’s crypto benefactor took the world — and the media and the Democratic Party, in particular — for a ride. </p><p><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong> escaped much of the skepticism that rival exchange Binance has faced — yet it’s SBF’s FTX that has filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>With the help of Puck reporter <strong>Teddy Schleifer</strong>, <em>Dead Cat </em>co-hosts <strong>Tom Dotan</strong> and I try to make sense of what exactly happened and explain the saga to the non-cryptographically inclined. </p><p>Schleifer tells us what the midterm elections will mean for tech and <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>. Dotan confesses his deficiencies as a political forecaster.</p><p>On this week’s episode of the podcast, I’m pretty open that I think the media had a blindspot for Bankman-Fried because of his effective altruism, pedigree, crypto skepticism, and Democratic politics. Yesterday, <em>Stratechery</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://stratechery.com/2022/narratives/">quoted</a> my tweets declaring as much. I assume my tweets caught the newsletter’s attention because I was willing to say something that most reporters won’t really admit publicly.</p><p>I agree with the subtext of <strong>Marc Andreessen’s</strong> latest tweets. Bankman-Fried’s performative virtue now appears to have been an obvious cover for his private transgressions. And the left was more susceptible to Bankman-Fried because it shares many of his professed values.</p><p><em>But</em> I tweeted last Tuesday and recorded the podcast on Friday — and already the narrative is moving so fast. Republicans are clearly starting to spin up the Bankman-Fried criticism as an anti-Democratic talking point. </p><p>I think it’s ridiculous to expect that the federal government should have suspected anything in particular was amiss at FTX relative to the other exchanges, when the company’s own investors didn’t seem to know anything was going on. Yes, I think that the Securities and Exchange Commission should have been more aggressive about regulating crypto broadly and not just waited for things to come undone on their own.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;On the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt;, we examine how effective altruism’s crypto benefactor took the world — and the media and the Democratic Party, in particular — for a ride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Bankman-Fried&lt;/strong&gt; escaped much of the skepticism that rival exchange Binance has faced — yet it’s SBF’s FTX that has filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Puck reporter &lt;strong&gt;Teddy Schleifer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat &lt;/em&gt;co-hosts &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan&lt;/strong&gt; and I try to make sense of what exactly happened and explain the saga to the non-cryptographically inclined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schleifer tells us what the midterm elections will mean for tech and &lt;strong&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/strong&gt;. Dotan confesses his deficiencies as a political forecaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this week’s episode of the podcast, I’m pretty open that I think the media had a blindspot for Bankman-Fried because of his effective altruism, pedigree, crypto skepticism, and Democratic politics. Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Stratechery&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2022/narratives/&quot;&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; my tweets declaring as much. I assume my tweets caught the newsletter’s attention because I was willing to say something that most reporters won’t really admit publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the subtext of &lt;strong&gt;Marc Andreessen’s&lt;/strong&gt; latest tweets. Bankman-Fried’s performative virtue now appears to have been an obvious cover for his private transgressions. And the left was more susceptible to Bankman-Fried because it shares many of his professed values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; I tweeted last Tuesday and recorded the podcast on Friday — and already the narrative is moving so fast. Republicans are clearly starting to spin up the Bankman-Fried criticism as an anti-Democratic talking point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s ridiculous to expect that the federal government should have suspected anything in particular was amiss at FTX relative to the other exchanges, when the company’s own investors didn’t seem to know anything was going on. Yes, I think that the Securities and Exchange Commission should have been more aggressive about regulating crypto broadly and not just waited for things to come undone on their own. But I don’t think Republicans were exactly cheering them on there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the media could have been more skeptical, you can’t expect reporters to ferret out every scandal (though &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/12/the-epic-collapse-of-sam-bankman-frieds-ftx-exchange-a-crypto-markets-timeline/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; certainly played a role in bringing FTX down).

			<title><![CDATA[VC Twitter Ghostwriters (w/Logan Bartlett)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Insider’s</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ghostwriter-silicon-valley-vc-venture-founder-san-francisco-2022-10">anonymous first-person account</a> of a ghostwriter for venture capitalists’ tweets captivated tech Twitter last week.

			<title><![CDATA[Cult of the Dead Cat (w/Joseph Menn)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In November 2017, with <strong>Dara Khosrowshahi</strong> a few months into his job as Uber CEO, the ride-hailing company came to me with some explosive information: The company claimed that during <strong>Travis Kalanick’s </strong>time as CEO, Uber had covered up a massive data breach. Hackers had downloaded sensitive information about Uber’s riders and drivers, and the company’s chief security officer, <strong>Joe Sullivan</strong>, had kept it under wraps by paying the hackers $100,000. Uber fired Sullivan and one of the company’s lawyers. </p><p>I published the exclusive story with the headline, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data"><em>Uber Paid Hackers to Delete Stolen Data on 57 Million People</em></a>.</p><p>Cyber security <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1567171290867597312?s=20&#38;t=NBwe82HX6Xkbwd2ABL9DHw">reporters</a> have — for years — <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/uber-hacker-payment-100000.html">raised questions</a> about the Khosrowshahi regime’s story. Sullivan tried to frame the $100,000 payout as part of the company’s white hat bug bounty program. And Sullivan’s defenders argued that Kalanick era Uber’s effort to conceal the payout — at a time when it was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over a prior data breach — looks even less anomalous today in a world where companies <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/technology/joe-sullivan-uber-security-trial-ciso.html">pay ransoms to hackers</a> all the time. </p><p>So I’ve watched the case closely over the years to see whether I’d been had. </p><p><em>Had Khosrowshahi and crew whipped up a fake scandal?</em> (I never quite understood why they would need to — Kalanick era Uber already had so many.)</p><p>Over the years, the legal system has consistently validated Khosrowshahi era Uber’s account. </p><p>* In 2018, Uber reached a $148 million settlement with 50 states and the District of Columbia over its handling of the data breach. </p><p>* In 2019, two men <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/uber-lyndacom-hacks-guilty-plea.html">pleaded guilty</a> to the Uber hack. </p><p>* In 2020, the Justice Department indicted Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor, for his handling of the hack. </p><p>* Finally, last week a jury found Sullivan guilty of both counts that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-chief-security-officer-uber-convicted-federal-charges-covering-data-breach">prosecutors brought against him</a>. (Those charges were obstruction of the Federal Trade Commission and misprision of a felony.) </p><p><em>Still</em>, parts of the cyber security world defended Sullivan’s actions.</p><p><strong>Joseph Menn</strong>, the well-respected cyber security reporter for the <em>Washington Post </em>and author of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Dead-Cow-Original-Supergroup/dp/154176238X"><em>Cult of the Dead Cow</em></a>, recently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/05/uber-obstruction-sullivan-hacking/">quoted security experts</a> raising concerns about the potential ramifications of the guilty verdict.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/05/uber-obstruction-sullivan-hacking/">Menn wrote</a>,</p><p>Most security professionals had been anticipating Sullivan’s acquittal, noting that he had kept the CEO and others who were not charged informed of what was happening.</p><p>“Personal liability for corporate decisions with executive stakeholder input is a new territory that’s somewhat uncharted for security executives,” said Dave Shackleford, owner of Voodoo Security. “I fear it will lead to a lack of interest in our field, and increased skepticism about infosec overall.”</p><p>John Johnson, a “virtual” chief information security officer for multiple companies, agreed. “Your company leadership could make choices that can have very personal repercussions to you and your lifestyle,” he said. “Not saying everything Joe did was right or perfect, but we can’t bury our head and say it will never happen to us.”</p><p>So <strong>Tom Dotan</strong> and I invited Menn onto the <em>Dead Cat</em> podcast to get his perspective on Sullivan’s conviction.

			<title><![CDATA[Dream of Semafornication (w/Reed Albergotti)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on <em>Dead Cat</em>, <strong>Reed Albergotti</strong> — the technology editor for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.semafor.com/">soon-to-be launched media</a> startup founded by <strong>Ben Smith </strong>and <strong>Justin Smith — </strong>joined the show to talk about the Biden administration’s executive orders shaping how the U.S. does business with China.<br/><br/>Albergotti reported <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://medium.com/semafor-media/semafor-exclusive-biden-will-crack-down-on-chinese-tech-with-a-new-executive-order-da466c263a8a">earlier this month</a> that the Biden administration is looking to crack down on American investors cutting checks in China. <br/><br/><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://medium.com/semafor-media/semafor-exclusive-biden-will-crack-down-on-chinese-tech-with-a-new-executive-order-da466c263a8a">He wrote</a> for <em>Semafor</em>:<br/><br/>Administration officials were <strong>particularly alarmed this March by a report in </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sequoia-capitals-china-arm-seeks-8-billion-in-new-funds-defying-tech-rout?rc=nocdws"><strong>The Information</strong></a><strong> that the Chinese arm of the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital</strong> has begun raising a new, $8 billion fund for investments in Chinese technology, according to people close to the administration. A Sequoia spokeswoman declined to comment.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>The details of the order could still change, but the administration has considered at least two ways of dealing with U.S. investments in China. One approach would be to require disclosures for any investments in semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and potentially other industries like rare earth minerals and electric cars. The other would be to set up a system that would give the government the ability to block investments outright, in the way that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can block inbound investments from China and other countries.<br/><br/>A third option being discussed by those involved is to do both.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Reed Albergotti&lt;/strong&gt; — the technology editor for the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.semafor.com/&quot;&gt;soon-to-be launched media&lt;/a&gt; startup founded by &lt;strong&gt;Ben Smith &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Justin Smith — &lt;/strong&gt;joined the show to talk about the Biden administration’s executive orders shaping how the U.S. does business with China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albergotti reported &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/semafor-media/semafor-exclusive-biden-will-crack-down-on-chinese-tech-with-a-new-executive-order-da466c263a8a&quot;&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that the Biden administration is looking to crack down on American investors cutting checks in China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/semafor-media/semafor-exclusive-biden-will-crack-down-on-chinese-tech-with-a-new-executive-order-da466c263a8a&quot;&gt;He wrote&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Semafor&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Administration officials were &lt;strong&gt;particularly alarmed this March by a report in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sequoia-capitals-china-arm-seeks-8-billion-in-new-funds-defying-tech-rout?rc=nocdws&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that the Chinese arm of the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital&lt;/strong&gt; has begun raising a new, $8 billion fund for investments in Chinese technology, according to people close to the administration. A Sequoia spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The details of the order could still change, but the administration has considered at least two ways of dealing with U.S. investments in China. One approach would be to require disclosures for any investments in semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and potentially other industries like rare earth minerals and electric cars. The other would be to set up a system that would give the government the ability to block investments outright, in the way that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can block inbound investments from China and other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third option being discussed by those involved is to do both. Biden could require disclosure and then, if something problematic arises, take further action to block it. That option is more appealing to U.S. companies and could be just as effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relatedly, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/us/politics/biden-china-tech-executive-order.html&quot;&gt;reported on another executive order&lt;/a&gt; that would expand the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to block Chinese investments in the United States.

Being a niche internet micro celebrity feels less capitalist, less ‘I’m a brand.’ ”</p><p>On this week’s <em>Dead Cat, </em>we<strong> </strong>used Lorenz’s latest story as a jumping off point to talk about the evolution of the terms “creators” and “influencers,” the rise of podcasting, and Lorenz’s various Twitter scrapes. </p><p>Lorenz is a language obsessive and is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58818667-extremely-online">writing a book</a> called <em>Extremely Online. </em>She doesn’t <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/all-rippers-and-no-skippers-how-taylor-lorenz-became-part-of-the-story?rc=iatd7y">like the name</a> for the beat most people associate her with — internet culture reporter — since she doesn’t see a sharp line separating the real world and digital life. </p><p>We covered a lot of ground in this week’s episode. We talked about Lorenz’s recent tweet dismissing Dimes Square and her online beef with <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>. </p><p>“All these billionaires are so fragile,” Lorenz told us.</p><p>“I love debating tech. I love it,” Lorenz said. “Andreessen had me on their podcast twice and didn’t release either of the episodes.”</p><p>We also discussed <em>Dead Cat </em>co-host <strong>Tom Dotan’s </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtube-became-a-podcasting-powerhouse-without-trying-2022-8">latest story</a> on YouTube’s accidental podcast ascendancy. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtube-became-a-podcasting-powerhouse-without-trying-2022-8">He wrote</a> over the weekend:</p><p>Two recent surveys, one by <a target="_blank" href="https://westwoodone.com/blog/2022/05/17/cumulus-media-and-signal-hill-insights-podcast-download-spring-2022-report-watching-podcasts-soars-as-youtube-edges-out-spotify-to-become-the-most-used-u-s-podcast-platform-and-li/">Cumulus Media</a> and one by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.insideradio.com/free/listeners-like-what-they-bought-from-podcast-ads-but-they-have-ad-complaints-too/article_be82cd46-d0fa-11ec-bc97-77abb319ae47.html">Voices</a>, showed that YouTube was the most frequently used podcasting platform, edging out Spotify and Apple's podcasting apps.</p><p>…</p><p>Last year the entire podcasting industry made $1.4 billion in ad revenue and is set to surpass $2 billion this year, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iab.com/insights/u-s-podcast-advertising-revenue-report-fy-2021-results-2022-2024-growth-projections/">according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau</a>.

Being a niche internet micro celebrity feels less capitalist, less ‘I’m a brand.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this week’s &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat, &lt;/em&gt;we&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;used Lorenz’s latest story as a jumping off point to talk about the evolution of the terms “creators” and “influencers,” the rise of podcasting, and Lorenz’s various Twitter scrapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz is a language obsessive and is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58818667-extremely-online&quot;&gt;writing a book&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Extremely Online. &lt;/em&gt;She doesn’t &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/all-rippers-and-no-skippers-how-taylor-lorenz-became-part-of-the-story?rc=iatd7y&quot;&gt;like the name&lt;/a&gt; for the beat most people associate her with — internet culture reporter — since she doesn’t see a sharp line separating the real world and digital life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We covered a lot of ground in this week’s episode. We talked about Lorenz’s recent tweet dismissing Dimes Square and her online beef with &lt;strong&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these billionaires are so fragile,” Lorenz told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love debating tech. I love it,” Lorenz said. “Andreessen had me on their podcast twice and didn’t release either of the episodes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also discussed &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat &lt;/em&gt;co-host &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtube-became-a-podcasting-powerhouse-without-trying-2022-8&quot;&gt;latest story&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube’s accidental podcast ascendancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtube-became-a-podcasting-powerhouse-without-trying-2022-8&quot;&gt;He wrote&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two recent surveys, one by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://westwoodone.com/blog/2022/05/17/cumulus-media-and-signal-hill-insights-podcast-download-spring-2022-report-watching-podcasts-soars-as-youtube-edges-out-spotify-to-become-the-most-used-u-s-podcast-platform-and-li/&quot;&gt;Cumulus Media&lt;/a&gt; and one by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.insideradio.com/free/listeners-like-what-they-bought-from-podcast-ads-but-they-have-ad-complaints-too/article_be82cd46-d0fa-11ec-bc97-77abb319ae47.html&quot;&gt;Voices&lt;/a&gt;, showed that YouTube was the most frequently used podcasting platform, edging out Spotify and Apple&apos;s podcasting apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the entire podcasting industry made $1.4 billion in ad revenue and is set to surpass $2 billion this year, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.iab.com/insights/u-s-podcast-advertising-revenue-report-fy-2021-results-2022-2024-growth-projections/&quot;&gt;according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a quickly growing industry but still a drop in the bucket compared to the $29 billion that YouTube made in ad revenue in 2021, or the $209 billion that Google ads made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So befitting the provincial, self-referential nature of the podcast industry — we talked about a tiny industry, on an insider-y podcast, with a guest who herself says she’s looking to get into the podcast game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give it a listen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the automated &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://otter.ai/u/MuQzAh0Q5IS4h1tKBrppk2l4OA4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

Stone described the acquisitions as reflecting “an almost breathtaking disregard for the trustbusters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt;, the tech podcast I co-host, this week we grapple with whether we’re comfortable with Amazon’s size, especially as the e-commerce giant saunters into our medical lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Katie Benner &lt;/strong&gt;and I are both One Medical customers — patients you might call us — so on the latest episode we debate whether we would cancel our subscriptions once One Medical is officially under new ownership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give it a listen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is definitely an episode you’re going to want to listen to. </p><p>It’s been a long time coming. </p><p>It’s a sequel of sorts to my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/above-the-crowd">interview with </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/above-the-crowd"><strong>Bill Gurley</strong></a> that ran a few months after launching this newsletter and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a-chat-with-dara-khosrowshahi">my conversation with </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a-chat-with-dara-khosrowshahi"><strong>Dara Khosrowshahi</strong></a> after that.</p><p>I finally convinced <strong>Emil Michael</strong>, a central player in the Uber saga, to give me an on-the-record interview. </p><p>Michael was once <strong>Travis Kalanick’s</strong> top lieutenant. He raised about $15 billion for Uber during his nearly four years at the company. Finally, he came on <em>Dead Cat </em>to talk to <strong>Tom Dotan</strong> and me. It’s been five years since Kalanick and Michael acrimoniously departed the company they helped build into a juggernaut. </p><p>While Michael isn’t Kalanick — who I would love to interview again someday — he was probably the second most important person at Uber during the period, understood the company and Kalanick intimately, and is a lot more willing to publicly reflect on what Uber got right and wrong than his old boss. </p><p>We covered <em>a lot</em> of ground in our hour and a half long conversation. Michael didn’t shy away from much. </p><p>Whether you’re interested in the inside baseball behind Kalanick’s ouster, or if you want to learn from Uber’s mistakes, or you just want to hear how they raised so much money, you’re going to want to give this episode a listen.</p><p>* He talked about his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/uber-groups-visit-to-seoul-escort-bar-sparked-hr-complaint">infamous visit to a shady Korean karaoke bar</a> that led former U.S. Attorney General <strong>Eric Holder</strong> to recommend Michael’s dismissal. (In my mind, probably the biggest unreported information from the Kalanick era is the Holder report itself. If anyone ever wants to leak it to me, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:eric@newcomer.co">you know where to find me</a>.)</p><p>* We discussed the latest media Uber obsession — “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/uber-files">The Uber files</a>.” <em>The Guardian </em>and other outlets reported on Uber’s influence campaign in Europe and the “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-11/uber-s-secret-tool-for-keeping-the-cops-in-the-dark">kill switch</a>.” It was a trip down memory lane that helped convince Michael to give his side of the story. Michael quipped about the “kill switch,” Uber’s tactic of locking down computers ahead of government raids: “I do think one of the bad things we did at Uber was naming things terribly.”</p><p>* Michael inveighed against Benchmark partner <strong>Bill Gurley’s</strong> crusade to push out Kalanick. But he also reminisced about how he and Gurley used to talk multiple times a day. </p><p>* Michael criticized current Uber CEO <strong>Dara Khosrowshahi’s</strong> management of the company, today worth $44.2 billion — about a third less than when Michael helped the company raise at an approximately $70 billion valuation. “When does the buck stop at Dara’s desk?” Michael asked us. But Michael also kicked himself for letting the merger with Lyft slip through his fingers. </p><p>* We talked about the media coverage of Uber past and present, what the press got right, and what it got wrong. But Michael also admitted that he’d never really figured out how to talk to the press. </p><p>* Together, we analyzed the Uber TV show, <em>Super Pumped</em>. </p><p>* Michael engaged with core questions about Uber’s existence: <em>Was the independent contractor model an inescapable original sin?

			<title><![CDATA[This Episode Wasn't Sponsored By Techmeme]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m in Italy right now for my first extended vacation of the year. I spent yesterday bopping around Siena, taking in another beautiful Duomo, eating a sandwich with lardo, and hunting for the frescoes that provided the grist for my girlfriend’s mom’s art history thesis. After stopping in Rome and Florence, my girlfriend and I are staying in rural Tuscany for a friend’s wedding and then are headed to Cinque Terre in a few days.</p><p>I’m doing my best to disconnect from the newsletter for these two weeks — though not as much as my girlfriend might like. </p><p>I left my podcast co-hosts <strong>Tom Dotan</strong> and <strong>Katie Benner </strong>to their own devices with <em>Dead Cat </em>this week. Listening to the episode, they’re clearly feeling a little more pessimistic than I am. Tom proposed for the subject line of this email, “No ideas. No joy. No money” or “the summer of despair.” Both struck me as a little too dour.</p><p>In the latest episode of <em>Dead Cat, </em>Tom and Katie take stock of some of the top stories in tech this week via <a target="_blank" href="http://techmeme.com/">Techmeme headlines</a>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-apples-eight-year-struggle-to-build-a-self-driving-car?rc=iatd7y">The implosion of Apple’s self-driving car program</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/uber-files">the Uber files</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/technology/twitter-lawsuit-musk-acquisition.html">Elon Musk’s fight with Twitter</a>. They ask why tech seems to be stuck in a rut. But mostly they seem to have a fun time, sardonically dissecting the tech world and puzzling out what the latest stock downturn means for our favorite tech storylines.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;I’m in Italy right now for my first extended vacation of the year. I spent yesterday bopping around Siena, taking in another beautiful Duomo, eating a sandwich with lardo, and hunting for the frescoes that provided the grist for my girlfriend’s mom’s art history thesis. After stopping in Rome and Florence, my girlfriend and I are staying in rural Tuscany for a friend’s wedding and then are headed to Cinque Terre in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m doing my best to disconnect from the newsletter for these two weeks — though not as much as my girlfriend might like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left my podcast co-hosts &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Katie Benner &lt;/strong&gt;to their own devices with &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat &lt;/em&gt;this week. Listening to the episode, they’re clearly feeling a little more pessimistic than I am. Tom proposed for the subject line of this email, “No ideas. No joy. No money” or “the summer of despair.” Both struck me as a little too dour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat, &lt;/em&gt;Tom and Katie take stock of some of the top stories in tech this week via &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://techmeme.com/&quot;&gt;Techmeme headlines&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-apples-eight-year-struggle-to-build-a-self-driving-car?rc=iatd7y&quot;&gt;The implosion of Apple’s self-driving car program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/uber-files&quot;&gt;the Uber files&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/technology/twitter-lawsuit-musk-acquisition.html&quot;&gt;Elon Musk’s fight with Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. They ask why tech seems to be stuck in a rut. But mostly they seem to have a fun time, sardonically dissecting the tech world and puzzling out what the latest stock downturn means for our favorite tech storylines. It’s an enjoyable listen if you’ve got some time to kill as vineyards and hay bales pass you by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discussion hinges in part on &lt;em&gt;The Information’s &lt;/em&gt;latest reporting on Apple’s self-driving car program.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb warned that e-cigarette use had become an “almost ubiquitous—and dangerous—trend among teens.” Since then, the portion of high school students vaping has dropped to 11%, and the most popular product is a newer entrant, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-20/puff-bars-disposable-vapes-exploit-us-flavor-ban-loophole&quot;&gt;Puff Bar&lt;/a&gt;, not Juul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it apparently wasn’t the company’s appeal to young people that led the agency to pull Juul off the market. A 2016 rule gave the FDA the authority to grant or deny “marketing orders” to e-cigarettes and other alternative tobacco products based on whether they met the standard of being “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” The agency found that Juul didn’t meet that standard because the company failed to provide sufficient evidence “to assess the potential toxicological risks of using the JUUL products”—even though Juul spent more than $150 million and hired an army of scientists to make its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-asks-court-to-block-fda-ban-on-its-e-cigarettes-11656076896&quot;&gt;a federal court stayed&lt;/a&gt; the FDA’s ban to give Juul time to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the automated &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://otter.ai/u/pxYqp0zEhMUWk_jZlKd81VM9zs4&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Coming to You From a Soon To Be Chesa-Free San Francisco (w/Jonathan Weber)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I moved from San Francisco to New York, in February 2019, back before it was cool to turn tail on the tech mecca. Truth be told, I’ll always have a special place in my heart for San Francisco, but my girlfriend beckoned from Brooklyn.</p><p>I’m writing this from my flight back to New York after over a week in SF. I spent much of it in an Airbnb next to Mr. Pickle’s on Van Ness Avenue and then a few days crashing at a fellow tech reporter’s apartment in the Outer Richmond. I ate Mission Chinese and La Taqueria, drank at Brass Tacks and The Monk’s Kettle, and made it up to Calistoga for a picturesque vineyard wedding.</p><p>But did I spend any time working for you, dear reader? </p><p>Yes, not to worry. I spent my days shuttling from South Park to the Presidio, catching up with venture capitalists, founders, tech media insiders, and senior tech executives. And I spent my nights getting drunk with them, eager for looser lips.</p><p>Here are my key immediate takeaways:</p><p>* One source told me that <strong>even Insight Partners — which announced a $20 billion fund in February — has decided to seriously slow down big late stage private investments</strong>. Until recently, Insight looked like one of the last holdouts when it came to doing late stage deals even as the market unraveled. But now, like pretty much everyone else, it’s mostly focused on its existing portfolio.</p><p>* <strong>VC advice on the downturn — even </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/25/sequoia-capital-slide-dek-warning-to-founders-downturn/"><strong>Sequoia Capital’s presentation to founders</strong></a><strong> — has felt too much like content marketing.</strong> For some startup CEOs it can feel a bit like you’re the goody two-shoes, “A” student in the classroom, when the teacher reprimands everyone. You think the rebuke applies to you, but really the message is meant for the troublemakers. But it’s the most diligent among us that take these admonitions personally. Founders need advice specific to their company. </p><p>* <strong>There’s a sense that there have been many software engineers who have been overpromoted</strong> in the bull cycle and that this downturn could force some coders to reset their expectations about their appropriate rank and pay.</p><p>* I spent much of my time asking sources what the overarching, thematic story of the downturn would be. One venture capitalist gave me my favorite answer: He argued that <strong>we’d look back on this downturn as a story of the perfect storm between retail and professional investor excesses</strong>. On the retail side, we saw the rise of Robinhood and Coinbase, and r/wallstreetbets trades on Kodak and GameStop. On the professional side, we saw firms like SoftBank and Tiger go so, so long without enough diligence to back it up.</p><p>* <strong>If I had to name a couple companies/firms that I think are most likely to represent this downturn, right now I’d name Instacart, Coinbase, Robinhood, GoPuff, Bird, Tesla, Tiger, and SoftBank.</strong> Though, right now, I think increasingly crypto is looking like it will be the category most associated with this cycle’s excesses.</p><p>* There’s been a lot of envy in traditional startup world of people who went over to the the crypto dark side. <strong>Now there’s all sorts of schadenfreude going on as crypto prices plummet.</strong> Some VCs are starting to admit (mostly in private) that they never really believed in crypto. Still, there’s so much money. Just as I was leaving the city, Coinbase announced that it was brutally laying off 18% of its staff, locking them out of their emails before they even had time to say goodbye.</p><p>* <strong>We’re overdue for a reckoning over who screwed over credulous investors with implausible SPAC deals.</strong> ~cough~ <strong>Chamath</strong> ~ cough ~ At least, <strong>Brad Gerstner’s </strong>Altimeter led the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-04-13/grab-spac-mega-merger-isn-t-mega-without-blackrock-pipe-kng8okt5">PIPE</a> on its own terrible Grab SPAC deal.  </p><p>* <strong>Andreessen Horowitz still remains, probably, the biggest nemesis of many firms in Silicon Valley</strong>. Sure, Tiger blew up the startup world. But what Tiger did was so unlike anything venture capital firms were doing, so there’s less professional jealousy. There are whispers that things aren’t as copacetic internally at a16z as might appear from their highly choreographed public communications. It would seem that part of the explanation for the explosion of funds at the firm has been the explosion of egos. Instead of resolving interpersonal conflicts on the consumer fund, let’s just create a gaming fund. In that light, it’s pretty amazing that the firm couldn’t figure out a way to keep <strong>Katie Haun</strong>. </p><p>* <strong>Consumer investing across the board seems challenged.</strong> What’s going on over at Popshop, Lunchclub, Cameo, and Clubhouse just to name a few? I guess investors simply <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/after-the-fallout?s=w">wishing consumer investing into being</a> without a strong new thesis wasn’t exactly an omen for the sector’s inevitable success. (I will say that Whatnot and BeReal remain two consumer plays that I’m still following.) What will it mean for this generation of consumer investors? Benchmark’s next generation consumer investor, <strong>Sarah Tavel</strong>, seems to have made her best investment in business-to-business company Chainalysis, last valued at $8.6 billion. </p><p>* <strong>Speaking of Benchmark, the firm deserves some credit for holding firm on its strategy as other venture firms’ fund sizes got crazy.</strong> Sure, Benchmark probably could have made way more money if it topped up its own investments — but then it might be taking the heat that Benchmark favorite Altimeter is getting right now over its overexuberance. There’s money <em>and</em> reputation to manage. Benchmark has always made enough money to value its reputation. (That’s something <strong>Travis Kalanick</strong>, <strong>Adam Neumann</strong>, <strong>Nirav Tolia</strong>, etc. surely gripe about.)</p><p>* <strong>Last year’s hype around venture capital firms indefinitely holding onto private companies long after they go public is looking like pure bubble thinking.</strong> Sequoia’s timing on its all-in-one, hold <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-sequoia-fund-patient-capital-for-building-enduring-companies/">indefinitely</a> “The Sequoia Capital Fund” looks a little more like one of the excesses from the bull market. But limited partners seem too afraid to do anything to unwind the strategy shift that seems designed to enrich the firm’s general partners. (<a target="_blank" href="mailto:eric@newcomer.co">Reach out to me</a> if you have off-the-record intel on this.)</p><p>* <strong>Investors are dramatically slowing the pace of their investments.</strong> These funds are going to last years longer than they would have in bull times. Multi-stage investors seem more inclined to double-down on their existing portfolio companies than to make new bets. Bridge rounds are on everyone’s lips. Still, I heard from investors who had made secret Series B and C investments in companies this year. It’s a good time to make a bet on a company that got away for a hype-y Series A round.</p><p>* Startup founders think prospective employees want assurances that their company is really worth what the company says it is. <strong>Good private unicorns are in a bit of a bind.</strong> Prospective employees are now automatically giving their equity offers a mental haircut based on the market downturn. So good companies have an incentive to reaffirm their valuations with funding rounds during the downturn — even if it otherwise might be smarter to keep their valuations artificially low so as to maintain room to grow should conditions worsen. (I wish employees would get better at assessing companies based on fundamentals, rather than the last tick fundraising round. Employees are basically begging founders to maximize for valuation, which then minimizes employee upside.)</p><p>* <strong>Some small-to-medium sized companies are shopping themselves to their rival startups</strong> but it’s not always clear why the competitor would want to buy. Why take on additional burn and headcount when all you might end up getting is leads on some new customers? Sure, you might do some venture capital firm a favor, but what’s that really worth?</p><p>* There are some cracks in up-start media world. The most obvious tremor is at <em>BuzzFeed</em> where the stock has sunk 54% in a month. Reporters have been leaving in droves. Meanwhile, <em>The Information</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BenMullin/status/1536798438859280384?s=20&#38;t=fimcA3b8tgZVtTfFvmtI3Q">lost one of its top editors</a> — <strong>Martin Peers</strong>. He’s long been a central figure over there. <em>The Information’s</em> up-and-coming venture capital reporter <strong>Berber Jin </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://talkingbiznews.com/they-talk-biz-news/wsj-hires-jin-to-cover-vc-and-startups/">departed</a> to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, as did <strong>Sarah Krouse</strong> who will be covering Netflix for the <em>Journal</em>. <strong>Stephen Nellis </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephennellis/">returned</a> to <em>Reuters</em>. Meanwhile spirits seem strong at my former employer, <em>Bloomberg. </em>The ascendance of the player-coach editor seems to have people upbeat. <strong>Sarah Frier</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>is leading big tech coverage and <strong>Lucas Shaw</strong> (who has been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/streaming-in-crisis-wlucas-shaw?s=w#details">a guest on </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/streaming-in-crisis-wlucas-shaw?s=w#details"><em>Dead Cat</em></a>) is running the show on Hollywood coverage. And somehow <em>Bloomberg</em> just <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexbarinka/status/1536387253747863552?s=20&#38;t=F_tA3yi28C9AvTHpQA-oCA">lured back</a> a former star reporter who had left to join the startup ranks: <strong>Alex Barinka</strong> — who left <em>Bloomberg </em>as a deals reporter to help launch <strong>Imran Khan’s </strong>Verishop before going over to Stitch Fix — is joining Frier’s team as a social media reporter based in LA. </p><p>* Next week I’m in Toronto for Collision where I’ll be interviewing Uncork Capital’s <strong>Andy McLoughlin</strong>, Real Ventures’ <strong>Janet Bannister, </strong>and Left Lane Capital’s <strong>Vinny Pujji</strong> on a panel Wednesday called “Survival of the leanest: The importance of being capital efficient.” Then, less than an hour later I’ll interview General Catalyst’s <strong>Hemant Taneja </strong>about responsible innovation. On Thursday, I’ll ask “Has the tech bubble burst... again?!” in a panel with FirstMark’s <strong>Matt Turck</strong>, Lux’s <strong>Deena Shakir</strong>, and Neo Financial’s <strong>Andrew Chau. </strong>Expect the most interesting tidbits in this newsletter late next week.</p><p>Talking about Chesa Boudin on Dead Cat</p><p>My first meeting in San Francisco started with a tour of <em>The</em> <em>San Francisco Standard</em>, the <strong>Michael Moritz-</strong>funded local news enterprise. My old editor <strong>Jonathan Weber</strong> — once the editor of tech media dot-com icon <em>The Industry Standard</em> — is the editor-in-chief over at the <em>SF Standard</em>. </p><p>Weber, <em>Dead Cat</em> co-host <strong>Tom Dotan,</strong> and I met up for a nice dinner at The Morris in the Mission. After spending the evening discussing San Francisco District Attorney <strong>Chesa Boudin’s </strong>recall, Tom and I convinced Weber to come on the <em>Dead Cat</em> podcast and talk about the <em>Standard </em>and San Francisco politics.</p><p>Tom thinks I’m going to get eviscerated by San Franciscans for my politics. <em>This is something we’ve never seen before: a New Yorker opining on San Francisco local affairs. </em>I did my best to offend conservatives and liberals alike, maligning the police while rooting for tech’s ascendant influence on San Francisco politics. </p><p>Weber makes the case for objective, follow-the-reporting local news and outlines the real issues underpinning the recall. He explains how money is simultaneously to blame and not to blame for Boudin’s recall. And he defends the <em>Standard</em> against its critics for its <a target="_blank" href="https://sfstandard.com/criminal-justice/da-chesa-boudin-fentanyl-court-data-drug-dealing-immigration/#:~:text=Case%20information%20The%20Standard%20obtained,case%20including%20heroin%20and%20cocaine.">influential story</a> on Boudin’s refusal to make drug arrests.

There are whispers that things aren’t as copacetic internally at a16z as might appear from their highly choreographed public communications. It would seem that part of the explanation for the explosion of funds at the firm has been the explosion of egos. Instead of resolving interpersonal conflicts on the consumer fund, let’s just create a gaming fund. In that light, it’s pretty amazing that the firm couldn’t figure out a way to keep &lt;strong&gt;Katie Haun&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Consumer investing across the board seems challenged.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s going on over at Popshop, Lunchclub, Cameo, and Clubhouse just to name a few? I guess investors simply &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/after-the-fallout?s=w&quot;&gt;wishing consumer investing into being&lt;/a&gt; without a strong new thesis wasn’t exactly an omen for the sector’s inevitable success. (I will say that Whatnot and BeReal remain two consumer plays that I’m still following.) What will it mean for this generation of consumer investors? Benchmark’s next generation consumer investor, &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Tavel&lt;/strong&gt;, seems to have made her best investment in business-to-business company Chainalysis, last valued at $8.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Speaking of Benchmark, the firm deserves some credit for holding firm on its strategy as other venture firms’ fund sizes got crazy.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, Benchmark probably could have made way more money if it topped up its own investments — but then it might be taking the heat that Benchmark favorite Altimeter is getting right now over its overexuberance. There’s money &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reputation to manage. Benchmark has always made enough money to value its reputation. (That’s something &lt;strong&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Adam Neumann&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nirav Tolia&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. surely gripe about.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Last year’s hype around venture capital firms indefinitely holding onto private companies long after they go public is looking like pure bubble thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Sequoia’s timing on its all-in-one, hold &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-sequoia-fund-patient-capital-for-building-enduring-companies/&quot;&gt;indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; “The Sequoia Capital Fund” looks a little more like one of the excesses from the bull market. But limited partners seem too afraid to do anything to unwind the strategy shift that seems designed to enrich the firm’s general partners. (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:eric@newcomer.co&quot;&gt;Reach out to me&lt;/a&gt; if you have off-the-record intel on this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Investors are dramatically slowing the pace of their investments.&lt;/strong&gt; These funds are going to last years longer than they would have in bull times. Multi-stage investors seem more inclined to double-down on their existing portfolio companies than to make new bets. Bridge rounds are on everyone’s lips. Still, I heard from investors who had made secret Series B and C investments in companies this year. It’s a good time to make a bet on a company that got away for a hype-y Series A round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Startup founders think prospective employees want assurances that their company is really worth what the company says it is. &lt;strong&gt;Good private unicorns are in a bit of a bind.&lt;/strong&gt; Prospective employees are now automatically giving their equity offers a mental haircut based on the market downturn. So good companies have an incentive to reaffirm their valuations with funding rounds during the downturn — even if it otherwise might be smarter to keep their valuations artificially low so as to maintain room to grow should conditions worsen. (I wish employees would get better at assessing companies based on fundamentals, rather than the last tick fundraising round. Employees are basically begging founders to maximize for valuation, which then minimizes employee upside.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Some small-to-medium sized companies are shopping themselves to their rival startups&lt;/strong&gt; but it’s not always clear why the competitor would want to buy. Why take on additional burn and headcount when all you might end up getting is leads on some new customers? Sure, you might do some venture capital firm a favor, but what’s that really worth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* There are some cracks in up-start media world. The most obvious tremor is at &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; where the stock has sunk 54% in a month. Reporters have been leaving in droves. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BenMullin/status/1536798438859280384?s=20&amp;#38;t=fimcA3b8tgZVtTfFvmtI3Q&quot;&gt;lost one of its top editors&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;Martin Peers&lt;/strong&gt;. He’s long been a central figure over there. &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; up-and-coming venture capital reporter &lt;strong&gt;Berber Jin &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://talkingbiznews.com/they-talk-biz-news/wsj-hires-jin-to-cover-vc-and-startups/&quot;&gt;departed&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, as did &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Krouse&lt;/strong&gt; who will be covering Netflix for the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Nellis &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephennellis/&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile spirits seem strong at my former employer, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg. &lt;/em&gt;The ascendance of the player-coach editor seems to have people upbeat. &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Frier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is leading big tech coverage and &lt;strong&gt;Lucas Shaw&lt;/strong&gt; (who has been &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/streaming-in-crisis-wlucas-shaw?s=w#details&quot;&gt;a guest on &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/streaming-in-crisis-wlucas-shaw?s=w#details&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is running the show on Hollywood coverage. And somehow &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; just &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexbarinka/status/1536387253747863552?s=20&amp;#38;t=F_tA3yi28C9AvTHpQA-oCA&quot;&gt;lured back&lt;/a&gt; a former star reporter who had left to join the startup ranks: &lt;strong&gt;Alex Barinka&lt;/strong&gt; — who left &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;as a deals reporter to help launch &lt;strong&gt;Imran Khan’s &lt;/strong&gt;Verishop before going over to Stitch Fix — is joining Frier’s team as a social media reporter based in LA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Next week I’m in Toronto for Collision where I’ll be interviewing Uncork Capital’s &lt;strong&gt;Andy McLoughlin&lt;/strong&gt;, Real Ventures’ &lt;strong&gt;Janet Bannister, &lt;/strong&gt;and Left Lane Capital’s &lt;strong&gt;Vinny Pujji&lt;/strong&gt; on a panel Wednesday called “Survival of the leanest: The importance of being capital efficient.” Then, less than an hour later I’ll interview General Catalyst’s &lt;strong&gt;Hemant Taneja &lt;/strong&gt;about responsible innovation. On Thursday, I’ll ask “Has the tech bubble burst... again?!” in a panel with FirstMark’s &lt;strong&gt;Matt Turck&lt;/strong&gt;, Lux’s &lt;strong&gt;Deena Shakir&lt;/strong&gt;, and Neo Financial’s &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Chau. &lt;/strong&gt;Expect the most interesting tidbits in this newsletter late next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about Chesa Boudin on Dead Cat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first meeting in San Francisco started with a tour of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Standard&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Michael Moritz-&lt;/strong&gt;funded local news enterprise. My old editor &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Weber&lt;/strong&gt; — once the editor of tech media dot-com icon &lt;em&gt;The Industry Standard&lt;/em&gt; — is the editor-in-chief over at the &lt;em&gt;SF Standard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weber, &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt; co-host &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan,&lt;/strong&gt; and I met up for a nice dinner at The Morris in the Mission. After spending the evening discussing San Francisco District Attorney &lt;strong&gt;Chesa Boudin’s &lt;/strong&gt;recall, Tom and I convinced Weber to come on the &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat&lt;/em&gt; podcast and talk about the &lt;em&gt;Standard &lt;/em&gt;and San Francisco politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom thinks I’m going to get eviscerated by San Franciscans for my politics. &lt;em&gt;This is something we’ve never seen before: a New Yorker opining on San Francisco local affairs. &lt;/em&gt;I did my best to offend conservatives and liberals alike, maligning the police while rooting for tech’s ascendant influence on San Francisco politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weber makes the case for objective, follow-the-reporting local news and outlines the real issues underpinning the recall. He explains how money is simultaneously to blame and not to blame for Boudin’s recall. And he defends the &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt; against its critics for its &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://sfstandard.com/criminal-justice/da-chesa-boudin-fentanyl-court-data-drug-dealing-immigration/#:~:text=Case%20information%20The%20Standard%20obtained,case%20including%20heroin%20and%20cocaine.&quot;&gt;influential story&lt;/a&gt; on Boudin’s refusal to make drug arrests. We interrogate what Boudin’s defeat means for the future of progressive politics and the city of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the automated &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://otter.ai/u/EaWWnu2B4gryDyxIh8DOp0Us9eI&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[State of Substack (w/Casey Newton)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the many joys of going independent and writing on Substack is that I work at the eye of a trend piece. There’s a storm circling around me with fights about Substack’s politics and its promise as a media disruptor. But at the center of that vortex, I’m far more focused on my own business than the broader maelstrom around me. I’m very fortunate to say that my paid subscriber count has now grown beyond 1,500 and more than 22,000 people now receive my free emails. I’ve been enjoying a steeper growth curve lately.</p><p>This week on the <em>Dead Cat </em>podcast, <strong>Katie Benner</strong>, <strong>Tom Dotan</strong>, and I talk to technology Substack writer <strong>Casey Newton</strong>. On the podcast, I reminisce about how I phoned Newton during the depths of the pandemic to tell him that I was going to leave <em>Bloomberg</em> to start a Substack only to learn he was about to launch one as well. Newton founded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.platformer.news/"><em>Platformer</em></a>, a go-to destination for news and analysis about what’s happening in the technology industry — especially at social media companies.

Most weeks, I try to save something for paying subscribers. That can mean putting a paywall halfway down an article — like saving exclusive financial information for paying subscribers — or putting entire pieces behind the paywall. </p><p>Types of Newcomer Posts</p><p>* <strong>In-depth profiles of Silicon Valley main characters based on a probing interview</strong>. Think: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/elad-gil-wants-you-to-live-longer?s=w"><em>Elad Gil Wants You To Live Longer</em></a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/general-catalysts-secret-ceo?s=w"><em>General Catalyst's Secret CEO</em></a><em> </em>or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/above-the-crowd?s=w"><em>Above the Crowd</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>* <strong>Sweeping, deeply-reported narratives about a venture capital firm</strong>. Probably my most iconic piece remains, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-unauthorized-story-of-andreessen?s=w"><em>The Unauthorized Story of Andreessen Horowitz</em></a><em>. </em>And Andreessen Horowitz has been perhaps the main character of this newsletter with pieces like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/when-will-a16z-become-a-public-market?s=w"><em>When Will a16z Become a Public Market Investor?</em></a><em> </em>I’d put my profile of Bessemer Venture Partners — <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-anti-portfolio?s=w"><em>The Anti-Portfolio</em></a><em> — </em>in this bucket. I’ve also been covering Y Combinator closely with my interview of YC President <strong>Geoff Ralston </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/y-combinator-growth?s=w"><em>YC = Growth</em></a><em>, </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/what-insiders-think-about-ycs-new?s=w"><em>What Insiders Think About YC's New Deal Terms</em></a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/ali-partovi-wants-to-beat-the-old?s=w"><em>Ali Partovi Wants to Beat the Old YC</em></a>.</p><p>* <strong>Stories about top investment firms based on their private fundraising materials</strong>. Recently, I published a look at Tiger Global with some of the firm’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/tiger-global-and-softbank-bet-the?s=w">private fundraising decks</a>. (I added a few more slides after publishing the article by the way if you haven’t returned to it since.) Fans of that piece should also check out my article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/inside-3-crypto-funds-investor-decks?s=w"><em>Inside 3 Crypto Funds' Investor Decks</em></a><em>. </em>I’ve gotten my hands on another pitch deck so I should have another similar piece out in the coming days.</p><p>* <strong>Market trend pieces</strong>. Recent examples: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/heres-what-investors-think-the-treacherous?s=w"><em>Here’s What Investors Think the Treacherous Public Markets Mean for Private Startups</em></a><em> </em>or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/good-times-in-the-great-revaluation?s=w"><em>Good Times in The Great Revaluation</em></a><em>. </em>These pieces rely on my building up a depth of information about a particular sector before dropping it in a single post.</p><p>* <strong>Story of a Cap Table articles</strong>. These are fun and instructive venture capital case studies. They’re always popular. An example from late last year: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-story-of-a-cap-table-gitlab?s=w"><em>The Story of a Cap Table: GitLab</em></a><em>. </em>The challenge with these pieces is that they require interesting companies to file to go public — and cooperative sources at a regulatorily-paranoid time in a company’s lifetime. Given the slow IPO pipeline, there’s been a slowdown in cap table stories.</p><p>* <strong>Weekend reading posts</strong>. It’s a fun way to concisely hit a bunch of different topics at once. But, truth be told, I’m always ambivalent about them. If you know me, then you know I feel guilty whenever I’m not breaking news or bringing exclusive access to a piece. But I think the reality is that I spend a unhealthy amount of time reading tech news and many readers are happy to get a rundown of what I think matters. I’m always trying to think of new ways to level these pieces up.</p><p>* <strong>Scoops</strong>. I’m addicted to scoops. I live for the adrenaline. Definitely, my scoop on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-opensea-eyes-13-billion-valuation?s=w">OpenSea’s funding round</a> was important for the newsletter. I made that piece a broader look at <strong>Katie Haun</strong> and Andreessen Horowitz. If it’s getting toward the end of the week and I haven’t published anything yet, I’m probably scrambling for a scoop. It’s a great time to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:eric@newcomer.co">send me a tip</a>.</p><p>* <strong>There are other long-form pieces that don’t fit neatly into these categories.</strong> I wrote a case against<a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a-horseman-of-the-apocalypse?s=w"> Rivian</a>. I’m still really proud of my<a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue?s=w"> investigation into Palantir’s SPAC investments</a>. I should write a follow-up piece on how many of those investments have gone terribly.</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;One of the many joys of going independent and writing on Substack is that I work at the eye of a trend piece. There’s a storm circling around me with fights about Substack’s politics and its promise as a media disruptor. But at the center of that vortex, I’m far more focused on my own business than the broader maelstrom around me. I’m very fortunate to say that my paid subscriber count has now grown beyond 1,500 and more than 22,000 people now receive my free emails. I’ve been enjoying a steeper growth curve lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week on the &lt;em&gt;Dead Cat &lt;/em&gt;podcast, &lt;strong&gt;Katie Benner&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tom Dotan&lt;/strong&gt;, and I talk to technology Substack writer &lt;strong&gt;Casey Newton&lt;/strong&gt;.

It’s a fun way to concisely hit a bunch of different topics at once. But, truth be told, I’m always ambivalent about them. If you know me, then you know I feel guilty whenever I’m not breaking news or bringing exclusive access to a piece. But I think the reality is that I spend a unhealthy amount of time reading tech news and many readers are happy to get a rundown of what I think matters. I’m always trying to think of new ways to level these pieces up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Scoops&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m addicted to scoops. I live for the adrenaline. Definitely, my scoop on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-opensea-eyes-13-billion-valuation?s=w&quot;&gt;OpenSea’s funding round&lt;/a&gt; was important for the newsletter. I made that piece a broader look at &lt;strong&gt;Katie Haun&lt;/strong&gt; and Andreessen Horowitz. If it’s getting toward the end of the week and I haven’t published anything yet, I’m probably scrambling for a scoop. It’s a great time to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:eric@newcomer.co&quot;&gt;send me a tip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;There are other long-form pieces that don’t fit neatly into these categories.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote a case against&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/a-horseman-of-the-apocalypse?s=w&quot;&gt; Rivian&lt;/a&gt;. I’m still really proud of my&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue?s=w&quot;&gt; investigation into Palantir’s SPAC investments&lt;/a&gt;. I should write a follow-up piece on how many of those investments have gone terribly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[The Fictionalized Viral Uber Driver]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>On the Dead Cat podcast, </em><strong><em>Tom Dotan</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>Katie Benner</em></strong><em>, and I talk about Apple’s WeCrashed, Hulu’s The Dropout, and SHOWTIME’s Super Pumped — the TV shows about </em><strong><em>Adam Neumann</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>Elizabeth Holmes</em></strong><em>, and </em><strong><em>Travis Kalanick </em></strong><em>respectively. (Spoilers: If you believe that real events that have already transpired can be spoiled.)</em></p><p>This morning, I emailed <strong>Fawzi Kamel</strong>, the Uber driver whose confrontation with then-Uber CEO <strong>Travis Kalanick</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/in-video-uber-ceo-argues-with-driver-over-falling-fares">went viral</a> when I published it at <em>Bloomberg</em>. </p><p>The video captures Kalanick — at the peak of the scrutiny around his leadership — telling Kamel, “Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s**t. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!”</p><p>I wanted to catch up with Kamel to see if he had seen himself on TV. </p><p>He’s a character in the SHOWTIME television series Super Pumped, played by actor <strong>Mousa Hussein Kraish.</strong></p><p>Kamel called me back: He hadn’t watched the show. </p><p>The fictional version of Kamel gets rid of his car, consults with a lawyer and his wife, and then posts the video online. </p><p>The real world Fawzi Kamel was far bolder.</p><p>Kamel was still driving for Uber when he sent me an email with the subject line “About uber.” He wrote me from his iPhone on Feb. 22, 2017: </p><p>I started driving for uber in 2011So I know the company from the beginning and I can introduce you to drivers who started in 2010 under Ryan grave . We all know the dirty uber thief .Last Sunday , I picked up Travis and I told him that non of the drivers trust him  anymore . Cause he  cheated the drivers who promoted his  idea at the beginning and made him  who he  is  todayHe got mad and slammed my car doorThe point I'm trying to make is the answer of uber CEO after I told him that I Bankrupt because of him  .

(Spoilers: If you believe that real events that have already transpired can be spoiled.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, I emailed &lt;strong&gt;Fawzi Kamel&lt;/strong&gt;, the Uber driver whose confrontation with then-Uber CEO &lt;strong&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/in-video-uber-ceo-argues-with-driver-over-falling-fares&quot;&gt;went viral&lt;/a&gt; when I published it at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video captures Kalanick — at the peak of the scrutiny around his leadership — telling Kamel, “Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s**t. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to catch up with Kamel to see if he had seen himself on TV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s a character in the SHOWTIME television series Super Pumped, played by actor &lt;strong&gt;Mousa Hussein Kraish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamel called me back: He hadn’t watched the show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fictional version of Kamel gets rid of his car, consults with a lawyer and his wife, and then posts the video online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real world Fawzi Kamel was far bolder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamel was still driving for Uber when he sent me an email with the subject line “About uber.” He wrote me from his iPhone on Feb. 22, 2017: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started driving for uber in 2011So I know the company from the beginning and I can introduce you to drivers who started in 2010 under Ryan grave . We all know the dirty uber thief .Last Sunday , I picked up Travis and I told him that non of the drivers trust him  anymore .

			<title><![CDATA[Brands Are Not Human Beings (w/Jack Conte)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Patreon CEO <strong>Jack Conte </strong>took the stage at my first ever SXSW event with a beer in hand. </p><p>With <em>Dead Cat </em>co-host <strong>Tom Dotan, </strong>we discussed crowdfunding, OnlyFans, Substack, NFTs, Ukraine, and whether creators are brands.</p><p>Speaking from the stage at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.volleythat.com/">Volley</a> Game Room at SXSW, Conte explained why his company wouldn’t compete with the likes of Twitter and YouTube to build audiences for the creators that it works with. “Patreon set out to solve a very specific problem. The specific problem we were solving was, there are creators who are getting millions of views, creators who have incredible reach, but they’re being undervalued by society,” Conte said. </p><p>Conte said that he didn’t think Patreon could compete directly with large social media companies. “I actually don’t know that that’s a war that we would win. Those businesses are solid businesses. They have moats. They have network effects that make it very difficult to break into those worlds. I think Patreon’s best bet at solving this problem of creator payments is focusing very specifically on the problem of creator payments.”</p><p>Conte seemed to be interested in exploring NFTs but was reticent to say that the company was specifically considering embracing them after receiving backlash on another podcast for even asking a question about NFTs.</p><p>Toward the end of our conversation, Conte disagreed with journalist <strong>Taylor Lorenz’s</strong> stance that reporters should worry about their brands. Conte objected to the idea that creators of any sort should be thinking too much about their “brand.”</p><p>For context, earlier this month, <em>Insider </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-reporters-frustrated-over-outside-work-policies-2022-3">quoted Lorenz</a> in a much-discussed article.</p><p>“When you think about the future of media, it’s much more distributed and about personalities," said Taylor Lorenz, a former Times tech reporter who recently left for The Washington Post. “Younger people recognize the power of having their own brand and audience, and the longer you stay at a job that restricts you from outside opportunities, the less relevant your brand becomes.”</p><p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GregJaffe/status/1499378741751033863?s=20&#38;t=KW3tAotLeSPHsD1gSR-p2Q">bunch</a> of political reporters — including the <em>New York Times’</em> <strong>Maggie Haberman </strong>and Washington Post reporter <strong>Jacqueline Alemany</strong> — seized on Lorenz’s comments to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1499450934111449090?s=20&#38;t=KW3tAotLeSPHsD1gSR-p2Q">take issue</a> with the notion that journalists should shape their “brand.”</p><p>Conte seemed to agree with Lorenz that journalists can increasingly operate independently of newsrooms, but he took issue with the idea that journalists should mind their brands.</p><p>“Can journalists develop independent followings?” Conte asked rhetorically. </p><p>“Of course they can.” </p><p>“Do journalists need to be a part of larger institutions and leverage those institution’s historical reach?”</p><p>“No, obviously, that is changing.” </p><p>“But the more interesting part of what you just said is the distinguishing characteristics between this concept of a brand and the concept of a creator,” Conte said.</p><p>“What I would argue is that those are very f*****g different things. Very different.” </p><p>“A brand is consistent. It has brand values. It builds trust. It has decks of like its style and its voice and what it sounds like. And if it were a person, what kind of jeans would it wear?”</p><p>“Like that’s what brands are.”</p><p>“Brands are not human beings,” he continued. “They’re not.”</p><p>“Creators are f*****g people. They’re inconsistent. They’re human. They're beautiful. They’re frail. They’re smart. They’re stupid. They’re strategic. They’re impulsive. They’re human beings.” </p><p>Conte said, “We’re all trying to behave like brands today. And brands are corporations. Like we don’t have to behave like brands.”</p><p>“When you watch a Prince music video — that f*****g guy is just himself, no matter what. And I don’t want him to behave like Walmart. I want him to be Prince. And my favorite creators, I want them to be themselves and I want them to feel human and I want them to not feel trapped by their brand values. I think it’s a mistake for everybody to think, ‘I need a personal brand. I need to create a brand.’” </p><p>“Just be yourself.”</p><p>Next week, look forward to VC Jeopardy with Deena Shakir, Julian Eison, Charles Hudson, and Steve Brotman.</p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Newcomer at <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">www.newcomer.co/subscribe</a>

I think Patreon’s best bet at solving this problem of creator payments is focusing very specifically on the problem of creator payments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conte seemed to be interested in exploring NFTs but was reticent to say that the company was specifically considering embracing them after receiving backlash on another podcast for even asking a question about NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of our conversation, Conte disagreed with journalist &lt;strong&gt;Taylor Lorenz’s&lt;/strong&gt; stance that reporters should worry about their brands. Conte objected to the idea that creators of any sort should be thinking too much about their “brand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-reporters-frustrated-over-outside-work-policies-2022-3&quot;&gt;quoted Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; in a much-discussed article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you think about the future of media, it’s much more distributed and about personalities,&quot; said Taylor Lorenz, a former Times tech reporter who recently left for The Washington Post. “Younger people recognize the power of having their own brand and audience, and the longer you stay at a job that restricts you from outside opportunities, the less relevant your brand becomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GregJaffe/status/1499378741751033863?s=20&amp;#38;t=KW3tAotLeSPHsD1gSR-p2Q&quot;&gt;bunch&lt;/a&gt; of political reporters — including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Maggie Haberman &lt;/strong&gt;and Washington Post reporter &lt;strong&gt;Jacqueline Alemany&lt;/strong&gt; — seized on Lorenz’s comments to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1499450934111449090?s=20&amp;#38;t=KW3tAotLeSPHsD1gSR-p2Q&quot;&gt;take issue&lt;/a&gt; with the notion that journalists should shape their “brand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conte seemed to agree with Lorenz that journalists can increasingly operate independently of newsrooms, but he took issue with the idea that journalists should mind their brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can journalists develop independent followings?” Conte asked rhetorically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course they can.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do journalists need to be a part of larger institutions and leverage those institution’s historical reach?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, obviously, that is changing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the more interesting part of what you just said is the distinguishing characteristics between this concept of a brand and the concept of a creator,” Conte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I would argue is that those are very f*****g different things. Very different.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A brand is consistent. It has brand values. It builds trust. It has decks of like its style and its voice and what it sounds like. And if it were a person, what kind of jeans would it wear?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like that’s what brands are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brands are not human beings,” he continued. “They’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creators are f*****g people. They’re inconsistent. They’re human. They&apos;re beautiful. They’re frail. They’re smart. They’re stupid. They’re strategic. They’re impulsive. They’re human beings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conte said, “We’re all trying to behave like brands today. And brands are corporations. Like we don’t have to behave like brands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you watch a Prince music video — that f*****g guy is just himself, no matter what. And I don’t want him to behave like Walmart. I want him to be Prince. And my favorite creators, I want them to be themselves and I want them to feel human and I want them to not feel trapped by their brand values. I think it’s a mistake for everybody to think, ‘I need a personal brand. I need to create a brand.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just be yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week, look forward to VC Jeopardy with Deena Shakir, Julian Eison, Charles Hudson, and Steve Brotman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

Isaac gave us a preview of the questions he’s asking going into his in-the-works book on Facebook — &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://deadline.com/2022/02/super-pumped-renewed-season-2-at-showtime-anthology-series-facebook-1234933600/&quot;&gt;which is already slated to become the sequel to the Uber series&lt;/a&gt;. And we concluded our conversation with a brief discussion of Isaac and his colleagues’ &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/arts/music/spotify-joe-rogan-misinformation.html&quot;&gt;latest reporting on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, which revealed that Spotify had committed to paying &lt;strong&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/strong&gt; a stunning $200 million-plus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get full access to Newcomer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newcomer.co/subscribe?utm_medium=podcast&amp;#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4&quot;&gt;www.newcomer.co/subscribe&lt;/a&gt;

It would represent a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-clubhouse-poster-child-pandemic-hype-2021-11">peak moment of cultural relevance for Clubhouse</a>. </p><p>* In March, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9949a88-6c09-4de5-92e7-73994bb2b62f">Stripe’s valuation climbed to $95 billion</a>. (And we talked about <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29387264">Stripe’s critics</a> on Y Combinator-owned Hacker News and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/stripe-hiring-issues-rescinded-jobs">coverage of Stripe’s hiring practices in </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/stripe-hiring-issues-rescinded-jobs"><em>Protocol</em></a>.) </p><p>* In May, <strong>Antonio García Martínez </strong>declared that Apple had <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/1393335892782190592?s=20">fired him</a> over the culture war backlash to his book <em>Chaos Monkeys</em>. </p><p>* In June, the <em>New York Times</em> wrote about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html">tough working conditions at Amazon</a>. Later this year, a tornado would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/business/dealbook/amazon-warehouse-tornado.html">rip through an Amazon </a>facility, killing six and raising further questions about how Amazon protects its workers. </p><p>* Also in June, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/andreessen-horowitz-and-the-future">Andreessen Horowitz launched its much-discussed </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/andreessen-horowitz-and-the-future"><em>Future</em></a><em> — </em>a publication that hasn’t yet taken Silicon Valley by storm but has put every venture firm on notice that they need to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/redpoint-ventures-is-launching-a-media-operation-and-embracing-tiktok?rc=uyj46y">think about getting in the content business</a>. </p><p>* We talked about Robinhood’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/robinhood-hood-ipo-stock-starts-trading-on-the-nasdaq.html">IPO in July</a> and the rise of meme stocks. </p><p>* And we discussed how big tech executives don’t seem to want <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/technology/dorsey-twitter-big-tech-ceos.html">to worry about the present</a>. <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/05/1013166252/jeff-bezos-built-amazon-27-years-ago-he-now-steps-down-as-ceo-at-critical-time#:~:text=John%20Locher%2FAP-,Jeff%20Bezos%20stepped%20down%20on%20as%20CEO%20of%20Amazon%20on,his%20longtime%20deputy%20Andy%20Jassy.&#38;text=Jeff%20Bezos%20stepped%20down%20as,garage%20in%20West%20Bellevue%2C%20Wash.">stepped down</a> as Amazon CEO in July as he spends more time on Blue Origin; Facebook CEO <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> rebranded his <a target="_blank" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">company to Meta in October</a>; and <strong>Jack Dorsey </strong>left behind moderation challenges at Twitter in late November and then renamed his financial services company Square to Block, hoping to emphasize the company’s crypto ambitions. </p><p>Finally, Tom, Katie, and Eric offer some predictions for what 2022 holds, though no one seems quite sure after this strange year.</p><p>Techmeme!</p><p>My favorite tech headline aggregator, tweet tracker, and conversation setter — <a target="_blank" href="https://techmeme.com/?from=newcomer">Techmeme</a> — has been generously featuring me on their home page as part of a round-up of interesting tech newsletters.

			<title><![CDATA[The Media's Facebook Deflection (w/Alex Stamos)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We talked to former Facebook Chief Security Officer <strong>Alex Stamos</strong> about what the media got right and wrong about its coverage of Facebook’s influence on the 2016 election. Stamos — who played a key role in bringing information to <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> about Russian election interference — is someone who is willing to criticize his former employer without letting the media off the hook. </p><p>Stamos argues that Facebook inadequately addressed misinformation posted onto Facebook’s platform and downplayed its discovery of Russian election interference on its platform. BUT, Stamos argues that the media played a far larger role in helping Russian election interference by gleefully publishing stolen Democratic National Committee emails. </p><p>We decided to check in with Stamos as the credibility of the Steele dossier has continued to unravel. </p><p>We talk about the media’s failure to soul search over its own role in the hacked election. We also discuss <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">the Facebook Files</a> and Stamos’ objections to some of the latest reporting on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Background reading:</strong> </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/08/steele-dossier-msnbc-cnn-danchenko-durham/"><em>Opinion: Indictment of Steele dossier source is more bad news for multiple media outlets</em></a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/opinion/steele-dossier.html"><em>How Did So Much of the Media Get the Steele Dossier So Wrong?</em></a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/collusion-who-needs-it-when-facebook-was-allowing-russians-to-help-trump/2017/10/31/38e196e6-be43-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html"><em>Collusion?

We also discuss &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739&quot;&gt;the Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt; and Stamos’ objections to some of the latest reporting on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background reading:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/08/steele-dossier-msnbc-cnn-danchenko-durham/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinion: Indictment of Steele dossier source is more bad news for multiple media outlets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/opinion/steele-dossier.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Did So Much of the Media Get the Steele Dossier So Wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/collusion-who-needs-it-when-facebook-was-allowing-russians-to-help-trump/2017/10/31/38e196e6-be43-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collusion?
