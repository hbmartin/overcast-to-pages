			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Gabriel Petrescu, an organizational network analyst, discusses how network science can provide deep insights into organizational structures using OrgXO, a tool that maps companies as networks rather than rigid hierarchies. Listeners will learn how analyzing workplace collaboration networks can reveal hidden influencers, organizational bottlenecks, and engagement levels, offering a data-driven approach to improving effectiveness and resilience.</p> <p>Key insights include how companies can identify overburdened employees, address silos between departments, and detect vulnerabilities where too few individuals hold critical knowledge. Real-life applications range from mergers and acquisitions, where network analysis helps assess company dynamics before an acquisition, to restructuring efforts that improve workflow and team collaboration.</p> <p>Gabriel’s work highlights how organizations can shift from traditional hierarchical thinking to a network-based perspective, leading to smarter decision-making and more adaptable companies.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest in this episode is David Tench, a Grace Hopper postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, who specializes in scalable graph algorithms and compression techniques to tackle massive datasets.</p> <p><br /> In this episode, we will learn how his techniques enable real-time analysis of large datasets, such as particle tracking in physics experiments or social network analysis, by reducing storage requirements while preserving critical structural properties.</p> <p>David also challenges the common belief that giant graphs are sparse by pointing to a potential bias: Maybe because of the challenges that exist in analyzing large dense graphs, we only see datasets of sparse graphs?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our guest in this episode is David Tench, a Grace Hopper postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, who specializes in scalable graph algorithms and compression techniques to tackle massive datasets.</p> <p> In this episode, we will learn how his techniques enable real-time analysis of large datasets, such as particle tracking in physics experiments or social network analysis, by reducing storage requirements while preserving critical structural properties.</p> <p>David also challenges the common belief that giant graphs are sparse by pointing to a potential bias: Maybe because of the challenges that exist in analyzing large dense graphs, we only see datasets of sparse graphs?

This means that if two developers contributed to the same project, an edge (connection) was formed between them, representing a collaborative relationship network consisting of 32 million such connections.<br /> By using algorithms for Community Detection, Behnaz's analysis reveals insights into how developer communities form, function, and evolve, that can be used as guidance for OSS community managers.</p>]]></description>

While biodiversity modeling may sound simple, count organisms and mark their location, there is a lot more to it than that! Incomplete and biased data can make estimations hard. There are also many species with very few observations in the wild. Using machine learning and remote sensing data, scientists can build models that predict species distributions with limited data. Listen in and hear about Hager’s work tackling these challenges and the tools she has built.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Ashay Aswale and Tony Lopez shared their work on swarm robotics and what they have learned from ants. Robotic swarms must solve the same problems that eusocial insects do. What if your pheromone trail goes cold? What if you’re getting bad information from a bad-actor within the swarm? Answering these questions can help tackle serious robotic challenges. For example, a swarm of robots can lose a few members to accidents and malfunctions, but a large robot cannot. Additionally, a swarm could be host to many castes like an ant colony. Specialization with redundancy built in seems like a win-win! Tune in and hear more about this fascinating topic.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), now get ready for Animal Computer Interaction (ACI). Ilyena has made a career developing computer interfaces for non-human animals. She has worked with dogs, parrots, primates, and even giraffes. This is challenging because animals have a wide range of abilities and preferences. Parrots, for example, use their tongues to make selections on touchscreens. Listen in on our conversation and learn about interface development and testing with animals and how technology may improve animal welfare. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Taylor shares his research on magnetoreception. Animals like birds and sea turtles use magnetoreception to use the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation, but it’s not a sense that’s well understood. Brian uses animal magnetoreception to engineer new ways to navigate the globe. Even cooler, he also takes hypotheses for how magnetoreception works in animals and uses computational simulations to digitally test them. Check out this episode to hear more about Brian’s research and learn more about this little known sensory ability. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Data scientists and psychics have at least one major thing in common. Both professions attempt to predict the future. In the case of a data scientist, this is done using algorithms, data, and often comes with some measure of quality such as a confidence interval or estimated accuracy. In contrast, psychics rely on their intuition or an appeal to the supernatural as the source for their predictions. Still, in the interest of empirical evidence, the quality of predictions made by psychics can be put to the test.</p> <p>The Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project seeks to do exactly that. It's the longest known project tracking annual predictions made by psychics, and the accuracy of those predictions in hindsight. Richard Saunders, host of The Skeptic Zone Podcast, joins us to share the results of this decadal study.</p> <p>Read the full report: <a href= "https://www.skeptics.com.au/2021/12/09/psychic-project-full-results-released/">https://www.skeptics.com.au/2021/12/09/psychic-project-full-results-released/</a></p> <p>And follow the Skeptics Zone: <a href= "https://www.skepticzone.tv/">https://www.skepticzone.tv/</a></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Announcing Journal Club</h1> <p>I am pleased to announce Data Skeptic is launching a new spin-off show called "Journal Club" with similar themes but a very different format to the Data Skeptic everyone is used to.</p> <p>In Journal Club, we will have a regular panel and occasional guest panelists to discuss interesting news items and one featured journal article every week in a roundtable discussion. Each week, I'll be joined by Lan Guo and George Kemp for a discussion of interesting data science related news articles and a featured journal or pre-print article.</p> <p>We hope that this podcast will give listeners an introduction to the works we cover and how people discuss these works. Our topics will often coincide with the original Data Skeptic podcast's current Interpretability theme, but we have few rules right now or what we pick. We enjoy discussing these items with each other and we hope you will do.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, we will start opening up the guest chair more often to bring new voices to our discussion. After that we'll be looking for ways we can engage with our audience.</p> <p>Keep reading and thanks for listening!</p> <p>Kyle</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The earliest efforts to apply machine learning to natural language tended to convert every token (every word, more or less) into a unique feature. While techniques like stemming may have cut the number of unique tokens down, researchers always had to face a problem that was highly dimensional.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A Click Through Rate (CTR) is the proportion of clicks to impressions of some item of content shared online. This terminology is most commonly used in digital advertising but applies just as well to content websites might choose to feature on their homepage or in search results.</p> <p>A CTR is intuitively appealing as a metric for optimization. After all, if users are disinterested in some content, under normal circumstances, it's reasonable to assume they would ignore the content, rather than clicking on it. On the other hand, the best content is likely to elicit a high CTR as users signal their interest by following the hyperlink.</p> <p>In the advertising world, a website could charge per impression, per click, or per action. Both impression and action based pricing have asymmetrical results for the publisher and advertiser. However, paying per click (CPC based advertising) seems to strike a nice balance. For this and other numeric reasons, many digital advertising mechanisms (such as Google Adwords) use CPC as the payment mechanism.</p> <p>When charging per click, an advertising platform will value a high CTR when selecting which ad to show. As we learned in our episode on <a href= "https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2016/goodharts-law">Goodhart's Law</a>, once a measure is turned into a target, it ceases to be a good measure. While CTR alone does not entirely drive most online advertising algorithms, it does play an important role. Thus, advertisers are incentivized to adopt strategies that maximize CTR.</p> <p>On the surface, this sounds like a great idea: provide internet users what they are looking for, and be awarded with their attention and lower advertising costs. However, one possible unintended consequence of this type of optimization is the creation of ads which are designed solely to generate clicks, regardless of if the users are happy with the page they visit after clicking a link.</p> <p>So, at least in part, websites that optimize for higher CTRs are going to favor content that does a good job getting viewers to click it. Getting a user to <em>view</em> a page is not totally synonymous with getting a user to <em>appreciate</em> the content of a page.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's spam filters are advanced data driven tools. They rely on a variety of techniques to effectively and often seamlessly filter out junk email from good email.</p> <p>Whitelists, blacklists, traffic analysis, network analysis, and a variety of other tools are probably employed by most major players in this area. Naturally content analysis can be an especially powerful tool for detecting spam.</p> <p>Given the binary nature of the problem (<img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Spam.svg" alt= "Spam" /> or <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/l_%5C%5Cneg+Spam.svg" alt="\neg Spam" />) its clear that this is a great problem to use machine learning to solve. In order to apply machine learning, you first need a labelled training set. Thankfully, many standard corpora of labelled spam data are readily available. Further, if you're working for a company with a spam filtering problem, often asking users to self-moderate or flag things as spam can be an effective way to generate a large amount of labels for "free".</p> <p>With a labeled dataset in hand, a data scientist working on spam filtering must next do feature engineering. This should be done with consideration of the algorithm that will be used. The Naive Bayesian Classifer has been a popular choice for detecting spam because it tends to perform pretty well on high dimensional data, unlike a lot of other ML algorithms. It also is very efficient to compute, making it possible to train a per-user Classifier if one wished to. While we might do some basic NLP tricks, for the most part, we can turn each word in a document (or perhaps each bigram or n-gram in a document) into a feature.</p> <p>The <em>Naive</em> part of the Naive Bayesian Classifier stems from the naive assumption that all features in one's analysis are considered to be independent. If <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/x.svg" alt= "x" /> and <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/y.svg" alt= "y" /> are known to be independent, then <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28x+%5C%5Ccap+y%29+%253D+Pr%28x%29+%5C%5Ccdot+Pr%28y%29.svg" alt="Pr(x \cap y) = Pr(x) \cdot Pr(y)" />. In other words, you just multiply the probabilities together. Shh, don't tell anyone, but this assumption is actually wrong! Certainly, if a document contains the word <em>algorithm</em>, it's more likely to contain the word <em>probability</em> than some randomly selected document. Thus, <img style= "box-sizing: border-box; outline: none; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%;" src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28%5C%5Ctext%7Balgorithm%7D+%5C%5Ccap+%5C%5Ctext%7Bprobability%7D%29+%253E+Pr%28%5C%5Ctext%7Balgorithm%7D%29+%5C%5Ccdot+Pr%28%5C%5Ctext%7Bprobability%7D%29.svg" alt= "Pr(\text{algorithm} \cap \text{probability}) > Pr(\text{algorithm}) \cdot Pr(\text{probability})" />, violating the assumption. Despite this "flaw", the Naive Bayesian Classifier works remarkably will on many problems. If one employs the common approach of converting a document into bigrams (pairs of words instead of single words), then you can capture a good deal of this correlation indirectly.</p> <p>In the final leg of the discussion, we explore the question of whether or not a Naive Bayesian Classifier would be a good choice for detecting fake news.</p> <div class="blog-related-content-container"> </div> <div class="blog-share-bar-container"> </div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We revisit the 2018 Microsoft Build in this episode, focusing on the latest ideas in DevOps. Kyle interviews Cloud Developer Advocates Damien Brady, Paige Bailey, and Donovan Brown to talk about DevOps and data science and databases.</p> <p>For a data scientist, what does it even mean to “build”? Packaging and deployment are things that a data scientist doesn't normally have to consider in their day-to-day work. The process of making an AI app is usually divided into two streams of work: data scientists building machine learning models and app developers building the application for end users to consume.</p> <p>DevOps includes all the parties involved in getting the application deployed and maintained and thinking about all the phases that follow and precede their part of the end solution. So what does DevOps mean for data science? Why should you adopt DevOps best practices?</p> <p>In the first half, Paige and Damian share their views on what DevOps for data science would look like and how it can be introduced to provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of data science models. In the second half, Donovan and Damian talk about the DevOps life cycle of putting a database under version control and carrying out deployments through a release pipeline.</p>]]></description>

The year is 2027, and a company called Shamony is announcing their new product, Ada, the most advanced artificial intelligence agent. To prove its superiority, the lead scientist announces that it will use the Turing Test that Alan Turing proposed in 1950. During this we introduce Turing’s “objections” outlined in his famous paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.”</p> <p>Following that, we talk with improv coach Holly Laurent on the art of improvisation and Peter Clark from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence about question and answering algorithms.</p>]]></description>

We’re going to be covering some of their work in two episodes on Data Skeptic. In this first part of our two-part episode, we'll talk about the data collection and brain imaging and the LONI pipeline. We'll then continue our coverage in the second episode, where we'll talk more about how researchers can gain insights about the human brain and their current challenges. Next week, we’ll also talk more about what all that has to do with data science machine learning and artificial intelligence. Joining us in this week’s episode are members of the LONI lab, which include principal investigators, Dr. Arthur Toga and Dr. Meng Law, and researchers, Farshid Sepherband, PhD and Ryan Cabeen, PhD.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In statistics, two random variables might depend on one another (for example, interest rates and new home purchases). We call this conditional dependence. An important related concept exists called conditional independence. This phrase describes situations in which two variables are independent of one another given some other variable.</p> <p>For example, the probability that a vendor will pay their bill on time could depend on many factors such as the company's market cap. Thus, a statistical analysis would reveal many relationships between observable details about the company and their propensity for paying on time. However, if you know that the company has filed for bankruptcy, then we might assume their chances of paying on time have dropped to near 0, and the result is now independent of all other factors in light of this new information.</p> <p>We discuss a few real world analogies to this idea in the context of some chance meetings on our recent trip to New York City.</p>]]></description>

This phrase describes situations in which two variables are independent of one another given some other variable.</p> <p>For example, the probability that a vendor will pay their bill on time could depend on many factors such as the company's market cap. Thus, a statistical analysis would reveal many relationships between observable details about the company and their propensity for paying on time. However, if you know that the company has filed for bankruptcy, then we might assume their chances of paying on time have dropped to near 0, and the result is now independent of all other factors in light of this new information.</p> <p>We discuss a few real world analogies to this idea in the context of some chance meetings on our recent trip to New York City.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Animals can't tell us when they're experiencing pain, so we have to rely on other cues to help treat their discomfort. But it is often difficult to tell how much an animal is suffering. The sheep, for instance, is the most inscrutable of animals. However, scientists have figured out a way to understand sheep facial expressions using artificial intelligence.</p> <p>On this week's episode, Dr. Marwa Mahmoud from the University of Cambridge joins us to discuss her recent study, "<a href= "http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pr10/publications/fg17.pdf">Estimating Sheep Pain Level Using Facial Action Unit Detection</a>." Marwa and her colleague's at Cambridge's Computer Laboratory developed an automated system using machine learning algorithms to detect and assess when a sheep is in pain. We discuss some details of her work, how she became interested in studying sheep facial expression to measure pain, and her future goals for this project.</p> <p>If you're able to be in Minneapolis, MN on August 23rd or 24th, consider attending Farcon.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Max-pooling is a procedure in a neural network which has several benefits. It performs dimensionality reduction by taking a collection of neurons and reducing them to a single value for future layers to receive as input. It can also prevent overfitting, since it takes a large set of inputs and admits only one value, making it harder to memorize the input. In this episode, we discuss the intuitive interpretation of max-pooling and why it's more common than mean-pooling or (theoretically) quartile-pooling.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>No reliable, complete database cataloging home sales data at a transaction level is available for the average person to access. To a data scientist interesting in studying this data, our hands are complete tied.

			<description><![CDATA[<h2>Feed Forward Neural Networks</h2> <p>In a feed forward neural network, neurons cannot form a cycle. In this episode, we explore how such a network would be able to represent three common logical operators: OR, AND, and XOR. The XOR operation is the interesting case.</p> <p>Below are the truth tables that describe each of these functions.</p> <h3>AND Truth Table</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="center">Input 1</th> <th align="center">Input 2</th> <th align="center">Output</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>OR Truth Table</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="center">Input 1</th> <th align="center">Input 2</th> <th align="center">Output</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>XOR Truth Table</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="center">Input 1</th> <th align="center">Input 2</th> <th align="center">Output</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The AND and OR functions should seem very intuitive. Exclusive or (XOR) if true if and only if exactly single input is 1. Could a neural network learn these mathematical functions?</p> <p>Let's consider the perceptron described below. First we see the visual representation, then the Activation function <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/25e26f99186ea1ba5b80cec1e7917d8896843465.svg" alt="A" />, followed by the formula for calculating the output.</p> <p> </p> <center> <p> </p> <p><img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic-static/img/2017/img1.svg" alt="" /></p> <p><img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic-static/img/2017/activation_func.svg" alt="" /></p> <p><img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.dataskeptic.com/latex/10136c2573d6998d27536bd440338884c46265f2.svg" alt= "Output = A(w_0 \cdot Bias + w_1 \cdot Input_1 + w_2 \cdot Input_2)" /></p> <p> </p> </center> <p> </p> <p>Can this perceptron learn the AND function?</p> <p>Sure. Let <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/848c86ee7e8564a3b9a3ea0dd7861275779496bc.svg" alt="w_0 = -0.6" /> and <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/b2a197856413cf77c51f6f44871688724812132e.svg" alt="w_1 = w_2 = 0.5" /></p> <p>What about OR?</p> <p>Yup.

This is also a good example of why the bias term is important. Without it, the AND function could not be represented.</p> <p>How about XOR?</p> <p>No. It is not possible to represent XOR with a single layer. It requires two layers. The image below shows how it could be done with two laters.</p> <p> </p> <center><img src= "https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/src-feed-forward-neural-networks/XOR_perceptron_net.png" alt="" /></center> <p> </p> <p>In the above example, the weights computed for the middle hidden node capture the essence of why this works.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If a CEO wants to know the state of their business, they ask their highest ranking executives. These executives, in turn, should know the state of the business through reports from their subordinates. This structure is roughly analogous to a process observed in deep learning, where each layer of the business reports up different types of observations, KPIs, and reports to be interpreted by the next layer of the business. In deep learning, this process can be thought of as automated feature engineering. DNNs built to recognize objects in images may learn structures that behave like edge detectors in the first hidden layer. Proceeding layers learn to compose more abstract features from lower level outputs. This episode explore that analogy in the context of automated feature engineering.</p> <p>Linh Da and Kyle discuss a particular image in this episode. The image included below in the show notes is drawn from the work of Lee, Grosse, Ranganath, and Ng in their paper <a href= "http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/icml09-cdbn.pdf">Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src= "http://localhost:3000/blog/episodes/2017/src-automated-feature-engineering/features.png" alt="" width="447" height="245" /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week I spoke with <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/elham">Elham Shaabani</a> and <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauloshakarian">Paulo Shakarian</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/pauloshakasu">@PauloShakASU</a>) about their recent paper <a href= "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2788618">Early Identification of Violent Criminal Gang Members</a> (also available on<a href= "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03965">arXiv</a>).

In this episode we explore how it applies to the problem of valuing a house. Aspects like the number of bedrooms go a long way in explaining why different houses have different prices. There's some amount of variance that can be explained by a model, and some amount that cannot be directly measured. R-squared is the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance. It's not a measure of accuracy, it's a measure of the power of one's model.</p>]]></description>

Laurie earned a PhD in Integrative Neuroscience from the Department of Psychology at the University of Chicago. In her life as a social neuroscientist, using fMRI to study the neural processes behind empathy and psychopathy, she learned the ropes of zooming in and out between the macroscopic and the microscopic -- how millions of data points come together to tell us something meaningful about human nature.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A discussion of the expected number of cars at a stoplight frames today's discussion of the bias variance tradeoff. The central ideal of this concept relates to model complexity. A very simple model will likely generalize well from training to testing data, but will have a very high variance since it's simplicity can prevent it from capturing the relationship between the covariates and the output. As a model grows more and more complex, it may capture more of the underlying data but the risk that it overfits the training data and therefore does not generalize (is biased) increases. The tradeoff between minimizing variance and minimizing bias is an ongoing challenge for data scientists, and an important discussion for skeptics around how much we should trust models.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our episode this week begins with a correction.

With an increasing number of features to consider, machine learning algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as they have a wider set and often sparser coverage of examples to consider. This episode explores a real life example of this as Kyle and Linhda discuss their thoughts on purchasing a home.</p> <p style= "margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;"> The curse of dimensionality was defined by Richard Bellman, and applies in several slightly nuanced cases. This mini-episode discusses how it applies on machine learning.</p> <p style= "margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;"> This episode does not, however, discuss a slightly different version of the curse of dimensionality which appears in decision theoretic situations. Consider the game of chess. One must think ahead several moves in order to execute a successful strategy. However, thinking ahead another move requires a consideration of every possible move of every piece controlled, and every possible response one's opponent may take. The space of possible future states of the board grows exponentially with the horizon one wants to look ahead to. This is present in the notably useful <a style= "color: #337ab7; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation">Bellman equation</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> This episode introduces the idea of a Markov Chain. A Markov Chain has a set of states describing a particular system, and a probability of moving from one state to another along every valid connected state. Markov Chains are memoryless, meaning they don't rely on a long history of previous observations. The current state of a system depends only on the previous state and the results of a random outcome.</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> Markov Chains are a useful way method for describing non-deterministic systems. They are useful for destribing the state and transition model of a stochastic system.</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> As examples of Markov Chains, we discuss stop light signals, bowling, and text prediction systems in light of whether or not they can be described with Markov Chains.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> Economist Peter Backus joins me in this episode to discuss a few interesting topics. You may recall Linhda and I previously discussed his paper "<a href= "http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/pbackus/girlfriend">The Girlfriend Equation</a>" on a recent mini-episode. We start by touching base on this fun paper and get a follow up on where Peter stands years after writing w.r.t. a successful romantic union. Additionally, we delve in to some fascinating economics topics.</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> We touch on questions of the role models, for better or for worse, played a role in the ~2008 economic crash, statistics in economics and the difficulty of measurement, and some insightful discussion about the economics charities. Peter encourages listeners to be open to giving money to charities that are good at fundraising, and his arguement is a (for me) suprisingly insightful logic. Lastly, we have a teaser of some of Peter's upcoming work using unconventional data sources.</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> For his benevolent recommendation, Peter recommended the book <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Conquest-Happiness-Bertrand-Russell/dp/0871401622">The Conquest of Happiness</a> by Bertrand Russell, and for his self-serving recommendation, follow Peter on twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/Awesomnomics">@Awesomnomics</a>.</p>]]></description>

And for a self serving recommendation, follow him on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/tslevi">@tslevi</a>) or connect with <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-levi/32/94/40a">Thomas Levi on Linkedin</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> The Data Skeptic Podcast is launching a contest- not one of chance, but one of skill. Listeners are encouraged to put their data science skills to good use, or if all else fails, guess!</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> The contest works as follows. Below is some data about the cumulative number of downloads the podcast has achieved on a few given dates. Your job is to predict the date and time at which the podcast will recieve download number 27,182. Why this arbitrary number? It's as good as any other arbitrary number!</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> Use whatever means you want to formulate a prediction. Once you have it, wait until that time and then post a review of the Data Skeptic Podcast on iTunes. You don't even have to leave a good review! The review which is posted closest to the actual time at which this download occurs will win a free copy of Matthew Russell's "Mining the Social Web" courtesy of the Data Skeptic Podcast. "Price is Right" rules are in play - the winner is the person that posts their review closest to the actual time without going over.</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> More information at dataskeptic.com</p>]]></description>

Once you have it, wait until that time and then post a review of the Data Skeptic Podcast on iTunes. You don't even have to leave a good review! The review which is posted closest to the actual time at which this download occurs will win a free copy of Matthew Russell's "Mining the Social Web" courtesy of the Data Skeptic Podcast. "Price is Right" rules are in play - the winner is the person that posts their review closest to the actual time without going over.</p> <p style= "color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;"> More information at dataskeptic.com</p>]]></content:encoded>
