      <title>Joe Masilotti: Simplify Your Stack, Ship Mobile Sooner</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <i>Maintainable</i>, Robby speaks with <a href="https://masilotti.com/">Joe Masilotti</a>, an independent consultant who helps Rails teams ship mobile apps using Hotwire Native.</p><p>Joe shares his perspective on what makes software maintainable—especially for consultants who need to onboard quickly. He explains why setup scripts often add unnecessary complexity, and how he evaluates a project’s maintainability by how quickly he can go from clone to coding.</p><p>Robby and Joe also discuss how hybrid mobile development can offer faster delivery, fewer bugs, and better long-term flexibility—especially when teams reuse their existing Rails web views. Joe explains how Hotwire Native allows teams to incrementally introduce native features without rewriting their entire app.</p><p>Whether you’re maintaining a mobile shell built two years ago or just starting to explore native development, Joe offers actionable advice on setting expectations, scoping client work, and navigating modern mobile tech stacks.</p><h3>⏱️ Episode Highlights</h3><p>[00:01:17] Onboarding as a Measure of Maintainability<br />Joe shares how quickly he can spin up a Rails app often reflects how maintainable it is.</p><p>[00:05:12] Being a Good Guest in Someone Else’s Codebase<br />Joe outlines his ideal onboarding checklist and how he adapts to unfamiliar environments.</p><p>[00:08:00] Setting Communication and Collaboration Expectations<br />The three questions Joe asks every client to understand how their team works.</p><p>[00:13:02] Offering Opinions—Only Where Invited<br />Why Joe stays scoped to the work he’s hired for, even when tempted to fix more.</p><p>[00:14:15] When Technical Debt Enters the Conversation<br />Joe explains how debt discussions usually emerge after version one is shipped.</p><p>[00:15:33] Who Should Read <i>Hotwire Native for Rails Developers</i><br />Joe describes the type of developer his book is written for and what it covers.</p><p>[00:18:01] Choosing Native vs. Hybrid for Your Rails App<br />A framework comparison based on your current frontend architecture.</p><p>[00:20:00] Introducing the Hotwire Native Mindset<br />Why logic belongs on the server and the client should stay thin.</p><p>[00:21:00] Bridge Components: How Rails, iOS, and Android Connect<br />Joe walks through how native and web technologies pass data between layers.</p><p>[00:24:00] Why Even a Web View-Based App is Worth Shipping<br />The practical benefits of discoverability, push notifications, and native APIs.</p><p>[00:28:01] Replacing Unmaintainable Apps with Hotwire Native<br />Joe describes how hybrid rewrites often reduce mobile code by 90%.</p><p>[00:31:33] Letting Go of Feature Parity<br />Why most clients end up cutting features they originally wanted to preserve.</p><p>[00:32:18] Scoping and Estimating Project-Based Work<br />How Joe uses repeatable patterns to price fixed-fee consulting engagements.</p><p>[00:35:15] Using AI to Translate Between Tech Stacks<br />Joe shares how he leverages LLMs to explore unfamiliar languages like Kotlin.</p><p>[00:42:26] Long-Term Maintainability and When to Touch the Code<br />Why some apps don’t need changes for years—and that’s okay.</p><p>[00:43:43] Why Hybrid Apps Are Easier to Replace<br />Joe explains why hybrid apps are often more disposable and less risky than monolithic web apps.</p><h3>🔗 Resources Mentioned:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/jmnative/hotwire-native-for-rails-developers/">Joe’s Book: <i>Hotwire Native for Rails Developers</i></a></li><li><a href="https://masilotti.com/newsletter/">Joe’s Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="https://masilotti.com/turbo-native-is-dead-long-live-hotwire-native/">Hotwire Native Mindset Article</a></li><li><a href="https://www.juliovincent.com/please"><i>Please Unsubscribe, Thanks</i> by Julio Vincent Gambuto</a></li></ul><p>Follow Joe on <a href="https://x.com/joemasilotti">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and visit <a href="https://masilotti.com/">masilotti.com</a> to learn more.</p><h3>Thanks to Our Sponsor!</h3><p>Turn hours of debugging into just minutes! <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/?utm_source=maintainable&utm_medium=podcast">AppSignal</a> is a performance monitoring and error-tracking tool designed for Ruby, Elixir, Python, Node.js, Javascript, and other frameworks.</p><p>It offers six powerful features with one simple interface, providing developers with real-time insights into the performance and health of web applications.</p><p>Keep your coding cool and error-free, one line at a time! </p><p>Use the code <strong>maintainable</strong> to get a 10% discount for your first year. <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/?utm_source=maintainable&utm_medium=podcast">Check them out!</a></p>

      <title>Freedom Dumlao: What 70 Java Services Taught Me About Focus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apiguy/">Freedom Dumlao</a> (CTO at <a href="https://www.vestmark.com">Vestmark</a>) joins Robby to explore what it means to maintain software at scale—and why teams sometimes need to unlearn the hype.</p><p>With two decades of experience supporting financial systems, Freedom shares how his team manages a Java monolith that oversees $1.6 trillion in assets. But what’s most surprising? His story of how a team working on 70+ microservices rebuilt their platform as a single Ruby on Rails monolith—and started shipping faster than ever before.</p><h3>Episode Highlights</h3><p>[00:02:00] <strong>Why Respecting Legacy Code Matters</strong><br />Freedom reflects on a lesson he learned at Amazon: "Respect what came before." He discusses the value of honoring the decisions of past developers—especially when their context is unknown.</p><p>[00:05:00] <strong>How Tests Help (and Where They Don’t)</strong><br />Freedom discusses how tests can clarify system behavior but not always intent—especially when market logic or business-specific rules come into play.</p><p>[00:07:00] <strong>The Value of Understudies in Engineering</strong><br />Freedom shares how his team intentionally pairs subject matter experts with understudies to reduce risk and transfer knowledge.</p><p>[00:09:30] <strong>Rethinking Technical Debt</strong><br />He challenges the fear-based framing of technical debt, comparing it instead to a strategic mortgage.</p><p>[00:17:00] <strong>From 70 Services to 1 Monolith</strong><br />At FlexCar, Freedom led an unconventional rewrite—consolidating 70 Java microservices into a single Rails app. The result? A dramatic increase in velocity and ownership.</p><p>[00:25:00] <strong>Choosing Rails Over Phoenix, Laravel, and Django</strong><br />After evaluating multiple frameworks, Rails' cohesiveness, Hotwire, and quick developer ramp-up made it the clear winner—even converting skeptical team members.</p><p>[00:31:00] <strong>How Rails Changed Team Dynamics</strong><br />By reducing dependency handoffs, the new Rails app enabled solo engineers to own complete features. The impact? Faster delivery and more engaged developers.</p><p>[00:36:30] <strong>Why Rails Still Makes Sense at a 20-Year-Old Company</strong><br />Even with a large Java codebase, Vestmark uses Rails for rapid prototyping and new product development.</p><p>[00:41:00] <strong>Using AI to Navigate Legacy Systems</strong><br />Freedom explains how his team uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to surface relevant code—but also the limitations of AI on older or less common codebases.</p><p>[00:51:00] <strong>Seek Feedback, Not Consensus</strong><br />Freedom explains why aiming for alignment slows teams down—and how decision-makers can be inclusive without waiting for full agreement.</p><h3>Links and Resources</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/freedomdumlao/">Freedom Dumlao on LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vestmark.com">Vestmark</a></li><li><a href="https://www.norulesrules.com/">No Rules Rules</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads">Dungeon Crawler Carl series</a></li></ul><h3>Thanks to Our Sponsor!</h3><p>Turn hours of debugging into just minutes! <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/?utm_source=maintainable&utm_medium=podcast">AppSignal</a> is a performance monitoring and error-tracking tool designed for Ruby, Elixir, Python, Node.js, Javascript, and other frameworks.</p><p>It offers six powerful features with one simple interface, providing developers with real-time insights into the performance and health of web applications.</p><p>Keep your coding cool and error-free, one line at a time! </p><p>Use the code <strong>maintainable</strong> to get a 10% discount for your first year. <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/?utm_source=maintainable&utm_medium=podcast">Check them out!</a></p>

Her guiding principle? Well-maintained software is friendly software—code that is understandable and approachable, especially for early-career developers.</p><p>Together, they discuss how to audit and stabilize older systems, avoid full rewrites, and create consistent developer experiences in large applications. Mercedes reflects on her decade in consulting and how that shaped her approach to navigating incomplete documentation, missing historical context, and multiple competing patterns in a codebase. She breaks down different types of technical debt, explains why not all of it is inherently bad, and offers strategies for advocating for maintenance work across engineering and product teams.</p><p>The conversation also touches on architecture patterns like job fan-out, measuring performance regressions, reducing infrastructure load, and building momentum for improvements even when leadership isn’t actively prioritizing them.</p><p>If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by a messy project or struggled to justify maintenance work, this episode will leave you with a fresh mindset—and a few practical tactics—for making code more sustainable and inclusive.</p><h3>Episode Highlights</h3><p>[00:01:08] <strong>Defining Well-Maintained Software</strong><br />Mercedes explains her top metric: software that feels <i>friendly</i>, especially to early-career developers navigating the codebase for the first time.</p><p>[00:03:00] <strong>What Friendly Code Actually Looks Like</strong><br />She shares why consistency, discoverability, and light documentation (like class comments or UML snippets) can make a huge difference.</p><p>[00:05:00] <strong>Assessing Code Like a House Tour</strong><br />Mercedes introduces her metaphor of giving a house tour to evaluate code: does everything feel like it’s in the right place—or is the stove in the cabinet?</p><p>[00:06:53] <strong>Consulting Mindset: Being a Guest in the Codebase</strong><br />With a decade of consulting experience, Mercedes shares how she navigates legacy systems when historical context is long gone.</p><p>[00:10:40] <strong>Stabilizing a Startup’s Tangled Architecture</strong><br />She walks through an in-depth case study where she helped a client with multiple abandoned services get back to stability—without a rewrite.</p><p>[00:17:00] <strong>The Power of a One-Line Fix</strong><br />Mercedes shares how a missing check caused a job to fan out 30 million no-op background jobs a day—and how one line of code reduced that by 75%.</p><p>[00:23:40] <strong>Why State Checks Belong Everywhere</strong><br />She explains how defense-in-depth patterns help avoid job queue flooding and protect system resources early in the fan-out process.</p><p>[00:24:59] <strong>Reframing Technical Debt</strong><br />Not all debt is bad.

      <title>Chris Salvato: Building Developer Paradise by Sitting in the Problem Space</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Software isn’t always about rapid iteration. Sometimes, the real challenge lies in carefully assessing the existing environment. <a href="https://github.com/csalvato">Chris Salvato</a>, a Senior Staff Engineer at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, believes that spending time in the “problem space” is vital for any long-lived application. Rather than diving immediately into controllers and tests, he begins by talking to everyone who interacts with the code—engineers, product owners, even directors who oversee strategy. This approach reveals hidden friction points that rarely come to light in larger, more formal meetings.</p><p>When code grows organically over years, a range of issues emerges. Small workarounds might accumulate, new features can overlap with older ones, and domain boundaries become murky. Chris suggests mapping these overlaps through in-depth conversations so the team can pinpoint what genuinely obstructs productivity. He emphasizes that many developers may focus on surface fixes—updating a library here, renaming a class there—without acknowledging underlying confusion in the domain model itself. Removing extraneous code, clarifying domain entities, and aligning the team’s understanding can drastically reduce missteps.</p><p>An interesting aspect of Chris’s method is his view of “developer paradise.” A codebase reaches this state when new contributors can navigate it with minimal help. Instead of sifting through endless documentation or complex wikis, they can figure out how classes, modules, and services connect simply by reading the code. Chris notes that achieving this often involves pruning unnecessary files or responsibilities. The end result is software that “self-documents,” easing onboarding and reducing reliance on external explanations.</p><p>The conversation also touches on how large language models (LLMs) fit into the puzzle. Many organizations see AI-driven coding assistants as a way to accelerate development. Chris agrees they have potential, yet highlights a critical requirement: the code must be well-organized. If the system is sprawling and inconsistent, these tools may only add confusion. Lean, carefully segmented projects let both people and AI more effectively track what’s happening under the hood.</p><p>Reducing code bloat leads naturally to discussions about prioritizing. Chris encourages teams not to tackle every annoyance at once. He references the importance of framing a unifying question, such as “Which feature or aspect of the app causes the greatest confusion among team members?” Spending too little time on this question, he warns, results in half-hearted improvements that eventually revert back to chaos. By contrast, devoting a few dedicated sprints—guided by thoughtful one-on-one interviews—can create lasting changes that set the entire codebase on a better trajectory.</p><p>One intriguing theme is how personal growth ties into organizational impact. Chris acknowledges that developers often switch companies every few years, which might discourage them from investing deeply in a legacy codebase they won’t maintain long-term. Yet taking the lead in clarifying domain logic or reorganizing outdated sections is a skill-building opportunity. Future employers also notice engineers who can transform messy architectures into clear, future-friendly systems. In that sense, there’s a mutual benefit: the company gains maintainable software, while the developer acquires project leadership experience.</p><p>The idea of “sitting in the problem space” resonates throughout Chris’s remarks. He encourages engineers to resist the reflex to propose solutions too early. Instead, they should keep asking why a particular annoyance or bug persists. Is it a symptom of a misaligned feature set, or is it rooted in limited domain knowledge among contributors? By reframing those frustrations as questions about responsibilities, the team often discovers simpler fixes than a heavy-handed rewrite. Conversely, where deeper rewrites are indeed warranted, Chris believes it’s best for the team to see that direction as unanimous rather than dictated from the top.</p><p>Long-standing software also carries emotional baggage. People might have strong feelings about how something “ought” to be done, or they may have encountered recurring hurdles. Chris advocates using one-on-one conversations to let these concerns surface naturally, free from the pressure of group settings where quieter voices might hold back. Once everyone’s perspective is heard, common threads become clearer, enabling the team to converge on a smaller list of genuinely important tasks. When the group reconvenes, the sense of shared purpose helps unify efforts in a way that scattered brainstorming rarely achieves.</p><p>The conversation also highlights resourceful domain modeling, which draws some inspiration from the microservices world but doesn’t necessarily require the code to be broken up into tiny services. Instead, Chris suggests that well-defined boundaries within a monolith can deliver comparable clarity—if the team respects those boundaries. He points to examples like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> or reading materials on <a href="https://www.domainlanguage.com/">Domain-Driven Design</a> to show how cohesive object structures can help avoid big architectural hurdles.</p><p>His closing thoughts revolve around long-term sustainability. Even if an engineer isn’t planning to remain on a project indefinitely, they can leave a meaningful legacy by clarifying crucial parts of the code, championing simpler naming conventions, and encouraging more open dialogue among team members. The impact, Chris notes, goes beyond the immediate project: every person who touches that code later benefits from these improvements, often for years to come.</p><p>Time-Stamped Highlights</p><p><strong>[00:00:00] Welcome and Well-Maintained Software:</strong><br />Robby opens by asking Chris about foundational traits of dependable, long-lasting codebases.</p><p><strong>[00:00:58] Defining “Well Maintained”:</strong><br />They explore how clear conventions and minimal bloat not only reduce confusion but also prolong the life of a system.</p><p><strong>[00:01:28] LLMs and Context Windows:</strong><br />Chris delves into why large codebases challenge AI-driven coding assistants—and how trim, well-modeled systems sidestep this pitfall.</p><p><strong>[00:02:00] Joining Shopify and Facing Legacy Systems:</strong><br />Chris recalls his early days at Shopify, realizing that older Rails apps demanded a more structured method of discovery.</p><p><strong>[00:03:08] Concept of “Developer Paradise”:</strong><br />He shares his perspective on how removing unneeded documentation and extraneous complexity makes daily development more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>[00:05:32] Framework for Tackling Old Code:</strong><br />Chris outlines his signature approach: booking numerous 1-on-1 meetings to gather honest feedback from stakeholders before touching the code.</p><p><strong>[00:07:15] Finding High-Leverage Problems:</strong><br />Robby and Chris discuss distilling this feedback into a shortlist of real bottlenecks that the team can tackle together.</p><p><strong>[00:15:00] From Problem Space to Solutions:</strong><br />They spotlight the value of framing a single unifying question—like “How do we reduce confusion?”—to keep everyone working toward the same outcome.</p><p><strong>[00:20:07] Balancing Personal Goals and Company Needs:</strong><br />Chris underlines how aligning individual ambitions with business objectives fosters commitment to sustained improvement.</p><p><strong>[00:32:00] Long-Term Value and Leadership:</strong><br />Closing out, Robby and Chris consider how short-tenure engineers can leave a lasting impact by helping a team focus on its biggest pain points.</p><p><strong>Resources & Mentions</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a></li><li><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/csalvato">Chris’s GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/csalvato/">Chris’s LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/salvatochris">Chris’s Twitter/X</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776"><i>The One Thing</i> by Gary Keller</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303"><i>Titan: The Life of John D.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software isn’t always about rapid iteration. Sometimes, the real challenge lies in carefully assessing the existing environment. <a href="https://github.com/csalvato">Chris Salvato</a>, a Senior Staff Engineer at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, believes that spending time in the “problem space” is vital for any long-lived application. Rather than diving immediately into controllers and tests, he begins by talking to everyone who interacts with the code—engineers, product owners, even directors who oversee strategy. This approach reveals hidden friction points that rarely come to light in larger, more formal meetings.</p><p>When code grows organically over years, a range of issues emerges. Small workarounds might accumulate, new features can overlap with older ones, and domain boundaries become murky. Chris suggests mapping these overlaps through in-depth conversations so the team can pinpoint what genuinely obstructs productivity. He emphasizes that many developers may focus on surface fixes—updating a library here, renaming a class there—without acknowledging underlying confusion in the domain model itself. Removing extraneous code, clarifying domain entities, and aligning the team’s understanding can drastically reduce missteps.</p><p>An interesting aspect of Chris’s method is his view of “developer paradise.” A codebase reaches this state when new contributors can navigate it with minimal help. Instead of sifting through endless documentation or complex wikis, they can figure out how classes, modules, and services connect simply by reading the code. Chris notes that achieving this often involves pruning unnecessary files or responsibilities. The end result is software that “self-documents,” easing onboarding and reducing reliance on external explanations.</p><p>The conversation also touches on how large language models (LLMs) fit into the puzzle. Many organizations see AI-driven coding assistants as a way to accelerate development. Chris agrees they have potential, yet highlights a critical requirement: the code must be well-organized. If the system is sprawling and inconsistent, these tools may only add confusion. Lean, carefully segmented projects let both people and AI more effectively track what’s happening under the hood.</p><p>Reducing code bloat leads naturally to discussions about prioritizing. Chris encourages teams not to tackle every annoyance at once. He references the importance of framing a unifying question, such as “Which feature or aspect of the app causes the greatest confusion among team members?” Spending too little time on this question, he warns, results in half-hearted improvements that eventually revert back to chaos. By contrast, devoting a few dedicated sprints—guided by thoughtful one-on-one interviews—can create lasting changes that set the entire codebase on a better trajectory.</p><p>One intriguing theme is how personal growth ties into organizational impact. Chris acknowledges that developers often switch companies every few years, which might discourage them from investing deeply in a legacy codebase they won’t maintain long-term. Yet taking the lead in clarifying domain logic or reorganizing outdated sections is a skill-building opportunity. Future employers also notice engineers who can transform messy architectures into clear, future-friendly systems. In that sense, there’s a mutual benefit: the company gains maintainable software, while the developer acquires project leadership experience.</p><p>The idea of “sitting in the problem space” resonates throughout Chris’s remarks. He encourages engineers to resist the reflex to propose solutions too early. Instead, they should keep asking why a particular annoyance or bug persists. Is it a symptom of a misaligned feature set, or is it rooted in limited domain knowledge among contributors? By reframing those frustrations as questions about responsibilities, the team often discovers simpler fixes than a heavy-handed rewrite. Conversely, where deeper rewrites are indeed warranted, Chris believes it’s best for the team to see that direction as unanimous rather than dictated from the top.</p><p>Long-standing software also carries emotional baggage. People might have strong feelings about how something “ought” to be done, or they may have encountered recurring hurdles. Chris advocates using one-on-one conversations to let these concerns surface naturally, free from the pressure of group settings where quieter voices might hold back. Once everyone’s perspective is heard, common threads become clearer, enabling the team to converge on a smaller list of genuinely important tasks. When the group reconvenes, the sense of shared purpose helps unify efforts in a way that scattered brainstorming rarely achieves.</p><p>The conversation also highlights resourceful domain modeling, which draws some inspiration from the microservices world but doesn’t necessarily require the code to be broken up into tiny services. Instead, Chris suggests that well-defined boundaries within a monolith can deliver comparable clarity—if the team respects those boundaries. He points to examples like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> or reading materials on <a href="https://www.domainlanguage.com/">Domain-Driven Design</a> to show how cohesive object structures can help avoid big architectural hurdles.</p><p>His closing thoughts revolve around long-term sustainability. Even if an engineer isn’t planning to remain on a project indefinitely, they can leave a meaningful legacy by clarifying crucial parts of the code, championing simpler naming conventions, and encouraging more open dialogue among team members. The impact, Chris notes, goes beyond the immediate project: every person who touches that code later benefits from these improvements, often for years to come.</p><p>Time-Stamped Highlights</p><p><strong>[00:00:00] Welcome and Well-Maintained Software:</strong><br />Robby opens by asking Chris about foundational traits of dependable, long-lasting codebases.</p><p><strong>[00:00:58] Defining “Well Maintained”:</strong><br />They explore how clear conventions and minimal bloat not only reduce confusion but also prolong the life of a system.</p><p><strong>[00:01:28] LLMs and Context Windows:</strong><br />Chris delves into why large codebases challenge AI-driven coding assistants—and how trim, well-modeled systems sidestep this pitfall.</p><p><strong>[00:02:00] Joining Shopify and Facing Legacy Systems:</strong><br />Chris recalls his early days at Shopify, realizing that older Rails apps demanded a more structured method of discovery.</p><p><strong>[00:03:08] Concept of “Developer Paradise”:</strong><br />He shares his perspective on how removing unneeded documentation and extraneous complexity makes daily development more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>[00:05:32] Framework for Tackling Old Code:</strong><br />Chris outlines his signature approach: booking numerous 1-on-1 meetings to gather honest feedback from stakeholders before touching the code.</p><p><strong>[00:07:15] Finding High-Leverage Problems:</strong><br />Robby and Chris discuss distilling this feedback into a shortlist of real bottlenecks that the team can tackle together.</p><p><strong>[00:15:00] From Problem Space to Solutions:</strong><br />They spotlight the value of framing a single unifying question—like “How do we reduce confusion?”—to keep everyone working toward the same outcome.</p><p><strong>[00:20:07] Balancing Personal Goals and Company Needs:</strong><br />Chris underlines how aligning individual ambitions with business objectives fosters commitment to sustained improvement.</p><p><strong>[00:32:00] Long-Term Value and Leadership:</strong><br />Closing out, Robby and Chris consider how short-tenure engineers can leave a lasting impact by helping a team focus on its biggest pain points.</p><p><strong>Resources & Mentions</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a></li><li><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/csalvato">Chris’s GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/csalvato/">Chris’s LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/salvatochris">Chris’s Twitter/X</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776"><i>The One Thing</i> by Gary Keller</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303"><i>Titan: The Life of John D.

      <title>Noémi Ványi: Only Fix Problems That Are Actually Problems</title>

      <title>Julia López: Code Tells a Story—Even the White Spaces</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How much can legacy code tell us beyond just functionality? Julia López, <strong>Senior Software Engineer at </strong><a href="https://www.getharvest.com/"><strong>Harvest</strong></a>, believes that even small details—such as white spaces, variable names, and formatting choices—can reveal a system’s history.</p><p>In this episode, Julia and Robby discuss the importance of refactoring and how a strong engineering culture can make or break a team's ability to maintain and improve software over time. Julia shares her experience leading a multi-year overhaul of Harvest’s billing system, balancing stakeholder expectations while ensuring the rewrite delivered real value.</p><p>They explore how refactoring decisions evolve as teams grow, how to mentor newer developers to feel empowered to make changes, and why Julia doesn’t always trust her own estimations (for good reason). She also opens up about the complexities of transitioning a live billing system while supporting customers, finance teams, and engineering operations—all without disrupting payments.</p><p>Beyond technical decisions, they also dive into the challenges of communication in remote teams, the value of autonomy in software development, and how teams can make a case for technical debt reduction even when leadership isn’t prioritizing it. If you've ever struggled with refactoring legacy systems or advocating for improvements, this conversation is packed with practical lessons.</p><h2><strong>💡 Key Topics & Timestamps</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>[00:00:22] Meet Julia López</strong> – Her background, role at Harvest, and passion for refactoring.</li><li><strong>[00:00:42] What Makes Software Maintainable?</strong> – A test suite you can trust and an engineering culture that values refactoring.</li><li><strong>[00:06:31] Leading Harvest’s Billing System Overhaul</strong> – Why a full rewrite made more sense than incremental improvements.</li><li><strong>[00:09:54] The Hidden Complexity of Billing Systems</strong> – Managing ACH, credit card, and invoice payments.</li><li><strong>[00:14:05] The Fear Factor in Large-Scale Refactoring</strong> – Why organizations hesitate and how to push forward.</li><li><strong>[00:18:47] Communication Challenges in Remote Teams</strong> – Why documentation and transparency matter beyond GitHub.</li><li><strong>[00:28:30] Finding and Enforcing Engineering Patterns</strong> – How teams can encourage consistency in a constantly evolving codebase.</li><li><strong>[00:35:45] Why Autonomy Matters for Developers</strong> – Learning through struggle and when to ask for help.</li><li><strong>[00:45:25] Advocating for Refactoring When Leadership Says No</strong> – Julia's approach: "Ask for forgiveness, not permission—but estimate higher."</li></ul><h2><strong>🔗 Resources Mentioned</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> – Julia's company</li><li><a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/">Radical Candor</a> by Kim Scott</li><li><a href="https://www.juliezhuo.com/book">The Making of a Manager</a> by Julie Zhuo</li><li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> – The payment processor used in Harvest’s billing system</li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame">Git Blame</a> – A tool for understanding code history</li></ul><h2><strong>📢 Connect with Julia López</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://julialopez.dev/">Julia's Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julialopez/">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.github.com/yukideluxe">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julialopez.dev">BlueSky</a></li></ul><h2><strong>🍇Thanks to Our Sponsor!</strong></h2><p><a href="https://letsjelly.com/maintainable?jelly_ad=maintainable&utm_campaign=winter_podcasts_2025&utm_medium=podcast_ad&utm_source=maintainable_podcast" target="_blank"><strong>Jelly</strong></a><strong> is the simplest, most affordable way to deal with your “contact@...” emails.</strong></p><p>Tired of sharing an email login, or CCing colleagues to loop them into conversations?

      <title>Scott Hanselman - The Fear Factor in Maintainable Software</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Maintainable, Robby welcomes Scott Hanselman, VP of Developer Community at Microsoft and host of the Hanselminutes Podcast, to discuss the emotional side of maintainable software.

Aiming for good, solid repeatable work over perfection ultimately yields better results.</li><li>He uses his own projects, like the Hanselminutes podcast, as examples of focusing on consistent outputs and utilizing a simple workflow.</li><li>Scott advocates for using AI tools to transcribe coding sessions, freeing up developers from extensive note-taking.</li></ol><h2>Book Recommendation:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736">The Daily Stoic By Ryan Holiday</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman - Personal Website</a></li><li><a href="https://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/">.NET Open Source History: .NET Core | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><h2>Helpful Links:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman - Personal Website</a></li><li><a href="https://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/">.NET Open Source History: .NET Core | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><h2>Thanks to Our Sponsor!</h2><p>Turn hours of debugging into just minutes!<a href="https://www.appsignal.com/?utm_source=maintainable&utm_medium=podcast"> AppSignal</a> is a performance monitoring and error tracking tool designed for Ruby, Elixir, Python, Node.js, Javascript, and soon, other frameworks. </p><p>It offers six powerful features with one simple interface, providing developers with real-time insights into the performance and health of web applications. </p><p>Keep your coding cool and error-free, one line at a time! <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/?utm_source=maintainable&utm_medium=podcast">Check them out!</a></p>

      <title>Staffan Nöteberg - On the Power of Monotasking in Software Development</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this insightful episode, we dive deep into the essence of software maintainability with Agile Coach and author Staffan Nöteberg. Unpacking the layers of what it takes for software to be considered well-maintained, Staffan sheds light on the crucial roles of abstraction and modularity. These foundational elements not only make software easier to understand for newcomers but also ensure that it can evolve and adapt over time without becoming bogged down by complexity.</p><p>The conversation takes a pivotal turn towards the often misunderstood concept of technical debt. With Staffan's expertise, listeners gain a nuanced understanding of why technical debt is more than just a buzzword - it's a crucial aspect of software development that requires careful communication, especially with those in management positions. This leads into an exploration of monotasking as a transformative approach to productivity. Unlike the common practice of juggling multiple tasks, monotasking focuses on dedicating one's attention to the most critical task at hand, thereby enhancing efficiency and output quality.</p><p>Further enriching the discussion, Staffan introduces the concept of panorama sessions. These are strategic moments set aside to reassess and prioritize tasks, ensuring that efforts are always aligned with the most impactful objectives. Such strategies not only streamline the development process but also foster a more collaborative and agile workplace. As the episode unfolds, listeners are invited to reflect on their own practices and consider how embracing a monotasking approach could revolutionize their work and the software they develop.</p><p>For those looking to dive deeper into the principles discussed and discover practical strategies for applying them, Staffan Nöteberg's book, "Monotasking," comes highly recommended. It's a resource that promises to change how you view productivity and software development.</p><h2>Book Recommendation:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337123.Complexity?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=b6C0sLTB5r&rank=4">Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos by M.

      <title>Martin Emde - Ruby Central and the Art of Being Tolerant to Change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Maintainable, our host Robby Russell sits down with <a href="https://martinemde.com/">Martin Emde</a>, a sage in the Ruby community and the current Director of Open Source at<a href="https://rubycentral.org/"> Ruby Central</a>. Together, they weave through the intricacies of maintainable software, legacy code, and the unwavering power of the Ruby ecosystem. Martin, with his wealth of experience, shares tales from the trenches of open-source software development, focusing on <a href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> and <a href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, and how they've evolved to face the challenges of modern software needs.</p><p>Martin addresses the elephant in the room - complexity in software. He muses on the natural progression of software projects from simplicity to complexity, drawing parallels to the growth of living organisms. It's not about fighting complexity, but embracing it with open arms, ensuring the software remains adaptable and maintainable.

      <title>Kyle Daigle - Scaling Up with AI: A New Era of Code Maintenance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Kyle Daigle, the Chief Operating Officer at GitHub. They dive into the evolution of software development from the perspective of maintaining and scaling software within large organizations like GitHub. Kyle talks about the importance of simplicity and readability in code over complexity, advocating for well-named variables and straightforward codebases to enhance maintainability.</p><p>He reflects on his journey from a young developer to understanding the value of well-maintained software, noting the balance between creativity in naming and the necessity for clarity as projects and teams grow. The conversation also covers the approach to technical debt, highlighting that not all old code is debt, but rather it depends on whether it hinders progress. </p><p>Additionally, they explore the impact of AI tools like GitHub Copilot on software development, suggesting that these tools can aid in quicker code reviews and foster higher-level problem-solving discussions among developers.

      <title>Jacob Aronoff - At Least One Person Who Cares To See It Through</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Staff Software Engineer at Lightstep from ServiceNow, Jacob Aronoff. Their conversation delves into the vital signs of a thriving open source software project. They unpack the characteristics of well-maintained open source endeavors, emphasizing the importance of a passionate community behind the project, rather than misleading indicators like GitHub stars. They discuss the nuances of evaluating a project's health through performance metrics, suggesting that a more holistic view that includes the scrutiny of open issues can provide better insights into the project's robustness and responsiveness to community needs. </p><p>Furthermore, their discussion highlights a critical, yet often overlooked, aspect of open source software: the project's own dependencies. Jacob argues that understanding these dependencies is crucial before adopting an open source solution, as it could have far-reaching implications on the stability and security of one's own project. They also take a deep dive into the organizational dynamics of the OpenTelemetry community, examining its structured approach to scaling and sustaining the project over time. Their discussion then transitions into the philosophical debate of balancing between the extremes of premature abstraction and delivering a fully opinionated software project. </p><p>Jacob shares his penchant for “building in the open”, advocating for transparency and community involvement in the development process. He provides valuable advice for both newcomers looking to contribute to open source projects and maintainers seeking to attract new talent. In a personal touch, he extends his gratitude to Robby for creating Oh My Zsh, sharing his own journey in developing a custom theme for it. <br /> </p><p>Moreover, Jacob expresses his preference for pure functional languages, hinting at the broader discussion around programming paradigms and their influence on open source software development.

      <title>Oliver Drotbohm - Modulithic Applications</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Oliver Drotbohm, a Staff 2 Engineer at VMware. They explore the essence of maintainable software, pinpointing understandability and modifiability as its foundational pillars. Drawing from Dr. Carola Lilienthal's "Sustainable Software Architecture: Analyze and Reduce Technical Debt," Robby and Oliver dissect the metaphor of technical debt, discussing its historical context and its relevance in today's fast-paced software development environment. </p><p>Their nuanced conversation balanced the need for making compromises with the risk of over-preparation, emphasizing the critical role that clear documentation of architecture design decisions plays. They further delve into the iterative nature of building sustainable software, advocating for a build-feedback-repeat cycle to ensure that the right product is being developed. </p><p>Their discussion pivots to the strategic use of microservices, unpacking the circumstances that justify their implementation and the inherent tradeoffs. An overview of the Modulithic project for Java Spring presents a modern approach to modular software development. They round off with a sneak peek of Oliver's book, "Modulithic Applications with Spring," while also touching upon the inherent challenges of writing technical literature in an industry where change is the only constant.

      <title>Colin Campbell - The Daily Habits of Effective Engineers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Colin Campbell, the Director of Engineering at Tucows. Colin delves into the professional ethos of software development, emphasizing that the caliber of an engineer’s work is a reflection of their daily habits. He stressed the importance of humility for software engineers, arguing that it is crucial for continuous improvement and effective teamwork. He also talked about the strategic approach of doing nothing during Sprint Zero, suggesting that thorough planning and groundwork are essential before diving into actual code deployment.</p><p>The conversation transitions to the practical aspects of the craft, sharing insights from his experience of refactoring the OpenSRS platform at Tucows. Colin expresses a strong stance against total rewrites of systems, except when transitioning to new platforms, advocating for the incremental and strategic improvements using the Strangler Fig pattern. He also describes the satisfaction derived from identifying and rectifying “code smells” through refactoring, underscoring this practice as a source of professional fulfillment. </p><p>Moreover, he provides a glimpse into the life of platform engineers, detailing the intricacies of supporting application developers and the necessity of being decisively focused when addressing specific programming tasks, hence being “ruthless” to the ticket at hand to ensure quality and efficiency.

      <title>Adriana Villela - On Being a Serial Refactorer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Adriana Villela, a Senior Developer Advocate at Lightstep. Adriana highlights that well-maintained software should be software that one can understand when they go into the code even if they’re not super familiar with it.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Cory House (he/him/his), the Founder at Reactjsconsulting.com, a software developer, author, speaker, and consultant. “I love the old saying that we write software for humans. So, I think about that regularly”, Cory says about what the maintainability of software is all about. When it comes down to it, he thinks more about his fellow developers than the compiler. He talks about the importance of good variable naming, shares the tactics for writing good tests for your regular expressions, and lists the benefits of automating pull-request feedback on potentially subjective feedback so that we can focus our attention on objective curiosities. </p><p>He will also dive into testing strategies for React JS applications, how granular unit testing patterns don't apply well to automated browser tests, why it's valuable to keep a running list of opportunities for improvements rather than a list of technical debt, and why he believes that not every software project requires a dedicated architect but there should be someone who is acting in that role.

      <title>Avery Quinn - Can You Quantify the Impact?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Senior Software Engineer, Avery Quinn. Avery was previously a Senior Software Engineer at Remotion.

      <title>Henrik Warne - There is No Software Maintenance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Henrik Warne (he/him/his), the Senior Software Engineer at Talos. In Henrik’s view of well-maintained software, he talks about the importance of code having structure early on because, without structure, code tends to inevitably drift over time toward complexity. He highlights the importance of engineers being able to not only read code when they join a project but also be able to run the code and test it.</p><p>Henrik will share the details of his blog titled, "There is No Software Maintenance," where he argues that software maintenance is simply software development, and how software is better seen as a product versus a project. He will talk about why all software engineers should spend a portion of their time working on bugs, tactics engineers can use to reflect on and capture their thoughts after fixing a bug, and strategies for teams to improve software and avoid rot. Stay tuned for more and enjoy.</p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie</a></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">Helpful Links:</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2023/01/07/there-is-no-software-maintenance/">There is No Software Maintenance By Henrik Warne</a></li><li><a href="https://henrikwarne.com/">Henrik's Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/henrikwarne">Henrik on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrikwarne/">Henrik on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><p><strong>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search <strong>"Maintainable"</strong> wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://hi.planetargon.com/maintainable-newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>Keep up to date with the Maintainable Podcast by joining the newsletter.</strong></a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Noah Clark, a consulting applications developer at Merchants Bonding Company, one the top 15 largest surety writers in the United States. On the top of Noah’s list of things that facilitate the maintainability of software is team dynamics. Well-maintained software can never be achieved by a single individual refactoring code or having grand ideas/visions. It’s made possible by a team coming together and committing to a practice of well-maintained software. He highlights trust and communication between a team and the company they’re developing software for as key. He also advises engineers to avoid writing code just to solve problems.</p><p>Tune in as Robby and Noah discuss why engineers should ensure that their software code leans on the business domain especially when it comes to naming things, how teams can determine when it’s necessary to refactor and/or improve existing software, the complexities that come with basing software development projects on best practices, why and how to avoid blog post driven development, why referring to "organizational debt" might be more effective than "technical debt", and so much more.

      <title>Ben Parisot - Documentation Just Needs To Be Used Once</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with the Engineering Manager at Planet Argon, Ben Parisot. Ben has worked in the tech industry since 2010 and has worn many, many hats: blogger, web designer, web developer, technical producer, scrum master, technical project manager, copywriter, and more. He loves all parts of the software development lifecycle and always has a creative personal web or mobile app humming along outside of work. The first thing Ben says he looks for that represents well-maintained software is thorough and up-to-date documentation. </p><p>He feels that every developer or project manager must ensure that they leave a good paper trail of the work they do. He encourages engineering teams to do regular documentation audits of internal and external documentation they use in order to find outdated and obsolete documentation. Drawing from his experience working on multiple client projects, his advice is to build processes around auditing and improving documentation to make sure it's effective. This convo will prove incredibly valuable as he shares some tips on how engineering teams can go about that based on the projects they work on and so much more.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Stefanni Brasil, the Co-founder and Educator at hexdevs, Co-creator of the Get to Senior online course and community, and most recently joined thoughtbot as a developer. Reflecting on her experience in the industry, Stefanni says that well-maintained software can only be a result of teams agreeing on conventions before coding starts. </p><p>She feels that the term technical debt facilitates better communication and her perspective around it has shifted over time due to the fact that most projects that have employed it are the ones that have been generating revenue. Stefanni notes that software engineering teams can work seamlessly when they document their decisions (on Trello, Google Docs, etc) for future reference. Creating an environment where every team member feels safe and comfortable to speak up about any issues also contributes to project success. </p><p>Steffani will also share her knowledgeable insights on how to be a good guest in another team's codebase as a consultant and the steps to take when onboarding with a new client project. She will dive into her Get to Senior course and highlight all the value that it offers.

      <title>Andrea Goulet - Empathy-Driven Software Development</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Andrea Goulet, the CEO of Corgibytes, a software development shop dedicated to maintaining and modernizing software applications. Named by LinkedIn as one of the top ten professionals in software under 35, Andrea is the host of the podcast Legacy Code Rocks, is the author of the forthcoming book, <i>“Empathy-Driven Software Development”</i>, has co-founded several successful technology companies, and has taught over 50,000 students how to turn soft skills like empathy and communication into software skills.</p><p>Through her newest venture, Heartware.dev, she is on a mission to operationalize empathy for tech teams and keynotes frequently about building a business based on balance, empathy, and trust; the perils of the technical/non-technical divide; and the technical philosophies around working with legacy code. Andrea says that the maintainability of software comes down to trust and while she doesn't find the term technical debt useful, she uses it in instances where it’s being widely used especially in software remodeling projects. From her experience, the term is not useful at all when dealing with business-minded people who view debt differently.</p><p>She points out that the success of a project is always highly dependent on the project owner and the team working on their project having shared goals as they approach the writing of software. Robby and Andrea will also dive into why we should avoid deferring to other people and defaulting to being ticket takers, how empathy has different definitions, avoiding us vs them thinking, and so much more.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, John Ousterhout. John founded Electric Cloud with John Graham-Cumming. Ousterhout was a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley where he created the Tcl scripting language and the Tk platform-independent widget toolkit and proposed the idea of co-scheduling. Ousterhout led the research group that designed the experimental Sprite operating system and the first log-structured file system. Ousterhout also led the team that developed the Magic VLSI computer-aided design (CAD) program.</p><p>When it comes to the maintainability of software, John is more interested in the design aspects of software and feels that indeed the core goal of good software design is to make it easier to maintain software and continually improve it. He explains what problem decomposition is all about and why his course on the art of software design is probably the only one of its kind in the world. </p><p>Join the convo as he also talks about how to write good code comments and why they are so important, the main differences between tactical and strategic programming, how engineers can discuss long-term improvements with their boss, how his curriculum has students approach a project with two different designs before deciding which to proceed with, and so much more.

      <title>Casey Watts! - Culturesmithing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Casey Watts!, the Founder at Happy and Effective and the author of Debugging Your Brain. Their conversation begins with Casey calling out engineers who go about the maintainability of their software by just cleaning stuff up instinctually instead of having a deliberately prioritized engineering backlog. He talks about the importance of team leaders giving engineers leeway to choose when to explore and try things, and even take some free time. That enables the engineers to feel more autonomous and have more ownership. </p><p>Casey also shares strategies for managing technical debt and how teams can invest in moving faster. And on the topic of team culture, he will dig into the concept of culturesmithing and talk about the five levers that can be used to make changes happen, for example, in engineering and prioritization of backlogs. You will get to learn about the service engagements that Happy and Effective offers and gain so much more value in this candid 44-minute conversation that Robby and Casey had.

      <title>Marc Cornellà - Maintaining Open Source Projects</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Marc Cornellà, the official maintainer and major contributor for the Oh My Zsh project. Marc will start off by sharing his wisdom on the characteristics of well-maintained proprietary software. He will also tell us whether the same characteristics apply when it comes to open-source software. Marc started contributing to open-source projects back in 2011 when he worked on a university project that generated schedules for new students. In 2015, he transitioned to Oh My Zsh, which has been the biggest project he’s ever worked on. </p><p>Oh My Zsh is a framework for Z Shell that allows engineers to install and use different themes that one can personalize according to the look and feel of their terminal. It has 200+ plugins and about 100 themes. It not only allows one to use plugins and themes from other projects, but also offers thousands of helpful functions, helpers, and so much more. The great thing about Oh My Zsh is that an engineer doesn't have to be an advanced hacker to use it. </p><p>Marc will among many other things share strategies that can be used to help organize and prioritize a popular project that has a consistent 400 to 500 open pull requests from people across the planet, and some future ideas for Oh My Zsh.

      <title>Shanea Leven - How To Bring Visibility To Your Codebase</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with the CEO and Co-Founder of CodeSee, Shanea Leven. The conversation starts with Shanea’s insights on the relatively unknown shift left movement which, from her own hands-on experience, has been a very great way for engineers to write maintainable and resilient code. The shift left movement emphasizes on moving, understanding, and visualizing code while moving everything closer to development when one is writing their code instead of waiting until things are in production. That has proven to be very helpful as codebases increase in size and complexity because it enables engineers to catch things before they write their code. </p><p>Shanea talks about the importance of code visibility (Being able to visually summarize how your code is working at every step of the development process before production) and how to go about it. She shares how the code visibility movement is helping engineers overcome the challenges they face when they go into legacy codebases to try and refactor them and get them back to their clients in a way that the clients can be able to maintain them. Tune in as Robby and Shanea dive into a lot more juicy topics around managing documentation, how CodeSee offers great value to engineers, tech debt, spatial reasoning, and much more.</p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://cruciallearning.com/crucial-conversations-book/" target="_blank">Crucial Conversations</a></li></ul><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.codesee.io/" target="_blank">Codesee</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.codesee.io/" target="_blank">Codesee Learn</a></li><li><a href="https://opensourcehub.io/" target="_blank">Open Source Hub</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.codesee.io/learn-to-code-smarter-how-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer-quickly/" target="_blank">Blog post discussing spatial reasoning</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ilf05C-hE" target="_blank">Talk including discussion on spatial reasoning </a></li></ul><p><strong>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/u8BwA2kvyu" target="_blank">Join the discussion in the Maintainable Discord Community</a></p>

      <title>Urban Hafner - Management Isn&apos;t For Everyone</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Urban Hafner, a Senior Software Developer at Risk Methods. The episode starts off on a high note with Urban explaining that maintainable software is all about time being spent on looking after one’s code base. While it doesn’t guarantee that a code base will be perfect all the time, Urban insists that it makes things better than when an engineer just develops new features and leaves everything else the same. That ends up causing huge messes that are an uphill task to clean up. </p><p>From his years of experience, he also shares how team attrition negatively affects the maintainability of a code base, the challenges that startups face when the original agency and/or developers depart from their software projects, the importance of measuring your progress on maintenance work to keep the momentum up, and a lot more of his wealth of engineering wisdom. </p><p>The experience he had going from a software engineer to an engineering manager, only to realize that he wasn't a good manager, and then navigating back into an individual contributor role will make for a very interesting story. So don’t miss out.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with the VP of Engineering at ConvertKit, Amy Isikoff Newell. Amy starts off by talking about why perfection is the enemy of software development. There’s no engineer who likes admitting that there are messy bits in their code. They think the messy bits shouldn’t be there, but that's not possible. Amy feels that when it comes to the maintainability of software, it shouldn’t drive an engineer to drink. For her, well-maintained software should be about delivering great value to users with minimal pain points.</p><p>She ends up talking about a lot of skills that are excellent for software engineers as well as managers. She also shares her expertise on career path options for engineers between being an individual contributor and transitioning into management, how managers can reduce drag on their engineering teams by applying a human-focused approach to their management, how technical debt can impact both the recruitment and retention of software engineers, and so much more.</p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.stoneandheen.com/thanks-feedback" target="_blank">Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well By Douglas Stone & Sheila Heen</a></li></ul><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/@amynewell" target="_blank">Amy on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amynewell/" target="_blank">Amy on LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amywriteswords.com/about" target="_blank">Amy’s Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="https://amynewell.com/" target="_blank">Amy’s Website</a></li><li><a href="https://convertkit.com/careers" target="_blank">ConvertKit is HIRING</a></li></ul><p><strong>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/u8BwA2kvyu" target="_blank">Join the discussion in the Maintainable Discord Community</a></p>

      <title>Chelsea Troy - All Code Has Maintenance Load</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Chelsea Troy, the Staff Software Engineer on machine learning and backend systems at Mozilla. Chelsea also maintains the Zooniverse Citizens Science mobile app, the NASA landslide data processing pipeline, and a few other open-source projects. She is a maintainer for the rock programming language and mentors formerly incarcerated technologists through Emergent Works. She teaches Python and mobile development at the University of Chicago’s Master's program in Computer Science, hosts workshops for O’Reilly, and writes at <a href="http://chelseatroy.com">ChelseaTroy.com</a>  </p><p>For Chelsea, one of the most important characteristics of well-maintained software is a conscious effort to ensure that enough context remains available for engineers who come in without existing familiarity with the system to gain that context and maintain it. She shares more of her valuable insights on how we can go about making software more maintainable and explains why she’s not a proponent of the term “Technical debt”. </p><p>She also talks about some of the strategies she uses to quantify maintenance work, how engineers can document their code with more helpful error messages that provide more context, and how to discuss the removal of features to reduce long-term maintenance load with a product team. To learn more, including what you should do when you join a new team with existing software, stay tuned. </p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.biancabosker.com/cork-dork" target="_blank">Cork Dork by Bianca Bosker</a></li></ul><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/HeyChelseaTroy" target="_blank">Chelsea on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="chelseatroy.com" target="_blank">Chelsea’s Website</a></li><li><a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2021/10/29/a-rubric-for-evaluating-team-members-contributions-to-a-maintainable-code-base/">A Rubric for Evaluating Team Members’ Contributions to a Maintainable Code Base</a></li><li><a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2021/01/14/quantifying-technical-debt/">Quantifying Technical Debt</a></li><li><a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2021/01/21/reducing-technical-debt/">Reducing Technical Debt</a></li></ul><p><strong>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/u8BwA2kvyu" target="_blank">Join the discussion in the Maintainable Discord Community</a></p>

      <title>Paula Paul - Getting People To Understand Is a Challenge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Paula Paul, a distinguished engineer with Greyshore Associates, where she helps organizations adopt cloud-native technology and serves the community as an ABI Syster, diversity speaker, and mentor.

She’s had roles in product development, engineering management, consulting, and she’s led several modernization efforts along the way.</p><p>Paula will highlight readability and unit testing as the two most important characteristics of maintainable software, and dive into what legacy code really is, how technical debt has changed over the years, and how the industry underestimates the emotional and mental cost of context-switching. From her many years in the game, Paula will also talk about her long experience of software modernization and share her expertise on why engineers should pay enough attention to cleaning their code as they go, how organizations have to grapple with different challenges due to ineffective technical decision making processes, finding the right balance of automated testing, and so much more.</p><p>For those of you who are trying to figure out what direction to head in where your engineering careers are concerned, Paula will share her wisdom in what it’s like to work in the consulting space versus a product-oriented organization.

      <title>Avdi Grimm - Don&apos;t Be Too Clingy To Your Tests</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a candid conversation with Avdi Grimm, a software developer, consultant, coach, speaker, and author of the books, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confident-Ruby-Patterns-Joyful-Coding-ebook/dp/B00ETE0D2S">“Confident Ruby”</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11799211-exceptional-ruby">“Exceptional Ruby”</a> He is also the creator and head gardener of<a href="https://graceful.dev"> Graceful.Dev</a>. Avdi’s opinion on well-maintained software is that it’s more about teams than code and the fact that more attention need to be paid on documentation. He emphasizes the value of useful commit messages and conveying the why over the how. He also shares examples of executable documentation. </p><p>Robby and Avdi dive into what technical debt looks like for different teams and how it can either be taken as a serious course of action or just as a term for areas of friction in a codebase. Avdi shares his experience in organizing technical debt-type tasks and highlights the importance of teams being able to articulate and quantify friction. As organizations continue to adopt the DevOps mindset, there is lingering debate as to whether it is more of a philosophy or a role. </p><p>Avdi believes that DevOps is less a role and a philosophy, an approach to lifecycle management and how teams are organized around that outlook.

Aran starts off by sharing that great functional decomposition, brevity, and simple but high coverage tests are, from his experience, the three common characteristics of well-maintained software. He then shares his wisdom on the importance of brevity in code and documentation, when and where copy/paste is appropriate, and how to get a better handle on your costs of cloud resources to better predict future utilization and pricing.</p><p>He also shares what problems Archera.ai solves for its customers and how Archera captures, estimates, and prioritizes its own technical debt.

      <title>Shaundai Person: Work on Having a Short-term Memory</title>

      <title>Heidi Waterhouse: Documentation: The Best Diff is a Red Diff</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Maintainable, Robby Russell chats with Heidi Waterhouse, Transformation Advocate at <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a> and contributor to "<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7217-6">Docs for Developers</a>." Heidi shares her insights on the crucial role documentation plays in software maintenance, how to manage documentation debt, and why "the best diff is a red diff."</p><h3>Episode Highlights</h3><ul><li>[00:00:53] <strong>Heidi's Take on Maintainable Software</strong>: Discussing the characteristics of well-maintained software, with a focus on modularity and context-aware decisions.</li><li>[00:02:16] <strong>Documenting Context in Code</strong>: The importance of leaving behind the rationale for past decisions to help future developers understand trade-offs.</li><li>[00:04:09] <strong>Stress vs. Creativity</strong>: The mental firewall between stress-driven fixes and creative problem-solving and how it affects documentation.</li><li>[00:05:53] <strong>Making Documentation a Habit</strong>: Techniques for leaving helpful notes in code and why documenting as you go is crucial.</li><li>[00:07:12] <strong>Documentation Debt</strong>: Exploring the concept of documentation technical debt and how it parallels code technical debt.</li><li>[00:09:49] <strong>Pruning Documentation</strong>: Strategies for regularly reviewing and archiving outdated documentation to keep the signal strong.</li><li>[00:12:02] <strong>Templating Documentation</strong>: How to start documenting without the fear of a blank page using templates and examples.</li><li>[00:14:01] <strong>Where to Document</strong>: Tips on deciding the best place to store documentation and ensuring it is easily accessible.</li><li>[00:18:47] <strong>The Pitfalls of Video Tutorials</strong>: Why video tutorials can be a time bomb and the importance of searchable, updateable documentation.</li><li>[00:21:12] <strong>Starting with Public Speaking</strong>: Heidi's journey into public speaking, starting with anger-driven topics and evolving to educational resources.</li><li>[00:26:26] <strong>Dealing with Rejection in Public Speaking</strong>: The reality of talk proposal rejections and why it's not a reflection of your value as a speaker.</li><li>[00:30:14] <strong>Code Ergonomics</strong>: How the physical layout of code and workspace can affect developer productivity and reduce context switching.</li><li>[00:36:39] <strong>Improving Documentation Culture</strong>: Advice for new team members on finding allies and starting small to improve documentation practices.</li><li>[00:40:15] <strong>Integrating Documentation with Code</strong>: Making documentation part of the code review process and defining it as part of the "done" criteria.</li></ul><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Documentation is a crucial part of maintaining software, and its importance should not be underestimated.</li><li>Regularly pruning and archiving outdated documentation helps keep the information relevant and useful.</li><li>The best way to combat documentation debt is by making documentation an integral part of the development process.</li><li>Public speaking can start small and doesn’t require expertise—passion and personal experiences are powerful drivers.</li></ul><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://heidiwaterhouse.com/">Heidi's Website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/wiredferret">Heidi's Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidiwaterhouse/">Heidi's LinkedIn</a></li><li>Order the new book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7217-6">Docs for Developers</a>, that Heidi is a co-author of</li><li>Blog post: <a href="https://heidiwaterhouse.com/2021/10/04/when-you-stare-into-the-blank-page-it-stares-back-at-you/">When you stare into the blank page, it stares back at you</a></li><li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RlfBdLvE8">Lillian Gilbreth: First Lady of Engineering</a></li></ul><p> </p>

      <title>DHH: Celebrating Legacy Software as a Victory and the Story of How Humans Can&apos;t Estimate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby speaks with David Heinemeier Hansson (aka DHH), Creator of Ruby on Rails and CTO of Basecamp / HEY.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <i>Robby sat down with DHH in early March 2021 about ~5-6 weeks before Basecamp's policy changes were announced and the significant impact that had within our community. It's quite likely that some of Basecamp's internal software engineering processes have since changed.</i></p><p>In an enthralling episode of Maintainable, host Robby is joined by <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (DHH), the original brain behind <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and the CTO of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> & <a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a>. They embark on a deep exploration of the software world, challenging conventional views and celebrating the often underappreciated aspects of software development.</p><p>The discussion kicks off with a refreshing perspective on legacy software. DHH and Robby delve into why legacy software should be celebrated as a victory, a testament to its success and durability in a fast-evolving tech landscape. This sets the stage for a broader conversation about the lifecycle and evolution of software products.</p><p>They then shift gears to Basecamp's approach to versioning their SaaS products. Unlike the common industry trend of continuous iteration on a single version, Basecamp has made strategic choices to release new versions, a decision rooted in their unique business and product philosophy. This leads to an insightful discussion on how Basecamp handles the balance between innovation and maintenance, including the management of security backports and the upkeep of their software.</p><p>DHH introduces listeners to the concept of <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">ShapeUp</a>, Basecamp/HEY's innovative approach to project management. He explains how their team uses two-week cooldown periods to manage bugs and follow-up work, ensuring that the development process remains agile and responsive to emerging needs.</p><p>The conversation also delves into the specialized teams at Basecamp, such as the Security Infrastructure Performance (SIP) team, which plays a crucial role in addressing security concerns and handling reactive work. This is juxtaposed with the Research & Fidelity team's focus on building and extracting frameworks, highlighting the diverse strategies employed to maintain and evolve a robust software environment.</p><p>A significant portion of the discussion revolves around Ruby on Rails. DHH shares why a major rewrite of Rails has never been necessary, attributing it to the framework's solid foundation and continuous improvement. He also sheds light on the types of testing that provide the most value in their Ruby on Rails applications and offers a candid take on Test-Driven Development (TDD).</p><p>Finally, DHH and Robby discuss the importance of budgeting time and resources in software projects, contrasting it with traditional estimating methods. They conclude with a discussion on the competitive advantage of Ruby on Rails in the current technology landscape and why it's perfectly fine that Rails isn't always the center of tech conversations anymore.</p><p>Book Recommendation: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Philosophers-Guide-Life/dp/1545461112">"The Manual" by Epictetus</a></p><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh">DHH on Hey</a></li><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a></li><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a></li><li><a href="http://hey.com/">HEY</a></li><li><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/dhh">DHH on Github</a></li></ul><h2>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p>

      <title>Bertold Kolics: Are You Carrying the Weight of Dead Code?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <i>Maintainable</i>, Robby Russell sits down with Bertold Kolics, Software Quality Manager at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertold/">mabl</a>, to discuss the critical role of automated testing, the challenges of maintaining legacy code, and the art of pruning dead code from your software projects. With a focus on enabling teams and fostering maintainable software, Bertold provides practical insights into how developers and testers can work together to keep codebases lean, healthy, and efficient.</p><h3>Episode Highlights</h3><ul><li><strong>[00:05:32]</strong> <strong>Automated Testing as Documentation:</strong> Bertold emphasizes the importance of automated tests in documenting application behavior, making them a crucial tool in maintaining a clean and well-functioning codebase.</li><li><strong>[00:12:33]</strong> <strong>Dead Code and Code Pruning:</strong> Explore Bertold's analogy of carrying the extra weight of unused features and dead code, and why it’s essential to prune your software regularly to maintain its health.</li><li><strong>[00:21:24]</strong> <strong>Third-Party Dependencies and Risks:</strong> Discussion on the risks associated with third-party libraries and APIs, and how to manage them effectively to avoid unexpected technical debt.</li><li><strong>[00:29:09]</strong> <strong>Contextual Decision-Making:</strong> Bertold shares insights on why copying processes from other companies, like Spotify’s squad model, doesn’t always work and the importance of context in decision-making.</li><li><strong>[00:36:00]</strong> <strong>Contributing Back to Open Source:</strong> Advice on the importance of contributing back to open-source projects that your company relies on, whether through code contributions or financial support.</li><li><strong>[00:41:02]</strong> <strong>Running Internship Programs:</strong> Bertold discusses the value of integrating interns into real projects and how it benefits both the interns and the existing team.</li><li><strong>[00:49:00]</strong> <strong>Starting with Automated Testing:</strong> Practical advice for developers in teams lacking comprehensive test suites, with tips on how to begin implementing automated testing effectively.</li></ul><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li><strong>The Power of Automated Tests:</strong> Automated tests don’t just verify code; they serve as living documentation, reducing the need for constantly updated documentation files.</li><li><strong>Prune Your Code Regularly:</strong> Just like a garden, your codebase needs regular pruning to remove outdated or unused features, which can otherwise become a burden.</li><li><strong>Manage Third-Party Dependencies Carefully:</strong> Every third-party component adds potential risk.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Maintainable Software Podcast, Robby is joined by Sandi Metz, a renowned programmer, author, and speaker known for her expertise in object-oriented programming and maintainable code. Sandi shares her invaluable insights on various aspects of software development, focusing on writing code that stands the test of time.</p><h2>Episode Highlights</h2><ul><li><strong>Maintaining Readable Code</strong>: Sandi emphasizes that the cost of software lies in its readability. She discusses the importance of writing code with good names and gentle organization, making it easier for future developers to understand.</li><li><strong>Avoiding Clever Code</strong>: Sandi warns against writing overly clever code that even the author might not understand later. Instead, she advocates for clear and simple code that conveys the programmer's good intentions to future readers.</li><li><strong>Documentation and Integration Tests</strong>: While Sandi believes in minimal documentation at the object level, she stresses the importance of integration tests and visual aids that show how everything fits together.</li><li><strong>Common Legacy Code Issues</strong>: Sandi identifies common patterns of problematic code in legacy systems, often resulting from neglected complexity and social bargains within teams that lead to unwieldy classes and procedures.</li><li><strong>Technical Debt vs. Bad Code</strong>: She discusses the nuanced difference between technical debt and bad code, emphasizing the need for shared language and understanding between developers and stakeholders.</li><li><strong>Training and Education</strong>: Sandi reflects on the importance of proper training for developers and how educational institutions might better prepare students for the real-world challenges of maintaining existing codebases.</li><li><strong>Small Pieces, Big Impact</strong>: Advocating for the creation of small, manageable pieces of code, Sandi explains how this approach simplifies maintenance and enhances code readability.</li><li><strong>Refactoring Strategies</strong>: Sandi shares strategies for refactoring large classes and objects, often seen in Rails applications, and the benefits of creating service objects and other intermediary classes.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Framework Viability</strong>: Sandi discusses the future of frameworks like Rails, the importance of not being overly reliant on them, and preparing for potential technological shifts.</li></ul><p>You'll also hear some thoughts on Ruby and Rails and how Sandi uses the phrase <i>"Lambs to the Slaughter."</i></p><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandi-metz-0932a84b/">Sandi Metz's LinkedIn</a></li><li>Follow Sandi <a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz">on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> by Michael Feathers</li><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a> by Martin Fowler</li><li><a href="https://codedevotional.com/">CodeDevotional project</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134456475/">Practical Object-Oriented Design</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles">99 Bottles</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/">sandimetz.com</a></li><li>[Book] <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/194564401X">Elements of Style</a> by William Strunk Jr.</li></ul><p>Tune in to this insightful episode and learn from one of the best in the industry about writing maintainable software that your future self will thank you for!</p>

      <title>Ernesto Tagwerker: Tracking Technical Debt With Metrics (aka Stink Score)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the latest episode of Maintainable, we're joined by Ernesto Tagwerker, Founder and CTO of OmbuLabs. This isn't just another podcast episode; it's a deep dive into the world of technical debt and Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Ernesto starts by demystifying technical debt – it's more than just a buzzword; it's a real challenge that can turn your project into a Tar Pit. And, believe it or not, there are actual tools to measure this. We explore these tools and how they can help identify technical debt and communicate the progress of tackling it.</p><p>Then, we get into the juicy part: Ruby on Rails upgrades. Ernesto shares the strategies his team at <a href="https://www.ombulabs.com/">OmbuLabs</a> uses to help clients with these upgrades. And I, Robby, chime in with how we handle similar challenges at <a href="https://www.planetargon.com/">Planet Argon</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the latest episode of Maintainable, we're joined by Ernesto Tagwerker, Founder and CTO of OmbuLabs. This isn't just another podcast episode; it's a deep dive into the world of technical debt and Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Ernesto starts by demystifying technical debt – it's more than just a buzzword; it's a real challenge that can turn your project into a Tar Pit. And, believe it or not, there are actual tools to measure this. We explore these tools and how they can help identify technical debt and communicate the progress of tackling it.</p><p>Then, we get into the juicy part: Ruby on Rails upgrades. Ernesto shares the strategies his team at <a href="https://www.ombulabs.com/">OmbuLabs</a> uses to help clients with these upgrades. And I, Robby, chime in with how we handle similar challenges at <a href="https://www.planetargon.com/">Planet Argon</a>. It's like getting insights from two different angles on the same tricky problem!</p><p>We also touch on recruiting consultant-minded developers, hiring junior devs, and what senior developers should aim for in mentoring.

      <title>Michael Feathers: Be Curious &amp; Chase The Rabbit Holes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Maintainable Software Podcast, Robby speaks with Michael Feathers, Director at R7K Research & Conveyance and author of "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code" target="_blank">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>." Michael shares his unique definition of legacy code, emphasizing that legacy code is essentially code without tests. This foundational idea highlights the critical role of automated testing in refactoring and maintaining codebases.</p><p>Michael and Robby dive into common issues developers face, such as low test coverage and the perceived optionality of writing tests. They explore how ego and human nature often influence developers' decisions not to write tests, even when frameworks provide the tools to do so.</p><p>One of the intriguing concepts discussed is a test-first IDE, which encourages writing tests before methods. Michael shares patterns and practices for integrating testing into existing projects, emphasizing the importance of social reinforcement and team collaboration in improving test coverage.</p><p>The conversation also touches on the importance of code quality traits like understandability and simplicity. Michael stresses that empathy in code quality impacts co-workers and that objective measures for code quality often stem from solid design principles. They also discuss the role of code analysis tools in understanding code quality.</p><p>Removing unused code from applications is another key topic, with Michael sharing insights on the relationship between business decisions and code maintenance. The discussion extends to Conway's Law and its effect on code design, providing valuable context for understanding how organizational structure influences software development.</p><p>Michael shares lessons from his early career, emphasizing the importance of curiosity and deep systems thinking in software development.

      <title>Nate Berkopec: Why You Should Treat Performance Problems as Bugs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Please tune in to this enlightening episode of Maintainable, where we're joined by Nate Berkopec, Owner and Ruby on Rails consultant at Speedshop. This episode is a deep dive into the world of software performance, specifically honing in on Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Nate kicks things off by walking us through the intricacies of measuring software performance. It's not just about numbers; it's an art and science, especially in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem. He shares his insights and experiences, making this complex topic accessible and engaging.</p><p>But wait, there's more! We also delve into the murky waters of modern JavaScript frameworks. Nate uncovers some unanticipated problems that these frameworks can bring to the table. It's an eye-opener for anyone who's ever been dazzled by the latest and greatest in JavaScript land.</p><p>One of the juiciest parts of our discussion revolves around how teams assess the value of performance optimization. It's not always about speed; sometimes, it's about the value it brings to the table. And here's a thought-provoking twist: Nate suggests we start looking at performance problems as bugs.
