  <description><![CDATA[<p>Alberta Wildfire is the fire management agency of the province of Alberta, Canada. With recent fire seasons growing longer and more intense, the agency has been looking to technology to help them&nbsp;be more&nbsp;strategic in how they allocate firefighters and equipment.&nbsp;â</p><p>â</p><p>In 2022, they began&nbsp;using an AI-powered tool that provides duty officers with data-driven insights for their decisions. Built by&nbsp;AltaML, an AI&nbsp;startup in Edmonton, Alberta, the tool leverages machine learning to analyze tens of thousands of data points and&nbsp;predict where new fires are likely to&nbsp;pop up&nbsp;the next&nbsp;day. This gives firefighters a head start in&nbsp;taking action to suppress&nbsp;burn conditions.â</p><p>â</p><p>In this episode, we hear from provincial wildfire management specialist Ed Trenchard, and AltaMLâs Graham Erickson, as they describe how AI is helping Alberta Wildfire control wildfires and save lives.â</p><p>â</p><p>Their story offers a vivid example of how&nbsp;AI can help&nbsp;solve public sector problems, augment the skills of experts, and deliver better outcomes&nbsp;for communities around the world.&nbsp;â</p><p><br></p><p>Link to full&nbsp;<a href="https://pivotal-with-hayete-gallot.cohostpodcasting.com/episodes/how-alberta-wildfire-uses-ai-to-suppress-fires-and-save-lives" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(72, 95, 199);">episode transcript</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.larjmedia.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(72, 95, 199);">Larj Media</a>.</p>]]></description>
