      <itunes:summary>This week on The Data Stack Show, Eric and John chat with Jesse Clark, the Co-Founder &amp; CTO of Marqo.ai. During the episode, Jesse discusses the evolution of AI and machine learning in enhancing search capabilities, particularly in e-commerce. The group explores the concept of vector search and its advantages over traditional keyword-based methods. The conversation also touches on the challenges of searching for specific items, like car parts for Land Cruisers in Australia, due to the complexity of part numbers and interchangeability. They delve into the difficulties of dealing with unstructured data, such as information locked in PDFs and manuals, and how Marqo is developing AI to search and incorporate this data into relevant results. The episode covers the technical aspects of customizing embedding and language models for better search outcomes and the potential of language models to connect different data modalities for advanced search experiences, the future of interfaces, the role of new technology in search experiences, and more.</itunes:summary>

The episode covers the technical aspects of customizing embedding and language models for better search outcomes and the potential of language models to connect different data modalities for advanced search experiences, the future of interfaces, the role of new technology in search experiences, and more.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:summary>This week on The Data Stack Show, Eric and Kostas chat with Ryan Blue, the Co-Founder and CEO of Tabular, and also creator of Iceberg and former Cloudera and Netflix employee. During the episode, Ryan discusses the challenges of managing large-scale data and the development of Iceberg, a new table format. He explains Iceberg&apos;s benefits, such as automatic partitioning and improved metadata management, which simplify data engineers&apos; tasks and enhance query performance. The conversation covers the importance of atomicity in analytics systems, the scalability of Iceberg, and the trade-offs in mixed workload environments. Additionally, Ryan addresses the differences in cloud object storage performance and the integration of security and access controls into distributed file systems. He also touches on recent Iceberg updates, including Python and Rust support, the anticipation of view support in the upcoming release, and more. </itunes:summary>

During the conversation, the group chats about the importance of open standards and APIs for efficient interoperability in data management systems, the evolution of data workloads, the need for specialization, and the challenges in building composable components. The conversation also covered the significance of an intermediate representation (IR) for decoupling various layers of data systems, the complexities of data types, and the desire for more secure data sharing methods. The panelists explored the evolution of open standards and the trade-offs between composable and monolithic systems, expressing excitement about new data infrastructure projects and technologies, modular execution engines, new query interfaces, standardizing policy decisions across different data management platforms, and more. </itunes:summary>
