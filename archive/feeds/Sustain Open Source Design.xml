Panelist
Django Skorupa
Show Notes
In this episode of Sustain Open Source Design, Django Skorupa is joined by guest Tofus Wang, a UX designer and open source enthusiast from Taipei. Tofus shares his journey into open source, which began during his high school years. Currently, he is a junior UX designer at National Taiwan University, where he also studies economics. Tofus discusses the g0v (GovZero)  hackathons, the challenges and opportunities of contributing to open source as a designer, and how non-coders contribute in meaningful ways. Press download now to hear more! 
[00:06:11] Django and Tofus discuss how contributions in open source design are often harder to track on platforms like GitHub, but they are equally important, and many g0v participants are not coders but contribute in significant ways. He also explains using HackMD, a note taking platform. 
[00:12:13] Tofus reflects on his contributions as a high school student, participating in g0v School001 project, which promotes hackathons and the spirit of civic hacking to high school students in Taiwan. 
[00:14:53] Tofus discusses his participation in Da0, a study group exploring decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Although not fully developed, the project brought together people interested in blockchain and its potential applications for grassroots communities. 
[00:17:30] Tofus highlights the vital role of design in open source. He worked on visual design projects for multiple initiatives, including creating an interactive UI for Da0’s reputation accounting system.
[00:19:54] Django and Tofus dive into projects such as the Plurality Book, an open source book exploring the future of democracy and technology. Tofus worked on the visual design for the book and helped refine its logo. 
Quotes
[00:22:39] “The fundamental technology of digital technology is actually the collaborations of the people.”
Spotlight
[00:23:26] Tofus’s spotlight is a project he’s working on called, Open 165, a sub-project under Cofacts.

Show Notes
In this episode of Sustain Open Source Design, host Richard Littauer and co-host Memo Esparza are joined by Milan Guenther, President of the Intersection Group and co-founder of Enterprise Design Associates. Milan discusses his career, which spans working with major enterprises like Google and Toyota, and his focus on transforming organizations through enterprise design. The conversation delves into the intricacies of enterprise design, the role of open-source tools like 'Edgy,' and the challenges and successes of applying these concepts in both large and small teams. Milan also highlights the importance of visualizing and uncovering enterprise misalignments and touches on the intersection of various design disciplines. Additionally, the upcoming conference in Rome is discussed, promising further insights into the world of enterprise design. Press download to hear more! 
[00:01:57] Milan mentions his past venture in designing a patented innovation for flight decks, his current work with enterprises like Google, SAP, and Toyota, and his entry into consultancy with friends in 2009.
[00:03:29] Milan shares his perspective on design, emphasizing the role of creativity and making improvements through observing and modeling. 
[00:04:25] Memo asks Milan about his proximity to the term “business design” and how his work might be diagrammatically represented, alongside discussing the dynamics between small and large teams within enterprises. Milan explains the concept of business design, enterprise design, and their differences, and mentions “Team Topologies” as a useful framework for organizational design. 
[00:10:09] Memo inquires about successful patterns in team dynamics, whether structured methods like Scrum or more flexible approaches yield better outcomes in different contexts. Milan responds, emphasizing the effectiveness of smaller, less structured teams in software development. 
[00:12:36] Richard mentions Milan’s book on design patterns in enterprises and asks about the Edgy project. He explains the origins of Edgy, starting with a book titled “Intersection,” which was an introduction to designing better enterprises. Edgy was make open source hosted on a wiki, and licensed under Creative Commons to ensure it was accessible for both personal and commercial use. 
[00:16:02] In response to Memo’s inquiry about the artifacts used in their processes, Milan describes diverse tools utilized depending on the user’s background and needs.
[00:18:14] Richard is curious about the adoption and contribution to Edgy and Milan shares that while there’s been significant use among consultants and some large organizations, there are also instances of failed trials. 
[00:20:19] Discussing smaller, open-source minded projects, Milan mentions the integration of Edgy with the Archi tool, an open source architecture modelling tool. 
[00:23:33] Milan clarifies that the Rome event takes place in Rome, Italy in September, marking the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of their conference on enterprise design. He describes the event as a gathering for discussing and sharing ideas about enterprise design.
[00:24:56] Discussing the sustainability of the Edgy project, Milan explains that while the project itself doesn’t generate direct revenue, it supports their consultancy through connections, collaborations, and the adoption of their work. He provides insights into how the non-profit association supporting Edgy operates.

In today’s episode, we are joined by guest, Veethika Mishra, a Senior Product Designer at GitLab, who shares her career path, emphasizing her move from closed to open source design work.  She shares valuable insights into the design process at GitLab, which involves continuous interaction between designers and product managers and active participation of the user community.  We discuss the power of open source contributions, the importance of community engagement, and the challenges faced in integrating external designers.  Go ahead and download this episode now to hear more! 
[00:02:37] Veethika discusses her career path and transition from a secretive and proprietary organization to open source companies like Red Hat and GitLab. 
[00:04:25] At Red Hat, Veethika was part of the team that worked on the landing page for the developer console of OpenShift, which she greatly enjoyed. However, she wanted more engagement with the open source community, leading her to GitLab. 
[00:06:10] Richard asks Veethika about any potential advantages of design in a closed source environment, and she responds that she doesn’t miss anything from her time in such an environment and considers some practices within these companies as absurd. 
[00:08:03] Django asks Veethika to talk about her research experiences, and she explains that research in an open environment provides a more accessible and authentic dataset, which benefits the product design process.
[00:11:15] We hear about Veethika’s GitLab’s experience and the continuous learning process to ensure valuable community contributions.  
[00:13:29] Richard asks about the user base and the number of designers at GitLab, which Veethika reveals they have 30 million+ users, four designers in the CI/CD UX, and possible over 30 designers across the company.
[00:14:05] Discussing the integration of designer input within developer teams at GitLab, Veethika describes GitLab’s publicly documented product development flow. 
[00:16:19] Victory questions the collaboration between volunteer and employed designers at GitLab, and Veethika explains that while most designers working on different problems are GitLab employees, there are contribution guidelines for UX. She also mentions GitLab’s Pajamas Design System as a more accessible and familiar space for designers to make contributions. 
[00:20:12] Richard asks about handling the potential backlash from unpopular design decisions. Veethika responds that there’s no guaranteed way to mitigate such reactions but mentions that engaging with the community has made her a better communicator and designer.
[00:21:03] We hear about the types of design contributions GitLab encourages from the community as Veethika explains the flexibility in contributions to Pajamas, and she details the process of making contributions via the Web IDE on the Pajamas website. 
[00:22:46] Richard asks about the barriers to open source design roles and how to overcome them. Veethika shares her opinion that the main barrier is the lack of open source ethos within many organizations.
[00:25:19] Django asks if the scenario has changed over the years regarding open source design roles and Veethika notes an improvement in designer participation in open source. 
[00:26:45] Veethika tells us her views on Penpot Fest. 
[00:27:32] Veethika shares her hopes for the future of open source design, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the socio-political impact of technological decisions and the diversification of the open source community.

Quotes
[00:10:17] “When you combine open and when you make it more visible and discoverable for others to see, these two things combined make a lot of impact.”
[00:23:06] “If an organization isn’t practicing open source development methods, then they have no reason having a designer that really cares for open source.” 
[00:23:16] “It’s only when they live this ethos of openness when they realize the scale of impact this can bring to their business, not just to the community.”
[00:24:51] “We can keep pointing fingers at others and not realize that it’s also us who have a certain obligation towards the society and it’s larger good, and open source is the only way to make it happen at this point.”
[00:27:04] “Penpot Fest was really different!”
[00:28:39] “We need to diversify the community that’s behind open source projects.”

Show Notes
Welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! In this episode, we are live from Penpot Fest in Barcelona, Spain.  Pia, Eriol, Victory, and Perrie are hosting, and they’ll be interviewing  three guests. Our guests joining us today are Alonso Torres, a Front-end Developer at Penpot, Máirín Duffy, a Senior Principal Interaction Designer at Red Hat, and Martin Owens, an Independent Free Software Developer at Inkscape. We’ll start with Alonso where we explore the origin of Penpot as a personal innovation project within Kaleidos, and the importance of workflows, community involvement, and Penpot as an alternative to proprietary tools like Figma are highlighted.  Then we shift focus to Máirín, where she explains the concept of designing upstream in open source, she shares the benefits of open source tooling, she talks about her current project Podman Desktop, and the evolution of the community design team and how they collaborate with different open source projects. The episode concludes with Martin, who fills us in on being an Independent Developer at Inkscape, he shares his experiment of funding open source development, dives into the influence of companies on open source projects and discusses measuring impact, and the significance of relationships within the open source community.

Alonso:
[00:01:04] Pia interviews our first guest, Alonso Torres, who shares his role and responsibilities at Penpot and what attracted him to Penpot, and highlights Kaleidos.  
[00:02:38] Alonso emphasizes that workflows are crucial for Penpot’s team, especially when considering how the tool will be used by distributed teams. 
[00:04:17] Alonso clarifies that Penpot is not a direct competitor to Figma but rather an open source alternative, and they prioritize features based on community feedback and needs. 
[00:05:22] The majority of core contributors at Penpot are employed by Kaleidos, and they follow agile methodologies, work collaboratively, and have regular meetings to discuss design handoffs and prioritize features.
[00:07:21] Alonso acknowledges that collaboration between designers and developers can be challenging, especially in open source projects. He suggests using tools for effective communication and mentions the need for improvement in this area.
[00:08:37] Alonso expresses his excitement about being at the festival and highlights the impressive organization and diverse communities present. 
Máirín:
[00:10:25] Eriol interviews our next guest, Máirín Duffy, who discusses her role at Red Hat and the concept of designing upstream in open source. 
[00:13:10] Máirín explains the concepts of upstream and patching in open source, using analogies and examples to make them more accessible to designers unfamiliar with the terminology. 
[00:16:22] We hear about the evolution of the community design team and how they expanded their services to collaborate with different open source projects, fostering user-centered design and bridging gaps between projects that might be competitors in a company context.
[00:18:51] Máirín shares an example of collaboration between Podman and Podman Desktop teams at Red Hat, highlighting the value of bringing end-user use cases and perspectives to the development process and how it benefits both teams. 
[00:21:48] Máirín advises designers not to worry about dogma and encourages them to be open to the practical reasons for adopting open source tools. 
[00:24:06] What’s been the highlight of Penpot for Máirín? She mentions Martin Owen’s talk on the SVG standard and the proposal for a separate editable SVG standard. 
Martin:
[00:26:02] Victory and Perrie interview our third guest, Martin Owen, an Independent Inkscape Developer, and a free software advocate. He shares his interest in finding practical solutions that enable freedom in software development without compromising the path to achieving it and explains an experiment he’s been running.
[00:26:50] He explains his experiment of not taking private proprietary software contracts but instead seeking direct funding from designers and users of Inkscape. Martin discusses how companies that pay for open source software development have a significant influence on feature choices and decisions.
[00:29:23] Martin explains his three main groups of clients. 
[00:30:43] Martin addresses the challenge of prioritizing user requests. 
[00:32:26] Victory asks Martin to highlight any lesser known Inkscape features, and he mentions exploring the extensions and python-based functionalities and watching video tutorials on YouTube.
[00:33:34] Martin mentions that tracking metrics is not a priority for the Inkscape project, but he gauges impact through millions of downloads, positive feedback, and seeing the artwork created by users. 
[00:34:26] If you’re interested in looking at Martin’s work you can go to his YouTube account for videos and you can help fund his work on Patreon. 
[00:34:53] Martin emphasizes the importance of relationships within the open source community and suggests that developers form connections with non-programmers to better understand their needs and the impact of their work.

Show Notes
Welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! In this second part of a series of podcasts about the user work,  Eriol is joined by Katie Wilson and Meag Doherty to discuss their project, Superbloom, which delves into design and usability in scientific and research open source software. Today, they shed light into the ideal user type of open source software tools, the focus on software maintainability in design, and how software complexity plays into its perceived value in decision-making, and how it may impact the progress of open science.  They also discuss the necessity of usability in decision-making, and how it may impact the progress of open science, and they highlight their experiences at various events and initiatives that underscore the importance of continuing conversations around these topics. Hit download now to hear more! 
[00:01:14] Katie Wilson, a Design Researcher at Superbloom and Meag Doherty, the Deputy Chief User Experience Officer at the All of Us Research Program, introduce themselves and we’ll hear what their relationship is to the project.
[00:04:17] Eriol introduces the topic of end users and discusses the discovery that most open source software tools, including those in scientific and research domains, seem to have an ideal user type with particular skills and capabilities.  
[00:07:05] Katie continues the conversation, mentioning that when asked about design, many open source software projects focus on making the software as maintainable and contributable as possible, thus often perceiving the users as fellow programmers or contributors.
[00:09:25] Eriol shares one last thought on the usability chapter and comments on how complexity in scientific and research open source software could be viewed as a safety aspect that validates their relevance in the field. 
[00:11:30] Meag segues to the potential impact of these findings.  She emphasizes that usability is not an afterthought but central to the decision-making process, and poor usability could hinder the progress of open science.
[00:12:59] Katie addresses UX best practices in the context of scientific software, suggesting that the tool’s complexity might dictate its user experience. 
[00:14:52] Eriol talks about accessibility. They explain that designers view accessibility from a different perspective that scientists or researchers in the open source software space. However, for non-designers, accessibility is understood, as broadening the tool’s application and potential discovery of science and research. 
[00:19:21] The conversation shifts to Meag talking about incentives, particularly within university settings and academic groups.  She stresses the importance of understanding incentives and looking for windows of opportunity to implement usability improvements. 
[00:20:13] Eriol describes some work done by their colleagues, who created a series of informative zines distilling complex research findings into six-page summaries.
[00:22:50] Katie discusses an ecosystem map they developed to visualize interconnected projects, institutions, and contributors within the scientific and research open-source software space. 
[00:24:15] Meag talks about a trip to an open source science retreat in Germany where the focus was on the usability of software used by research software engineers daily. She also mentions more of their work was shared at the Software Sustainability Institute’s Collaboration Workshop and at JupyterCon 2023 in Paris. 
[00:27:24] Eriol affirms the importance of welcoming new people into the space to sustain and improve usability design, highlighting the need to include people from the peripheries of science, research, and open source.
Spotlight
[00:29:21] Eriol’s spotlight is a project funded by the Vermont Complex Systems that was a series of weekly designer diary studies that designers did over 10 weeks that they coordinated at Superbloom.
[00:30:25] Meag’s spotlight is The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy that has taken big steps to do listening sessions.
[00:31:08] Katie’s spotlight is the project, AutSPACEs, a platform where autistic people can report their experiences on sensory processing differences in everyday life.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Our guest today is Isaac Zara, an open source enthusiast who works at Flipside as a brand designer. Isaac shares his journey into open source, his work as a brand experience designer, his experience mentoring designers in open source projects, and his design philosophy. He also gives us a glimpse of what’s next for him which includes personal branding projects and how he plans to integrate storytelling into brand designs. Hit download to learn much more!
[00:02:51] Isaac tells us why he considers himself a designer first, a human second, and an open source designer third.
[00:03:35] We hear Isaac’s journey through open source and how he got started.
[00:06:00] Isaac was on the design committee for Drupal, and we find out what he designed for them.
[00:07:34] At Flipside, Isaac works as a brand designer, building the brand identity and making the visual assets cohesive across all marketing channels. 
[00:08:54] We learn about the community being quite different in the Web3 space, using VLC, and how he feels we need more people with this open source beauty mentality in Web3.
[00:10:57] Isaac emphasizes the importance of building a brand system that will stand the test of time, which involves developing an identity that is timeless and consistent with the brand’s values. Also, he notes that open source projects can only stand the test of time with the support of a community and a process that makes it easier for people to take over where the designer leaves off. 
[00:14:21] As a brand designer, he talks about the importance of creating brand guidelines for open source projects to maintain consistency in visual design and recommends making the brand guidelines accessible to everyone involved in the project.
[00:16:20] Isaac discusses the role of design in attracting new users and contributors to open source projects. 
[00:18:32] We hear the role of design in attracting new users and contributors to open source projects. 
[00:22:25] Isaac explains the way to sell a product is by communicating the value to people out there and the importance of creating a visually appealing pitch to investors. He also brings up CHAOSS, CHAOSS Africa, and Ruth Ikegah.
[00:26:42] While Isaac hasn’t specifically worked on open source projects looking for financial contributions, he notes that it’s important to make funding accessible and easy to navigate on the project’s website to encourage financial support. 
[00:28:14] We hear about his experience mentoring others in open source projects and his approach to design. 
[00:29:02] What’s hard for Isaac about design in open source? 
[00:31:11] We hear what’s next for Isaac, such as his personal branding projects and how he wants to incorporate storytelling into his brand designs.
[00:32:09] Find out where you can follow Isaac on the web.
Quotes
[00:03:09] “What gave me the privilege to contribute to open source because I had a design skill.”
[00:14:30] “Devs call it documentation, we call it brand guidelines.”
[00:17:04] “It’s hard to create something that will be cohesive if there’s no guide. Just imagine when you walk into an open forest without a compass.”

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Our guest today is Isaac Zara, an open source enthusiast who works at Flipside as a brand designer. Isaac shares his journey into open source, his work as a brand experience designer, his experience mentoring designers in open source projects, and his design philosophy. He also gives us a glimpse of what’s next for him which includes personal branding projects and how he plans to integrate storytelling into brand designs. Hit download to learn much more!</p>

<p>[00:02:51] Isaac tells us why he considers himself a designer first, a human second, and an open source designer third.</p>

<p>[00:03:35] We hear Isaac’s journey through open source and how he got started.</p>

<p>[00:06:00] Isaac was on the design committee for Drupal, and we find out what he designed for them.</p>

<p>[00:07:34] At Flipside, Isaac works as a brand designer, building the brand identity and making the visual assets cohesive across all marketing channels. </p>

<p>[00:08:54] We learn about the community being quite different in the Web3 space, using VLC, and how he feels we need more people with this open source beauty mentality in Web3.</p>

<p>[00:10:57] Isaac emphasizes the importance of building a brand system that will stand the test of time, which involves developing an identity that is timeless and consistent with the brand’s values. Also, he notes that open source projects can only stand the test of time with the support of a community and a process that makes it easier for people to take over where the designer leaves off. </p>

<p>[00:14:21] As a brand designer, he talks about the importance of creating brand guidelines for open source projects to maintain consistency in visual design and recommends making the brand guidelines accessible to everyone involved in the project.</p>

<p>[00:16:20] Isaac discusses the role of design in attracting new users and contributors to open source projects. </p>

<p>[00:18:32] We hear the role of design in attracting new users and contributors to open source projects. </p>

<p>[00:22:25] Isaac explains the way to sell a product is by communicating the value to people out there and the importance of creating a visually appealing pitch to investors. He also brings up CHAOSS, CHAOSS Africa, and Ruth Ikegah.</p>

<p>[00:26:42] While Isaac hasn’t specifically worked on open source projects looking for financial contributions, he notes that it’s important to make funding accessible and easy to navigate on the project’s website to encourage financial support. </p>

<p>[00:28:14] We hear about his experience mentoring others in open source projects and his approach to design. </p>

<p>[00:29:02] What’s hard for Isaac about design in open source? </p>

<p>[00:31:11] We hear what’s next for Isaac, such as his personal branding projects and how he wants to incorporate storytelling into his brand designs.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:03:09] “What gave me the privilege to contribute to open source because I had a design skill.”</p>

<p>[00:14:30] “Devs call it documentation, we call it brand guidelines.”</p>

<p>[00:17:04] “It’s hard to create something that will be cohesive if there’s no guide. Just imagine when you walk into an open forest without a compass.”</p>

<p>[00:21:07] “It can be hard to translate your greatness you have within you, if they’re not seeing you speak visually.”</p>

<p>[00:22:45] “As a brand designer, I see myself as a value maker, as an innovator.”</p>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We’re excited to have as our guest, Pablo Ruiz Múzquiz, CEO of Kaleidos, and creator of Penpot and Taiga.  Today, Pablo dives into the challenges of leading a creative business in the open source world, focusing on the need for a perfect open source product, an engaged community, and a sustainable business model. He sheds light on the collaborative and contribution-based model at Kaleidos. Also, there’s a conversation about the future of Penpot and its community, and Pablo shares insights about the upcoming Penpot Fest in Barcelona, and he mentions some upcoming features for Penpot.  Download this episode now to hear more!  
[00:01:36] Pablo tells us how it is to lead a company like Kaleidos. 
[00:03:47] He highlights the importance of autonomy and co-ownership within teams. 
[00:06:07] Pablo describes the collaborative and contribution-based model at Kaleidos. He touches on the evolution of the company’s culture, strong opinions, relevant consensus, and the continuous process of redefining themselves. 
[00:09:18] In regard to challenges he faced building Penpot, Pablo emphasizes not taking shortcuts and staying true to their values, using accessibility as an example.  He also tells us they explore the cultural aspects of Kaleidos, the privilege they enjoy in taking risks, and the commitment to their principles and values. 
[00:12:21] There’s a conversation on the work that goes into achieving accessibility in Pablo’s design tool, Taiga.
[00:15:00] Memo wonders what’s next for Penpot and Taiga, and Pablo mentions the upcoming Penpot Fest in Barcelona, where open source communities will join forces to discuss the future design and development using open source and open standards. He also talks about the upcoming features for Penpot, as well as the integration of Taiga into Penpot. 
[00:20:23] Pablo highlights the significance of versioning and sharing knowledge with the open source mindset. 
[00:22:35] Pablo acknowledges the challenges of balancing abundant content and true accessibility and emphasizes the need for powerful design that empowers designers, and he shares what it takes to be a designer.  
[00:28:11] He expresses the importance of cracking the relationship between designers and developers to grow the Penpot community organically, with the ultimate goal of having a strong user base and active contributors.  
Quotes
[00:04:17] “When people work together and are generous with their talent and time, great things happen, open source is just one of those implementations.”
[00:09:52] “The toughest thing to do is not taking shortcuts.”
[00:13:19] “This is not an afterthought, this is not a patch, this is part of a better product.”
[00:14:47] “Look for where there are no incentives, and you’ll probably find a better product to build.”
[00:24:07] “Design is where technology meets society.”

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We’re excited to have as our guest, Pablo Ruiz Múzquiz, CEO of Kaleidos, and creator of Penpot and Taiga.  Today, Pablo dives into the challenges of leading a creative business in the open source world, focusing on the need for a perfect open source product, an engaged community, and a sustainable business model. He sheds light on the collaborative and contribution-based model at Kaleidos. Also, there’s a conversation about the future of Penpot and its community, and Pablo shares insights about the upcoming Penpot Fest in Barcelona, and he mentions some upcoming features for Penpot.

<p>[00:01:36] Pablo tells us how it is to lead a company like Kaleidos. </p>

<p>[00:03:47] He highlights the importance of autonomy and co-ownership within teams. </p>

<p>[00:06:07] Pablo describes the collaborative and contribution-based model at Kaleidos. He touches on the evolution of the company’s culture, strong opinions, relevant consensus, and the continuous process of redefining themselves. </p>

<p>[00:09:18] In regard to challenges he faced building Penpot, Pablo emphasizes not taking shortcuts and staying true to their values, using accessibility as an example.  He also tells us they explore the cultural aspects of Kaleidos, the privilege they enjoy in taking risks, and the commitment to their principles and values. </p>

<p>[00:12:21] There’s a conversation on the work that goes into achieving accessibility in Pablo’s design tool, Taiga.</p>

<p>[00:15:00] Memo wonders what’s next for Penpot and Taiga, and Pablo mentions the upcoming Penpot Fest in Barcelona, where open source communities will join forces to discuss the future design and development using open source and open standards. He also talks about the upcoming features for Penpot, as well as the integration of Taiga into Penpot. </p>

<p>[00:20:23] Pablo highlights the significance of versioning and sharing knowledge with the open source mindset. </p>

<p>[00:22:35] Pablo acknowledges the challenges of balancing abundant content and true accessibility and emphasizes the need for powerful design that empowers designers, and he shares what it takes to be a designer.  </p>

<p>[00:28:11] He expresses the importance of cracking the relationship between designers and developers to grow the Penpot community organically, with the ultimate goal of having a strong user base and active contributors.  </p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:04:17] “When people work together and are generous with their talent and time, great things happen, open source is just one of those implementations.”</p>

<p>[00:09:52] “The toughest thing to do is not taking shortcuts.”</p>

<p>[00:13:19] “This is not an afterthought, this is not a patch, this is part of a better product.”</p>

<p>[00:14:47] “Look for where there are no incentives, and you’ll probably find a better product to build.”</p>

<p>[00:24:07] “Design is where technology meets society.”</p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, Richard is super excited to have as his guest, Mike Gifford, who’s a Senior Strategist at CivicActions and a thought leader on digital accessibility and the public sector. He was the Founder and President of OpenConcept Consulting, which worked extensively with Drupal, and he became a Drupal 8 Core Accessibility Maintainer in 2012. As a long-term environmentalist, Mike has found ways to integrate his passions for the web and planet. Today, Mike talks about his views on sustainability, his work with open source software, and the importance of accessibility and multilingualism in technology. Download this episode now to hear more! 
[00:02:18] Mike shares his views on sustainability, and he tells us he’s been working fully with CivicActions for the last two years after closing OpenConcept Consulting. 
[00:04:18] We learn about CivicActions, a web development firm that does a lot of work with both open source and Drupal, as well as HCD. They primarily work in the government space, largely focused on the US government. 
[00:05:15] Mike tells us about the Canadian Open Source Advisory Board that he runs. 
[00:06:21] We find out the differences between the Canadian and US government’s approach to open source software.
[00:08:13] How does Mike see himself as a designer in all these conversations? He talks about the work he does with the Drupal community to make Drupal more accessible. 
[00:09:35] Mike explains where oral design interfaces mix with open source and he mentions Preston So from the Drupal community, who wrote the book, Voice Content and Usability.
[00:11:11] We hear about the groups of people who are looking at accessibility. 
[00:13:38] There’s some great tools that are useful when talking about the disability spectrum, such as Accessibility Insights, which is a Microsoft tool, and an accessibility engine called, axe, which was built by Deque.
[00:15:41] Mike talks about the multilingual accessibility being a challenge in technology, and the challenges of identifying language content and tools, especially in open source software, and the predominance of English in accessibility resources. 
[00:18:02] We hear about the open source work Mike’s doing with CivicActions, a project he was involved in creating called, OpenACR, and the need for procurement to include accessibility requirements.
[00:20:52] He highlights the responsibility of open source maintainers to set an example of accessibility best practices. 
[00:22:39] How does Mike think ChatGPT is going influence accessibility practices? He emphasizes the responsibility of humans to evaluate and implement accessible code. 
[00:26:00] Richard and Mike discuss the importance of building accessibility into the workflow of teams and developers. Accessibility is not just for those with disabilities but for everyone since abilities can impact all of us at one point.
[00:30:58] Mike tells us where you can find him on the web.      
Quotes
[00:02:33] “Sustainability is a word that is too loose and can be applied to many things much like accessibility.”
[00:13:51] “It’s about trying to remember that this is about progress, not perfection.”
[00:21:07] “I think there’s a huge responsibility for open source maintainers to set an example.”
[00:21:35] “If you provide examples in your code that aren’t following accessibility best practices, then you’re propagating that.”
[00:29:16] “Accessibility doesn’t just affect a small number of people; it affects all of us at one point or another because we’re human.”
Spotlight
[00:31:43] Richard’s spotlight is his neighbor, Susan Reid, and The Kitchen Table Poems that she writes. 
[00:32:23] Mike’s spotlight is CO2.js, a project from The Green Web Foundation.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Richard is the sole panelist today and he welcomes guest, Ashlyn Knox, who’s a web developer, UI/UX designer, and community contributor, joining us from the Fedora community. Today, Ashlyn talks about their work doing front-end development and design for their websites and apps team. They discuss the Fedora website revamp project, people involved, and the funding. They describe their experience with code switching and a design problem they faced while working on the navbar and how they solved it. Then, Ashlyn fills us in on the usability studies for the Fedora Project Website Revamp, using Penpot prototypes tested with real users, and how they believe a closer connection between design and dev teams is so important to improve design in open source projects. Download this episode now to hear more! 
[00:01:15] Ashlyn tells us what they do at Fedora, primarily doing front-end development and design work. 
[00:03:02] The revamp of the Fedora website has been a large project, and Ashlyn fills us in on the people involved, the process, and how the funding for Fedora comes from Red Hat and sponsors. 
[00:05:14] We hear about the stakeholders that they negotiate with as far as the decision making with the website.
[00:07:18] Ashlyn discusses their experience with code switching between design and development and how they need space to switch between the two.
[00:09:28] Ashlyn describes a particular design problem they faced while working on the navbar and how she needed a structured approach to solve it. 
[00:11:08] We hear Ashlyn’s history and how they were interested in coding as a kid but pursued a career in music teaching until the pandemic, which led them to taking a Bootcamp course. 
[00:12:47] They tell us about some of their previous projects and how it’s gone to design and build websites, as well as finding clients. 
[00:14:49] Ashlyn explains more about the usability studies for the Fedora Revamp Project and how that went. They mention an amazing book on usability studies they read called, Don’t Make Me Think. 
[00:17:33] Richard wonders how many people they had in their earliest usability study, where did they find them, and why is usability in the design process for open source projects seem so rare.
[00:19:09] The prototypes were built using Penpot, a Figma tool, and tested with real users. Ashlyn talks about having a close relationship between the development and design teams and how they acted as a bridge between the two during the project.
[00:21:01] Ashlyn shares that acknowledging the differences in languages and being okay with learning from each other can help make teams stronger and reduce miscommunication and friction. They also tell us how mentorship plays a crucial role and how they taught designers how to work with developers.
[00:24:42] Find out where you can follow Ashlyn on the web.
Quotes
[00:07:35] On Design: “Basically, I put that part of my brain into a box, and I just run with the other part of it.”
[00:21:09] “I think the acknowledgement of speaking different languages needs to be made and people just need to be okay with that and with learning other’s languages.”
Spotlight
[00:25:16] Richard’s spotlight is his high school art teacher, Mrs. Rosoff. 
[00:25:46] Ashlyn’s spotlight is Tony Grimes at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and Máirín Duffy with the Fedora Project.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Richard has two amazing guests joining him, Winfried Tilanus, who’s a Privacy Consultant at Privacy Company, and Emilie Tromp, who’s a Social Design Strategist at Reframing Studio. 
Today, they discuss how Privacy by Design should be approached, and the importance of understanding the different perspectives on privacy.  We’ll hear about the Samen Beter project they did, challenges of designing privacy centered systems, the importance of user feedback and testing, and the iterative process of building trust with users when it comes to their data. Download this episode to hear much more! 
[00:01:41] What is Privacy by Design?
[00:02:59] Emilie has more of a social design strategy background, so she tells us the project she worked on with Winfried through eHealth applications, and how Privacy by Design should be approached and the importance of understanding the different perspectives on privacy.
[00:07:27] Richard wonders if they’ve implemented Privacy by Design as a theoretical framework for designing something in any open source projects or if they’ve talked to open source projects and how they should implement this.
[00:08:53] Emilie explains more about the project they worked on called, Better Together (Samen Beter in Dutch).
[00:10:05] As part of this open standard that they’ve built for privacy by design, we find out how they made sure that they took into account all the different definitions of privacy. 
[00:12:17] Emilie and Winfried highlight how they tested some concepts with end users who don’t use eHealth but could envision a scenario in the future where they would be using eHealth, and they explain a game they developed called, The Privacy Game.
[00:17:15] Earlier, they mentioned this is an open standard they’re making, and we hear if someone wants to build an app, how they can implement Privacy by Design as a standard into their process.
[00:21:24] Richard wonders if he can see the standard for Privacy by Design and how he can apply it directly whenever he’s working, and Emily tells us there’s a new standard for Privacy by Design, currently in the draft stage.   
[00:26:52] In Emilie and Winfried’s work with implementing Privacy by Design, developing a standard on it, and talking to users, we learn what work they had to do to convince other people in their organization that it’s a good idea, and they share some ideas on how other designers do that.
[00:29:23] Winfried and Emilie gave a talk at FOSDEM, and we hear if they had any special notes about reaching out to open source designers or developers about how they could implement these principles into their work.
[00:31:05] Find out where you can learn more about Privacy by Design and where to follow Winfried and Emilie on the web. 
Quotes
[00:29:50] “It may be even easier for open source developers to work through the methodology because a lot of projects have clear stated principles as guidelines for what commits to accept or not.”
[00:30:18] “When it’s open source, it’s much easier to show what you’re doing in reality is what you show also, that it aligns.”
Spotlight
[00:33:08] Richard’s spotlight is Privacy Badger.
[00:33:28] Winfried’s spotlight is the book, The Space Between Us by Cynthia Cockburn.
[00:34:11] Emilie’s spotlight is the book, Le Grand Vide by Lea Murawiec.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Richard has two amazing guests joining him, Winfried Tilanus, who’s a Privacy Consultant at Privacy Company, and Emilie Tromp, who’s a Social Design Strategist at Reframing Studio. </p>

<p>Today, they discuss how Privacy by Design should be approached, and the importance of understanding the different perspectives on privacy.  We’ll hear about the Samen Beter project they did, challenges of designing privacy centered systems, the importance of user feedback and testing, and the iterative process of building trust with users when it comes to their data. Download this episode to hear much more! </p>

<p>[00:01:41] What is Privacy by Design?</p>

<p>[00:02:59] Emilie has more of a social design strategy background, so she tells us the project she worked on with Winfried through eHealth applications, and how Privacy by Design should be approached and the importance of understanding the different perspectives on privacy.</p>

<p>[00:07:27] Richard wonders if they’ve implemented Privacy by Design as a theoretical framework for designing something in any open source projects or if they’ve talked to open source projects and how they should implement this.</p>

<p>[00:08:53] Emilie explains more about the project they worked on called, Better Together (Samen Beter in Dutch).</p>

<p>[00:10:05] As part of this open standard that they’ve built for privacy by design, we find out how they made sure that they took into account all the different definitions of privacy. </p>

<p>[00:12:17] Emilie and Winfried highlight how they tested some concepts with end users who don’t use eHealth but could envision a scenario in the future where they would be using eHealth, and they explain a game they developed called, The Privacy Game.</p>

<p>[00:17:15] Earlier, they mentioned this is an open standard they’re making, and we hear if someone wants to build an app, how they can implement Privacy by Design as a standard into their process.</p>

<p>[00:21:24] Richard wonders if he can see the standard for Privacy by Design and how he can apply it directly whenever he’s working, and Emily tells us there’s a new standard for Privacy by Design, currently in the draft stage.   </p>

<p>[00:26:52] In Emilie and Winfried’s work with implementing Privacy by Design, developing a standard on it, and talking to users, we learn what work they had to do to convince other people in their organization that it’s a good idea, and they share some ideas on how other designers do that.</p>

<p>[00:29:23] Winfried and Emilie gave a talk at FOSDEM, and we hear if they had any special notes about reaching out to open source designers or developers about how they could implement these principles into their work.</p>

<p>[00:31:05] Find out where you can learn more about Privacy by Design and where to follow Winfried and Emilie on the web. </p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:29:50] “It may be even easier for open source developers to work through the methodology because a lot of projects have clear stated principles as guidelines for what commits to accept or not.”</p>

<p>[00:30:18] “When it’s open source, it’s much easier to show what you’re doing in reality is what you show also, that it aligns.”</p>

<h4>Spotlight</h4>

<ul>
<li>[00:33:08] Richard’s spotlight is Privacy Badger.</li>
<li>[00:33:28] Winfried’s spotlight is the book, <em>The Space Between Us</em> by Cynthia Cockburn.</li>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design, a podcast where we discuss the intersections between design, open source, and what it takes to sustain communities that interact with both. Today, Django is hosting, and he’s excited to talk to his guest, Mogashni Naidoo, who’s a UX Researcher working in open source Bitcoin products and applications.  The conversation covers her journey from volunteering in the Bitcoin community to becoming a UX research evangelist. Mo discusses her work on Lightning Wallet, and she shares her passion for the Bitcoin Industry’s ethos of financial freedom and openness.  She also emphasizes her work ethic of working in public, she shares her approach to working in the open, which involves sharing her work very openly in the Slack community and posting a blog once a week. We’ll also here the importance of building products that empower users and make them feel confident and educated in their actions. Download this episode to hear more!  
[00:01:08] Mo tells us what she does as a UX research evangelist within the Bitcoin design community, and what it looks like to be advocating user research in this field. 
[00:03:10] Django brings up a project called Lightning Wallet and asks Mo what this project looked like before she came on board and how hit looks now.
[00:06:32] We hear about the ethos and the sensibilities Mo took in when she started this work.
[00:09:26] If you’re listening right now and want to learn about Bitcoin, how to speak in this field, and how to listen in this field, Mo tells us how you can. 
[00:13:15] When talking about fostering new growth and sustaining open source, what’s the role of the public design mentor?
[00:19:13] Mo tells us about a Bitcoin UX Research toolkit she’s building, and how it’s taught her a lot about working out in the open and working in public.
[00:21:29] When talking about empowerment in the idea of physical independence, Django wonders how we can make people feel better when they’re using a lightning wallet or Bitcoin products. 
[00:26:46] Find out where you follow Mo on the web.
Spotlight
[00:23:40] Mo’s spotlight is the Bitcoin Design Community. 
[00:25:12] Django’s spotlight is sharing he’s a Film Photographer, and using the Massive Dev Chart which is the reason he’s been able to get this far in his art.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design, a podcast where we discuss the intersections between design, open source, and what it takes to sustain communities that interact with both. Today, Django is hosting, and he’s excited to talk to his guest, Mogashni Naidoo, who’s a UX Researcher working in open source Bitcoin products and applications.  The conversation covers her journey from volunteering in the Bitcoin community to becoming a UX research evangelist. Mo discusses her work on Lightning Wallet, and she shares her passion for the Bitcoin Industry’s ethos of financial freedom and openness.  She also emphasizes her work ethic of working in public, she shares her approach to working in the open, which involves sharing her work very openly in the Slack community and posting a blog once a week. We’ll also here the importance of building products that empower users and make them feel confident and educated in their actions. Download this episode to hear more!  </p>

<p>[00:01:08] Mo tells us what she does as a UX research evangelist within the Bitcoin design community, and what it looks like to be advocating user research in this field. </p>

<p>[00:03:10] Django brings up a project called Lightning Wallet and asks Mo what this project looked like before she came on board and how hit looks now.</p>

<p>[00:06:32] We hear about the ethos and the sensibilities Mo took in when she started this work.</p>

<p>[00:09:26] If you’re listening right now and want to learn about Bitcoin, how to speak in this field, and how to listen in this field, Mo tells us how you can. </p>

<p>[00:13:15] When talking about fostering new growth and sustaining open source, what’s the role of the public design mentor?</p>

<p>[00:19:13] Mo tells us about a Bitcoin UX Research toolkit she’s building, and how it’s taught her a lot about working out in the open and working in public.</p>

<p>[00:21:29] When talking about empowerment in the idea of physical independence, Django wonders how we can make people feel better when they’re using a lightning wallet or Bitcoin products. </p>

<p>[00:26:46] Find out where you follow Mo on the web.</p>

<h4>Spotlight</h4>

<ul>
<li>[00:23:40] Mo’s spotlight is the Bitcoin Design Community. </li>
<li>[00:25:12] Django’s spotlight is sharing he’s a Film Photographer, and using the Massive Dev Chart which is the reason he’s been able to get this far in his art.</li>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we have an amazing guest joining us, Daniel Burka, who’s a product manager and designer who focuses on solving complex global health problems in simple ways. Currently, he’s the director of product and design at Resolve to Save Lives, where he leads the open source project, Simple. Simple is used by thousands of hospitals in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Ethiopia to manage over 3.2 million patients with hypertension and diabetes. He’s also on the board of Laboratoria, and Founded the open source project Health icons, to provide free icons to healthcare projects around the world.  Daniel started his career with a design agency but switched his focus towards global health. We’ll hear all the cool things he’s doing with the Simple project, he details how design really matters in public health projects, and how he thinks of design. We end with an extraordinary sentiment from Daniel saying, “Design is a big tent, and we need to welcome more people into that tent.” Find out why he said this and much more. Press download now! 
[00:01:30] Daniel tells us what he’s currently doing right now with the Simple project.
[00:02:48] Since Daniel is shifting his focus towards healthcare, we hear how that happened. 
[00:06:21] How did Daniel go about integrating the field with the design aspect when he was approaching a problem like Simple?
[00:12:12] We hear about the intersection and how the intersection functions between paper and digital.
[00:13:55] How can you be a designer without relying so much of your work on technology?
[00:17:22] Django shines some light on the idea of the service of a designer, and he asks Daniel to tell us what the majority of his design process involves in his work.
[00:20:06] Memo shares his thoughts on how only a few designers can work on problems that Daniel is working on, and he wonders how we can make working in healthcare more universal and access of the design work more universal. 
[00:29:50] Find out where you can follow Daniel on the web.
Quotes
[00:04:46] “The challenge with venture capital, it’s very cushy, but none of the problems are your problems.” 
[00:07:06] “The first thing you notice is that healthcare workers have almost no time.”
[00:10:06] “I was in Switzerland to speak at a conference, and the title of the talk was, “Can Designers Save Lives? Not By Themselves.”
[00:12:19] “Technologists love to think that we should digitize everything. Paper is great!”
[00:15:16] “Another thing that’s really important is to think about who sets the requirements for a system.”
[00:18:08] “A lot of design is talking.”
[00:18:22] “Designers love coming in with solutions, but oftentimes, especially in healthcare, you’re designing for an audience who’s very unlike you.”
[00:18:46] “I like that designers can be shepherds of those kinds of stories and connect the decision makers to healthcare workers who literally work for those decision makers.”
[00:19:09] “One of the superpowers of design is to make potential futures appear real.” 
Spotlight
[00:26:49] Django’s spotlight is nappy.co.
[00:27:54] Daniel’s spotlight is the book, Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling.
[00:29:14] Memo’s spotlight is The New Ways of Working Playbook by Mark Eddleston.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Richard is very excited to have a guest with him since he’s solo today. Joining him is Seth Hillbrand, who’s a Lead Developer at KiCad, which is one of the leading electronic design and automation tools, and he’s the Founder of KiCad Services Corporation. Today, Seth explains what KiCad does, the products they make, how the KiCad project works, and how donations, services, and feature implementations help to fund it. We’ll also learn how KiCad has created ways to donate, interact, and be a part of their community. Download this episode now!
[00:01:10] Seth tells us what he does at KiCad, what KiCad does, and what kind of physical products the designers are making, which are some amazing things.
[00:05:59] How many people and how many developers are using KiCad?
[00:07:42] We heard about the contributors, and now we’ll learn about how the funding works for the open source project itself, and it may surprise you to hear that the bulk of their funding comes through donations, but not in the usual way that people do donations.
[00:13:45] Richard brings up the donate banner at the top of the KiCad page and wonders how Seth is designing this button for donations, and if it’s to make users feel different or to stick around. 
[00:20:11] Seth explains how KiCad is not immune to the idea of radical transparency when it comes to showing how their funds are being used, he tells us for the KiCad project how they have different ways of distributing funds, and he how they changed their release model. 
[00:33:59] Find out where you can follow Seth and KiCad online.
Quotes
[00:09:59] “Everyone says you can’t build an open source project on donations, and I want to emphasize that is bunk. That is not a true statement unless you do the donation design wrong.”
[00:18:25] “We have two groups within our larger community. One group is the designers and the engineers who use KiCad to build their boards and projects, and the other group is going to be all the other industries that surround us that benefit from KiCad’s existence and want to have a greater say in how the community develops, because it’s a part of their success for KiCad to be successful.”
[00:21:53] “The hardest thing we have to do in KiCad is pay people to do work.”

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On this episode, our guests are from The Alan Turing Institute in the UK. Today, joining us are Georgia Aitkenhead, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, and Susanna Fantoni, who are here to talk about an open source project they are working on called, AutSPACEs, which is a co-designed citizen science platform that investigates autism and sensory processing. You’ll learn their backgrounds, why they’re doing this project, and the vast importance in this kind of participatory research, involving people’s voices and views, and letting autistic people lead. While you listen, you can’t help but notice the passion they have for research and how this project is so important to them.  Download this episode now to learn more! 
[00:01:10] Our guests introduce themselves, tell us their backgrounds, and more about their project, AutSPACEs.
[00:03:38] To help us understand more about the project, Georgia Aitkenhead and Susanna share with us how long the project has been going on and the specific key moments have been for them.  
[00:09:56] In their project, Georgia Aitkenhead tells us their process of how they listen to everyone while not burning out with the amount of feedback they get from all the people, and Bastian explains how they are not at that larger scale area yet and only working with a small community of participants.
[00:14:26] A question comes up regarding design choices and governance, and Georgia Bullen wonders how our guests are making it with this project, and how they’re thinking about that plays into the platform itself that they are all working on.  
[00:31:20] In thinking about accessibility, Django wonders if they’ve ever considered publishing information on a landing page or to make it accessible to people who might be the most literate for GitHub and technical repositories.
Quotes
[00:04:22] “There’s often a disparity between research that gets funded and research that autistic people as a group tend to prefer.”
[00:08:17] “A computer algorithm can work out that I’m autistic in less than two minutes, but it took fifteen years for humans to do it.”
[00:08:51] “The whole assessment process is written just for men by men.”
[00:10:21] “Be very deliberate about how you address some of the disbalances and representation that exist and think about the demographics, people, or situations people might be in. That means they might be likely excluded from research.” 
[00:27:13] “We have this really vital challenge to address in terms of making sure that the spaces that are open are open genuinely for everybody, not just for people who are already technically confident, neurotypical, or in privileged demographics.” 
Spotlight
[00:36:35] Georgia’s spotlight is Hometown: A Mastodon fork, and some articles that are on her reading list relating to online community spaces. 
[00:37:09] Bastian’s spotlight is Biopython.
[00:37:36] Georgia Aitkenhead’s spotlight is The Turing Way.
[00:38:22] Susanna’s spotlight is RPTools.
[00:39:00] Richard’s spotlight is Clinical Partners.

<p>[00:09:56] In their project, Georgia Aitkenhead tells us their process of how they listen to everyone while not burning out with the amount of feedback they get from all the people, and Bastian explains how they are not at that larger scale area yet and only working with a small community of participants.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:04:22] “There’s often a disparity between research that gets funded and research that autistic people as a group tend to prefer.”</p>

<p>[00:08:17] “A computer algorithm can work out that I’m autistic in less than two minutes, but it took fifteen years for humans to do it.”</p>

<p>[00:08:51] “The whole assessment process is written just for men by men.”</p>

<p>[00:10:21] “Be very deliberate about how you address some of the disbalances and representation that exist and think about the demographics, people, or situations people might be in. That means they might be likely excluded from research.” </p>

<p>[00:27:13] “We have this really vital challenge to address in terms of making sure that the spaces that are open are open genuinely for everybody, not just for people who are already technically confident, neurotypical, or in privileged demographics.” </p>

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On this episode, our guests are from The Alan Turing Institute in the UK. Today, joining us are Georgia Aitkenhead, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, and Susanna Fantoni, who are here to talk about an open source project they are working on called, AutSPACEs, which is a co-designed citizen science platform that investigates autism and sensory processing. You’ll learn their backgrounds, why they’re doing this project, and the vast importance in this kind of participatory research, involving people’s voices and views, and letting autistic people lead. While you listen, you can’t help but notice the passion they have for research and how this project is so important to them.  Download this episode now to learn more! </p>

<p>[00:01:10] Our guests introduce themselves, tell us their backgrounds, and more about their project, AutSPACEs.</p>

She was introduced to FOSS the Fedora Project and Open Source Design through an Outreachy internship, and we’re going to talk more about how useful this internship is at getting people into open source. You’ll hear Marie’s passion for supporting underrepresented people into open source, especially in project management, graphic design, and mentorship, and explains how she utilized the Outreachy program, and shares advice on where to begin if you’re interested in becoming a mentor. We’ll also learn about the Fedora community and how that works for interns and new designers, and she speaks more about the need for project and program management at Fedora. Go ahead and download this episode now! 
[00:02:20] We hear Marie’s journey of how she got into open source and how she got involved in Outreachy. 
[00:09:06] Marie tells us how she pays it forward by being a mentor to people who may be in a similar spot. 
[00:12:39] Marie discusses the interactions she had working at Fedora, the Code of Conduct she implemented at Fedora, what her focus is right now, and what she’s excited about. 
[00:16:35] Django brings up rough jobs being very important and taking an intense roll, and Marie talks about putting mental health at the forefront in community care taking and how she’s focusing on this in the future. 
[00:20:02] We learn how delegation and prioritizing are key things to have to take care of yourself and the community well-being. 
[00:21:02] We hear more about the mentorship process and how Marie utilized the Outreachy program, and she tells us about the Fedora design team mentorship.
[00:23:25] If you’re interested in mentoring people but not sure where to begin, Marie shares some advice on how you can do that. 
[00:24:47] Marie explains how the Fedora community works for interns and young designers to get involved, the teams, active designers, and internships they have. Also, we hear about the need for people at Fedora doing project and program management. 
[00:32:39] Find out where you can follow Marie online.
Quotes
[00:16:47] “I just jumped into this community management world not really having a ton of experience with community management. Luckily, I’m empathic and intuitive by nature but that also brings on a lot of emotional weight especially when you’re in a position like this.”
[00:17:23] “You can’t take care of other people without taking care of yourself.”
[00:17:37] “You have to be able to set boundaries, like not getting notifications on your phone.”
[00:18:02] “There’s work-life balance, but if you do something you love, it’s hard to stop. But if you don’t stop, you’re forced to stop.”
[00:23:51] “I’m trying to pass on the mentorship skills to other people. It doesn’t come naturally.”

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.</p>

<p>On this episode, we are excited to have joining us Marie Nordin, who’s the Code of Conduct Specialist working out of Red Hat’s Open Source Program Office.  She was introduced to FOSS the Fedora Project and Open Source Design through an Outreachy internship, and we’re going to talk more about how useful this internship is at getting people into open source. You’ll hear Marie’s passion for supporting underrepresented people into open source, especially in project management, graphic design, and mentorship, and explains how she utilized the Outreachy program, and shares advice on where to begin if you’re interested in becoming a mentor. We’ll also learn about the Fedora community and how that works for interns and new designers, and she speaks more about the need for project and program management at Fedora. Go ahead and download this episode now! </p>

<p>[00:02:20] We hear Marie’s journey of how she got into open source and how she got involved in Outreachy. </p>

<p>[00:09:06] Marie tells us how she pays it forward by being a mentor to people who may be in a similar spot. </p>

<p>[00:12:39] Marie discusses the interactions she had working at Fedora, the Code of Conduct she implemented at Fedora, what her focus is right now, and what she’s excited about. </p>

<p>[00:16:35] Django brings up rough jobs being very important and taking an intense roll, and Marie talks about putting mental health at the forefront in community care taking and how she’s focusing on this in the future. </p>

<p>[00:20:02] We learn how delegation and prioritizing are key things to have to take care of yourself and the community well-being. </p>

<p>[00:21:02] We hear more about the mentorship process and how Marie utilized the Outreachy program, and she tells us about the Fedora design team mentorship.</p>

<p>[00:23:25] If you’re interested in mentoring people but not sure where to begin, Marie shares some advice on how you can do that. </p>

<p>[00:24:47] Marie explains how the Fedora community works for interns and young designers to get involved, the teams, active designers, and internships they have. Also, we hear about the need for people at Fedora doing project and program management. </p>

<p>[00:32:39] Find out where you can follow Marie online.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:16:47] “I just jumped into this community management world not really having a ton of experience with community management. Luckily, I’m empathic and intuitive by nature but that also brings on a lot of emotional weight especially when you’re in a position like this.”</p>

<p>[00:17:23] “You can’t take care of other people without taking care of yourself.”</p>

<p>[00:17:37] “You have to be able to set boundaries, like not getting notifications on your phone.”</p>

<p>[00:18:02] “There’s work-life balance, but if you do something you love, it’s hard to stop. But if you don’t stop, you’re forced to stop.”</p>

<p>[00:23:51] “I’m trying to pass on the mentorship skills to other people. It doesn’t come naturally.”</p>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On this episode, Richard, Victory, and Django have a great guest joining them. Today, we have Jason van Gumster, who’s the Blender Consulting Lead at Orange Turbine. He’s also run a small animation studio, written Blender For Dummies, co-authored GIMP Bible, and nearly everything he produces are all made using free and open source tools from applications all the way down to his choice of operating system.  Jason dives into the Blender community, what it is, and why it holds a special place in his heart.   We’ll also learn specific ways open source is necessary to his work, and he shares advice for new designers who have little experience and are trying to get into open source programs, as well as what he’s most excited about in the design community that’s happening right now. Download this episode now to find out more cool stuff! 
[00:02:42] Jason tells us the story of why he produces anti-counterfeiting technology.
[00:03:51] We learn Jason's experience with currency design
[00:04:30] Jason fills our minds with the Blender community and why it holds such a special place in his heart, and he explains how fits into the continuum with the Blender community where there’s designers who are also coders.
[00:08:04] Richard wonders how Jason squares away automating things in the design process while also enabling the creative juices to flow. 
[00:10:45] We hear how Jason decides where the monotony ends, where the art begins, and how he’s forgotten how to be bored.
[00:12:19] Jason dives into why open source is so necessary to his work and why it’s necessary that lender be open source.
[00:14:48] Going back to the open source tools Jason uses for creative development, Victory wonders if there are others he’s tried besides Blender.
[00:16:39] We hear some great advice on how to begin the process if you are a designer who hasn’t been using open source programs, you don’t have much experience, and you’re trying to break out of the closed source ecosystem. 
[00:18:42] Django wonders what Jason’s response is to the person who hears the word open source and what they really hear is the phrase, “No money.”  What would he say to a creative who’s very closed to the idea of open?
[00:19:56] Jason tells us how he helps out the communities for the tools he’s using to go and get his money as an independent designer/worker. He also tells us more about the ASWF that focuses on open source tools that are useful in animation and visual effects. 
[00:23:12] We learn about conversations Jason’s had with toolmakers because they’re interested in operability, a workshop he did with Blender, and his thoughts on people in game studios.  
[00:27:02] We find out if open source communities naturally retain their talent more than churn just design house.
[00:28:54] What is Jason most excited about in the design community that’s happening right now?
[00:30:06] Find out where you can follow Jason on the web.
Quotes
[00:03:13] “Currency Designers are actually UI Designers.  It’s the oldest user Interface in existence.”
[00:10:50] “On some level, I have forgotten how to be bored.  But I recognize monotonous repetition. I describe a lot of things in terms of taste and if it tastes weird to do or tastes annoying to do, or I don’t like the flavor of that behavior, then that’s something that I want to automate away.”
[00:18:57] “You show up, [use OSS], be awesome, and then when someone asks you what you did it with, that’s when you drop the bomb.”
[00:22:02] “Money helps, but really, it’s manpower.  A 3D studio has technical people who are capable of doing code and development and there’s no reason why they can’t make changes and push them upstream.” 
[00:28:08] “People come for the help, people come for the price, but they stay because they got helped, and they stayed because they were included, and their thoughts were appreciated.”
[00:29:12] “Everything is design, and it permeates though just about everything we do, but that also gives us a bit of hubris.”
Spotlight
[00:31:02] Django’s spotlight is MyPaint.
[00:31:32] Victory’s spotlight is all the open source design tools.
[00:31:55] Richard’s spotlight is Colin’s Bear Animation.
[00:32:42] Jason’s spotlight is the entire Blender community.

<p>[00:14:48] Going back to the open source tools Jason uses for creative development, Victory wonders if there are others he’s tried besides Blender.</p>

<p>[00:16:39] We hear some great advice on how to begin the process if you are a designer who hasn’t been using open source programs, you don’t have much experience, and you’re trying to break out of the closed source ecosystem. </p>

<p>[00:18:42] Django wonders what Jason’s response is to the person who hears the word open source and what they really hear is the phrase, “No money.”  What would he say to a creative who’s very closed to the idea of open?</p>

<p>[00:19:56] Jason tells us how he helps out the communities for the tools he’s using to go and get his money as an independent designer/worker. He also tells us more about the ASWF that focuses on open source tools that are useful in animation and visual effects. </p>

<p>[00:23:12] We learn about conversations Jason’s had with toolmakers because they’re interested in operability, a workshop he did with Blender, and his thoughts on people in game studios.  </p>

<p>[00:27:02] We find out if open source communities naturally retain their talent more than churn just design house.</p>

<p>[00:28:54] What is Jason most excited about in the design community that’s happening right now?</p>

<p>[00:30:06] Find out where you can follow Jason on the web.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:03:13] “Currency Designers are actually UI Designers.  It’s the oldest user Interface in existence.”</p>

<p>[00:10:50] “On some level, I have forgotten how to be bored.  But I recognize monotonous repetition. I describe a lot of things in terms of taste and if it tastes weird to do or tastes annoying to do, or I don’t like the flavor of that behavior, then that’s something that I want to automate away.”</p>

<p>[00:18:57] “You show up, [use OSS], be awesome, and then when someone asks you what you did it with, that’s when you drop the bomb.”</p>

<p>[00:22:02] “Money helps, but really, it’s manpower.  A 3D studio has technical people who are capable of doing code and development and there’s no reason why they can’t make changes and push them upstream.” </p>

<p>[00:28:08] “People come for the help, people come for the price, but they stay because they got helped, and they stayed because they were included, and their thoughts were appreciated.”</p>

<p>[00:29:12] “Everything is design, and it permeates though just about everything we do, but that also gives us a bit of hubris.”</p>

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On this episode, Richard, Victory, and Django have a great guest joining them. Today, we have Jason van Gumster, who’s the Blender Consulting Lead at Orange Turbine. He’s also run a small animation studio, written <em>Blender For Dummies</em>, co-authored <em>GIMP Bible</em>, and nearly everything he produces are all made using free and open source tools from applications all the way down to his choice of operating system.  Jason dives into the Blender community, what it is, and why it holds a special place in his heart.   We’ll also learn specific ways open source is necessary to his work, and he shares advice for new designers who have little experience and are trying to get into open source programs, as well as what he’s most excited about in the design community that’s happening right now. Download this episode now to find out more cool stuff! </p>

<p>[00:02:42] Jason tells us the story of why he produces anti-counterfeiting technology.</p>

<p>[00:03:51] We learn Jason&#39;s experience with currency design</p>

<p>[00:04:30] Jason fills our minds with the Blender community and why it holds such a special place in his heart, and he explains how fits into the continuum with the Blender community where there’s designers who are also coders.</p>

<p>[00:08:04] Richard wonders how Jason squares away automating things in the design process while also enabling the creative juices to flow. </p>

<p>[00:10:45] We hear how Jason decides where the monotony ends, where the art begins, and how he’s forgotten how to be bored.</p>

<p>[00:12:19] Jason dives into why open source is so necessary to his work and why it’s necessary that lender be open source.</p>

<p>[00:14:48] Going back to the open source tools Jason uses for creative development, Victory wonders if there are others he’s tried besides Blender.</p>

<p>[00:16:39] We hear some great advice on how to begin the process if you are a designer who hasn’t been using open source programs, you don’t have much experience, and you’re trying to break out of the closed source ecosystem. </p>

<p>[00:18:42] Django wonders what Jason’s response is to the person who hears the word open source and what they really hear is the phrase, “No money.”  What would he say to a creative who’s very closed to the idea of open?</p>

<p>[00:19:56] Jason tells us how he helps out the communities for the tools he’s using to go and get his money as an independent designer/worker. He also tells us more about the ASWF that focuses on open source tools that are useful in animation and visual effects. </p>

<p>[00:23:12] We learn about conversations Jason’s had with toolmakers because they’re interested in operability, a workshop he did with Blender, and his thoughts on people in game studios.  </p>

<p>[00:27:02] We find out if open source communities naturally retain their talent more than churn just design house.</p>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.  On today’s episode, we wanted to have a reintroduction to us as a group and find out what’s going on with us and what we’re all doing these days since we don’t get to talk very much. Also, this is the last podcast of the 2022 season, and it’s truly been an exciting one for us. So, on this last episode, we’re going to talk a little bit about some past things we discussed before, current events of the day, stuff we’re working on, and then we’ll discuss some cool things we would like to happen on this podcast for the 2023 season which is only a few months away. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! 
[00:03:34] Each panelist shares things they’ve been thinking about lately to do with Open Source Design, things they’ve been working on a personal level around open source and their design efforts. Eriol starts by telling us what they’ve been doing to help out the Open Source Design Community with internships, fellowships, and supporting the mentoring process.
[00:09:22] Eriol talks about the challenges they’ve had, ways people could help out, and where people can follow along.
[00:12:20] Richard tells us his story, what he’s doing with Open Source Collective, and how he’s figuring out how to help open source projects to spend the money they got. 
[00:16:31] Georgia brings up topics for the future and talks about community development that is a design process, and how she thinks about what we could do more of is to take a challenge like Eriol talked about with designing an internship program and to make it a collaborative thinking space by talking with other people.
[00:17:39] We find out what Memo is up to with his work, growing the design team at Open Collective, things he’s focusing on, and ideas with what he would like to see happen on the podcast next season. 
[00:20:50] Memo tells us some other cool stuff he’s working on. 
[00:23:58] Georgia brings up having future conversations to have about what it takes to serve the design industry with tools.
[00:26:11] Memo shares his thoughts about expanding our circles further, and Georgia fills us in on everything that’s going on in her world at Simply Secure.
[00:36:05] Find out where you can reach out to the discourse, podcast, and panelists to find out more and if you are interested in talking to us about ideas for this podcast.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.  On today’s episode, we wanted to have a reintroduction to us as a group and find out what’s going on with us and what we’re all doing these days since we don’t get to talk very much. Also, this is the last podcast of the 2022 season, and it’s truly been an exciting one for us. So, on this last episode, we’re going to talk a little bit about some past things we discussed before, current events of the day, stuff we’re working on, and then we’ll discuss some cool things we would like to happen on this podcast for the 2023 season which is only a few months away. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! </p>

<p>[00:03:34] Each panelist shares things they’ve been thinking about lately to do with Open Source Design, things they’ve been working on a personal level around open source and their design efforts. Eriol starts by telling us what they’ve been doing to help out the Open Source Design Community with internships, fellowships, and supporting the mentoring process.</p>

<p>[00:09:22] Eriol talks about the challenges they’ve had, ways people could help out, and where people can follow along.</p>

<p>[00:12:20] Richard tells us his story, what he’s doing with Open Source Collective, and how he’s figuring out how to help open source projects to spend the money they got. </p>

<p>[00:16:31] Georgia brings up topics for the future and talks about community development that is a design process, and how she thinks about what we could do more of is to take a challenge like Eriol talked about with designing an internship program and to make it a collaborative thinking space by talking with other people.</p>

<p>[00:17:39] We find out what Memo is up to with his work, growing the design team at Open Collective, things he’s focusing on, and ideas with what he would like to see happen on the podcast next season. </p>

<p>[00:20:50] Memo tells us some other cool stuff he’s working on. </p>

<p>[00:23:58] Georgia brings up having future conversations to have about what it takes to serve the design industry with tools.</p>

<p>[00:26:11] Memo shares his thoughts about expanding our circles further, and Georgia fills us in on everything that’s going on in her world at Simply Secure.</p>

<p>[00:36:05] Find out where you can reach out to the discourse, podcast, and panelists to find out more and if you are interested in talking to us about ideas for this podcast. </p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.
Our guest today is Chukwuka Ezeoke, who’s the Co-Founder and Head of Design at Spirē and was recently at the Open Source Community Africa (OSCA) 2022 event, where he was at the Sustain session, and facilitated the session on Design and wrote up the report on it. We’ll hear more about that event, along with another conference he put together called Untitled Design, which had over one thousand designers attending. He tells us more about Spirē, how he thinks the process could be improved with designers maintaining and contributing to open source, and he shares advice on how people from developing countries such as Nigeria, can get involved in projects that may be based in other parts of the world. Go ahead and download this episode now!
[00:01:41] Chukwuka tells us about Spirē, and we hear about the OSCA event that happened recently, how many people were there and what Chukwuka focused on in the design session.
[00:03:42] How did Chukwuka get into open source?
[00:07:32] Chukwuka explains the community of designers called, Untitled Designers, and why he thinks so many people attended their first design conference in Nigeria.
[00:10:18] We hear why Chukwuka thinks the turnout at the Sustain design session was so much lower than the other conference.
[00:11:05] Django asks Chukwuka to talk about road blocks that he might have suffered and ways it could be improved for him in his field to discovering new projects.
[00:12:41] When Chukwuka is looking at a project that he may be considering contributing to, he details what he looks for in documentation to improve his experience onboarding.
[00:16:38] We find out about the thousand designers that came to Chukwuka’s conference, how he found them, how they found him, and what the main themes were.
[00:19:46] If another conference was coming up what would Chukwuka say to designers who don’t know about open source and what would he say to get them involved? 
[00:20:57] We hear some thoughts on whether design and open source demands that you be an extrovert to do it well.
[00:22:53] Chukwuka goes in depth about Spirē and how they plan to make it open source, and how they onboard designers.
[00:24:33] Richard mentions the OSCA Sustain Africa 2022 Community Report and Chukwuka shares thoughts on how he thinks the process could be improved with designers maintaining and contributing to open source projects. Richard brings up a point about talking about a possible new strategy to talk about the goals of the project instead of mentioning design.
[00:29:38] Chukwuka talks about how people from developing countries like Nigeria can get involved in projects which are based elsewhere.
[00:35:12] Find out where you can follow Chukwuka on the internet.
Quotes
[00:08:13] “We are a community of designers in Africa building a sustainable design ecosystem by equipping designers with the tools, information, and access they need.”
[00:19:22] “Open source design is not talked about every year.”
[00:21:21] “You don’t need to be an extrovert to be in a part of any community or to contribute to open source.”
[00:25:57] “Maybe some form of remuneration for contribution would help to encourage them to keep contributing to a project or to open source.”
[00:26:10] “I think one of the reasons why people don’t want to get into open source is because they think that it’s pro bono work.”
[00:26:38] “Sometimes people have two jobs, so making contributions flexible for designers would also help.”
Spotlight
[00:36:06] Django’s spotlight is Ursula K. Le Guin and the book, A Wizard of Earthsea.
[00:36:41] Richard’s spotlight is Lin-Manuel Miranda and the movie, Encanto.
[00:37:09] Chukwuku’s spotlight is a community called, Usable.

<p>[00:26:38] “Sometimes people have two jobs, so making contributions flexible for designers would also help.”</p>

<h4>Spotlight</h4>

<ul>
<li>[00:36:06] Django’s spotlight is Ursula K. Le Guin and the book, <em>A Wizard of Earthsea.</em></li>
<li>[00:36:41] Richard’s spotlight is Lin-Manuel Miranda and the movie, <em>Encanto.</em></li>
<li>[00:37:09] Chukwuku’s spotlight is a community called, Usable.</li>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Our guest today is Björn Balazs joining us from Germany where he works for KDAB and has been a long-term designer in the open space.  He also co-founded Open Usability, one of the first initiatives to support Free Software with UX knowledge and practice, which we’ll be talking about today. We learn that Björn is a psychologist and a privacy activist, and what got him involved in design and open source. Find out his perspective on where the limit of what design is, a project he’s working on called polypoly, and a mind-blowing book he recommends that summarizes problems that happened with privacy issues we have and the way we use technology. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! 
[00:02:08] Björn explains how he got involved in design and open source.
[00:08:01] How does Björn see this perception of designers about themselves outside of the craft and does he think it’s hard for designers to consider themselves designers without having to touch any of the aesthetics?
[00:12:08] We hear where Björn’s perspective is on where the limit of what design is.
[00:14:09] Björn shares advice for projects that want to have better usability studies on their work before they think about redesigning it and how someone would go about implementing those.
[00:16:59] Memo wonders how Björn combines wanting information from the user and respecting their privacy, and he talks about a book called, _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism _and an initiative he joined called, polypoly.
[00:21:31] Richard wonders if Björn has other approaches that people can use to think about how to actively create a culture of practice around anti-surveillance capitalist work.
[00:22:59] Does Björn have any tricks that he uses to have conversations about users and privacy with his colleagues?
[00:28:04] Björn tells us about an active open source design group job board that anyone can go to look at jobs.
[00:30:16] Victory asks Björn if she was new to open source and wanted to contribute, how would she approach that community or project maintainer saying I’ve been watching your project and I think I could help. 
[00:32:54] Find out where you can follow Björn online.
Quotes
[00:13:16] “Design is a process where we all participate, professionals or not.”
[00:14:28] “Doing a usability study on your own as a designer is very dangerous and it’s very hard for involved people to get feedback unless their trained to do this.”
[00:15:20] “What you actually need is a usability strategy, not just a usability study.”
[00:17:29] “I really recommend the book by Shoshana Zuboff called, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism.”
Spotlight
[00:33:24] Memo’s spotlight is the tool, UI Colors.
[00:33:50] Victory’s spotlight is the open source community, Aviyel.
[00:34:18] Richard’s spotlight is the movie, Hold Fast by Moxie Marlinspike.
[00:35:08] Björn’s spotlight is KDE.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We have with us today, Isabela Presedo-Floyd, who’s a UX/UI Designer at Quansight Labs. She helps build open source scientific software with an emphasis on improving accessibility of communities and their tools, which we will be discussing in depth with her today. We learn about some of the projects Isabela’s been working on such as Jupyter, Spyder, Napari, and Conda.  Also, we find out how accessibility is the guiding compass for most of Isabela’s design things. Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more!  
[00:01:05] Isabela explains what she currently does, the different projects she works on, and the projects that she’s had to do the most creative problem solving for.
[00:03:46] We hear more about the imaging in bio fields and what that means to Isabela as a designer.
[00:06:51] The topic of transfer of knowledge is brought up and Isabela tells us how that’s made possible for her to contribute to these projects.
[00:10:47] Eriol wonders if Isabela has found other ways to find that sense of collaboration, that sense of social within the design process when she doesn’t have that many designers working in the open source and science space.
[00:14:50] Georgia wonders if Isabela uses any tools with people about how she validates design directions.
[00:18:52] How would Isabela sustain this work if she had a magic wand? We also hear about a manifesto document called Slow-Science.
[00:24:49] Isabela details how she’s worked with different kinds of accessibility needs in some of the complex tools, how designers within open source can pace themselves better to include them, and about the W3C and the alt text Decision Tree. 
[00:33:00] Find out where you can follow Isabela online.
Quotes
[00:09:26] “A lot of this is teaching people how to interact, teaching people the expectations they can transfer the knowledge, helping them transfer knowledge from other software.”
[00:09:54] “I don’t really hear people discussing that maintainers to me are also users. They’re just users with a very different goal.”
[00:13:13] “I feel that’s one of my main ways to collaborate because people are coming in showing me what work they’re doing and that gives me a better sense of what users are doing.”
[00:21:14] “If that pace pressure wasn’t on, maybe we would all be able to take that time to do the thoughtful things.”
[00:26:00] “I personally believe that accessibility is just good UX and is the guiding compass for most of my design things because it helps me make a lot of my choices.”
[00:28:40] “I’ve been working with trying to come up with contributing events that give that people that structure so that I can leverage whatever their skills are, and they can leverage mine.”
Spotlight
[00:33:39] Eriol’s spotlights are OPEN AAC and Project Lima. 
[00:34:35] Isabela’s spotlight is The A11Y Project.
[00:35:28] Georgia’s spotlight is a step forward in accessibility efforts with Figma.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today joining us as our guest is Clara García Viñola, who’s a Designer with Kaleidos. We’ll find out more about Clara’s job and what she does, she explains the design team and how they collaborate at Kaleidos, and she fills us in on building Taiga and Penpot. Also, Clara tells us about a design tool they are working on for everyone to use, not just designers. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more!
[00:01:50] Clara explains how she got the title of Full-Stop Designer and what she does.
[00:04:29] With Clara’s creative uprising, we find out what aspects of her personal philosophy fits with what she does at Kaleidos.
[00:05:59] We hear about the design team at Kaleidos.
[00:07:28] How is the Kaleidos team organized with working in open source with Clara’s team?
[00:10:56] Richard asks Clara if there’s any downsides to having all her designs open source, how she mitigates those downsides, and how she makes it easier.
[00:12:35] We learn how it was decided that Penpot was the next idea to build after Taiga.
[00:14:18] Clara explains some other alternatives they are working with.
[00:16:33] Find out about the relationship Kaleidos has with their communities and the ways users can communicate with them. 
[00:18:27] Is there any way to be involved in open source if you’re not working at the best company?
[00:23:59] Clara tells us what Kaleidos does to incorporate people who are members of the community, use the system, and may want to make changes if they find a bug.  Also, she tells us how they enable community members to be owners of the product.
[00:25:48] We hear about a design tool that is being worked on that everyone can use.
[00:28:18] Find out where you can learn more about Kaleidos and follow Clara online.

[00:07:20] “We design Penpot in Penpot.”
[00:09:05] “We have a design system, and we work from it and it’s open!”
[00:11:08] “Don’t feel that you need to do all that your users tell you to do.”
[00:12:55] “We have in Kaleidos two weeks a year as ‘Innovation weeks.’ Penpot came from that.”
[00:17:04] “The next step is for the design community to participate more and be more involved.”
[00:18:36] “It’s so difficult because the system is built right now with proprietary tools.”
[00:21:17] “We think that a design tool is a design tool that must be able to be used in any country, language, or speed connection of internet.”
[00:26:55] “We don’t want to make a design tool for designers, we want to make a design tool for everyone.”

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.  Today, we are joined by Jessica Müller, who’s the Senior UX Designer at Grafana Labs, where she leads the design efforts to make Grafana’s Alerting feature as user-friendly as possible. Our discussions today involve learning more about Grafana, what it means to design in an open source way for real, how Jessica got her start in open source, and what led her into working at Grafana. We also find out how Jessica encourages collaboration between the community team and UX designers, and if you’re just getting started in open source and want to find out how you can start to contribute, Jessica shares some helpful tips. Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more! 
[00:01:27] Jessica explains what it means to design in an open source way for real.
[00:02:55] We hear how Jessica started thinking about open source, how it worked out for her in her creative career and led her into working at Grafana.
[00:06:28] When Jessica is seeking a specific contribution, we learn how she goes about that with reaching out and if there’s a specific user base or an existing client base.
[00:10:11] Eriol wonders if Jessica thinks that the users that pay for Grafana value design more because of how they pay, if she thinks they engage more with it because they pay, and if she’s noticed anything different between the open source folks and how they value design.
[00:14:41] Memo asks if Jessica has a structured a way to plan new engagements with Grafana Labs, and she explains their culture of experimentation. 
[00:17:13] As a designer, how does Jessica go about encouraging the collaboration between the community team and the UX designers? 
[00:22:16] Jessica talks about the ratio of UX to engineer at Grafana and their approach to balance things out.
[00:27:16] Jessica shares some things that have helped the engineers feel well supported when they tackle the UX problems.
[00:29:12] Memo wonders how the open source way is for Grafana and if Jessica thinks every organization should have an open source way or if there should be more standardized contribution guidelines for designers. 
[00:32:00] If you’re a designer and want to get started in open source but you’re not sure how you can start to contribute, Jessica shares some suggestions on what might help, and she tells us what collaboration looked like when she started at Grafana.
[00:42:18] Find out where you can follow Jessica online.
Quotes
[00:14:04] “How can we be part of the same spirit?”
[00:23:04] “All of the engineers are doing UX work whether I like that or not!”
[00:28:21] “Having a place to send people to show their stuff and talk to someone about it is already so helpful.”
Spotlight
[00:38:22] Jessica’s spotlight is Scribus.
[00:39:40] Memo’s spotlight is humaaans.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.  Today, we have the wonderful Jenn Kotler joining us! Jenn is a User Experience Designer at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), where she designs data search and analysis tools for telescope missions including Webb, Hubble, TESS, and Kepler, all available for free use. Jenn fills us on what she does at MAST, the different types of data they look at, and how she uses this data in her job to make it accessible so everyone can do amazing science.  We learn more about sonification, Jenn’s thoughts of her ideal scenario of bringing the design community into the open source space, and something that’s difficult about being a designer in a space where there’s not a lot of other designers. Go ahead and download this episode now! 
[00:02:28] Jenn fills us on what she does at MAST.
[00:04:19] We learn how many people work in the archive with Jenn and how many people work at the Institute that have access to use the archive.
[00:05:36] Jenn explains about the different types of data they look at and how she facilitates that as a User Experience Designer.
[00:08:27] Find out how Jenn ended up working at MAST and in the science field, and how she focuses on the data after it’s gone through a pipeline and a lot of adjustments have already been done to it.
[00:12:45] We hear a great explanation of what sonification is and then Jenn talks about her experience with it, and there’s an actual audio of a sonification she plays.
[00:17:16] If they are using sound and light in terms of images, Richard wonders if Jen could combine them and have people play a video game where they walk through a world of seeing different visualizations.
[00:18:44] Jenn breaks down accessibility and how they want this data to be accessible and approachable to everyone, since it’s free.
[00:23:44] Django wonders how Jenn balances accessibility in the effort of producing a clean user experience for the max number of people. She explains the methods they’ve been using.
[00:27:41] Eriol asks Jenn to talk about her ideal scenario of bringing the design community into the open source space where she works, and whether design science fiction comes into that space.
[00:31:18] We find out what’s difficult for Jenn right now and what she wishes she could change for the better.
[00:37:25] Find out where you can follow Jenn on the web.
Quotes
[00:10:49] “If there’s a topic or subject you’re interested in it’s really great to explore and find the place that needs a designer but doesn’t even know it.”
[00:22:10] “If you’re able to use a computer there isn’t a great reason you shouldn’t be able to do astronomy if you have an interest in it.”
[00:29:30] “That was the thing that excited me about sonification initially, this idea of there’s so much value here and just an art, forget science, there’s a lot of cool things that could be made with this.”
[00:36:28] “In the past I struggled with feeling like I used up all this creative energy on something that is so boring and then I had nothing left for myself.”
Spotlight
[00:38:05] Eriol’s spotlight is a Coordinate Tool for No Man’s Sky called NMSCoordinates.
[00:38:44] Memo’s spotlight is a book that changed his life called, Nightfall.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we are very excited to have as our guest, Aaron Collier, who is a Technical Writer at Orbit, which is the design system for Kiwi.com. Aaron fills us in on what he does at Orbit, we’ll learn all about the process of writing documentation and designs systems, and how they get their contributors. He also explains why he doesn’t identify as a designer and he shares some struggles he’s had with the work that he does and the importance of having empathy. Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more! 
[00:01:46] Aaron tells us what he does at Orbit and how it started.
[00:05:05] How does Aaron decide what the upper limits of abstraction are for a design system and how does he decide what’s included and what’s not included?
[00:06:35] We learn more about how the process of writing documentation and helping other people know how decisions were made works on a design system.
[00:09:00] Find out what koumpounophobia is and how Aaron makes it simpler and less scary for people to learn.
[00:11:19] In regard to logic trees and technical writing and documentation, Django wonders how Aaron decides how much justification is needed.
[00:13:47] Aaron tells us what’s hard for him about his work and what he struggles with.
[00:17:41] How does Orbit get all their contributors?
[00:20:08] Richard wonders if why Orbit doesn’t have a community manager.
[00:22:33] We learn how Aaron goes about deciding who to attract to their project.
[00:25:46] Aaron explains why he doesn’t identify as a designer. 
[00:30:04] How does Aaron interface with a larger ecosystem given what he’s doing to make sure the doc writing is more sustainable?
[00:33:27] Aaron tells us about contributing back to open source tools which have been used in building up his template and if he thinks about design contributions as being a unit of currency within the larger open source design system.
[00:37:17] Find out where you can follow Aaron online.
Quotes
[00:14:51] “It’s about having empathy for the situation that the other person is in when they’re reading your documentation.”
Spotlight
[00:37:58] Django’s spotlight is twin brothers, Martin and Carl Bridge, who were heads of the art department at his high school.
[00:38:49] Richard’s spotlights are Ms. Hojnicki, Orbit.love, and OrbitDB.
[00:39:33] Aaron’s spotlights are a previous high school Latin teacher, and a tool called Vale.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we have a fantastic guest joining us, Lozana Rossenova, who is a digital designer and researcher, as well as an Associate Researcher at the Open Science Lab.  Lozana takes on her journey through her background in digital design, her role at the Open Science Lab and Wikibase.  Since she’s a designer as well as a researcher, she shares some great examples of how she navigated through these roles within the projects she was a part of. Lozana details the importance of advocating to other designers, why a more holistic approach to design education is important, and how we need to push institutions to get involved with their users. Go ahead and download this episode to find out much more!
[00:02:30] Lozana tells us her background, what she’s researching, and the work she’s doing.
[00:04:12] Since Lozana is involved in a lot of different organizations and initiatives, she explains how she balances it all.
[00:07:20] We hear some examples of situations Lozana finds herself in as a designer/researcher.
[00:12:15] How does Lozana go about advocating for design, better design, and design best practices?
[00:18:32] Memo wonders how we should leap forward with how we look at designers and if there should be more focus on education.
[00:25:52] Lozana explains how we can make the work visible that institutions do through open source.
[00:36:05] Find out where you can follow Lozana and her work online.
Quotes
[00:19:57] “Detail orientation and design and really focusing on information and structuring information is what guides my activities.”
[00:20:23] “Community management is where I see the next level of combining design for open source and project management.”
[00:22:36] “We can’t be completely stuck in our detail level orientation of beautiful layouts.”
[00:23:41] “My trifecta is change on the level of design, change on the level of education, but also change how institutions work.” 
[00:27:00] “Publishing makes a difference, even if no one reads it.”
[00:29:30] “Corporations can learn from institutions.”
Spotlight
[00:30:48] Memo’s spotlight is a project called Jamstack.
[00:31:18] Eriol’s spotlight is a tool called pose-search.
[00:32:12] Django’s spotlight is the Open Work in Academia Summit.
[00:33:13] Lozano’s spotlights are OpenRefine, Webrecorder, and SUCHO.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we have a fantastic guest joining us, Lozana Rossenova, who is a digital designer and researcher, as well as an Associate Researcher at the Open Science Lab.  Lozana takes on her journey through her background in digital design, her role at the Open Science Lab and Wikibase.  Since she’s a designer as well as a researcher, she shares some great examples of how she navigated through these roles within the projects she was a part of. Lozana details the importance of advocating to other designers, why a more holistic approach to design education is important, and how we need to push institutions to get involved with their users. Go ahead and download this episode to find out much more!</p>

<p>[00:02:30] Lozana tells us her background, what she’s researching, and the work she’s doing.</p>

<p>[00:04:12] Since Lozana is involved in a lot of different organizations and initiatives, she explains how she balances it all.</p>

<p>[00:07:20] We hear some examples of situations Lozana finds herself in as a designer/researcher.</p>

<p>[00:12:15] How does Lozana go about advocating for design, better design, and design best practices?</p>

<p>[00:18:32] Memo wonders how we should leap forward with how we look at designers and if there should be more focus on education.</p>

<p>[00:25:52] Lozana explains how we can make the work visible that institutions do through open source.</p>

<p>[00:36:05] Find out where you can follow Lozana and her work online.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:19:57] “Detail orientation and design and really focusing on information and structuring information is what guides my activities.”</p>

<p>[00:20:23] “Community management is where I see the next level of combining design for open source and project management.”</p>

<p>[00:22:36] “We can’t be completely stuck in our detail level orientation of beautiful layouts.”</p>

<p>[00:23:41] “My trifecta is change on the level of design, change on the level of education, but also change how institutions work.” </p>

<p>[00:27:00] “Publishing makes a difference, even if no one reads it.”</p>

<p>[00:29:30] “Corporations can learn from institutions.”</p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On this episode, we are excited to have as our guest, Taís Lessa, who is a Product Design Lead at Mozilla Corporation, working with the Pocket team. Our discussion today focuses on inclusion in the workplace for immigrants and newcomers. We also learn more about how Taís grew as a designer, being a newcomer in another country coming from Brazil, not feeling like her contributions were valued, and how she found the right fit for herself at Mozilla and the Pocket team she works with. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! 
[00:01:36] Taís tells us her background, what she finds most important in her work, what she does at Mozilla, and the team she’s working with.
[00:04:53] We find out how Taís ended up on the Pocket team and why she feels it’s the best place for her work right now.
[00:06:41] Taís details how she grew as a designer, how she grew as a newcomer in Canada coming from Brazil, and how these two paths weaved together.
[00:10:02] We hear what it was like for Taís, as well as the team at Mozilla, the openness and open source space around inclusion, across borders, across identities, and whether she found anything that was unique in that space.
[00:17:43] Taís explains where she thinks being a designer has been, if it’s something that she’s had to become in some way because of who she is, and the emotional experience she has being a designer. 
[00:23:47] Memo wonders how Taís thinks we can foster an environment to encourage people to be more themselves in open source and how they can encourage others to be themselves with a difference of opinions. 
[00:30:50] Eriol brings up the Hello Kitty project Taís talked about and how it’s such a great project to express creativity in open source.
[00:33:03] Richard wonders what tools Taís has in her toolbox for finding energy when it’s gone.
[00:34:53] Find out where you can follow Taís online.
Quotes
[00:07:41] “What excites me, what makes my eyes bright, is design.”
[00:13:14] “My contributions are valued from where I am from.”
[00:14:28] “The real value came when I started to be myself.”
[00:26:15] “As a designer, part of my job is to design the thing, but this is a little part. The big part is how to convince others this is the right thing to do.”
[00:29:15] “I use my strength as a designer to show the value of my ideas and convince people.”
Spotlight
[00:36:07] Richard’s spotlights is the book Ecce Romani, which is how he learned Latin.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On this episode, we are excited to have as our guest, Taís Lessa, who is a Product Design Lead at Mozilla Corporation, working with the Pocket team. Our discussion today focuses on inclusion in the workplace for immigrants and newcomers. We also learn more about how Taís grew as a designer, being a newcomer in another country coming from Brazil, not feeling like her contributions were valued, and how she found the right fit for herself at Mozilla and the Pocket team she works with. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! </p>

<p>[00:01:36] Taís tells us her background, what she finds most important in her work, what she does at Mozilla, and the team she’s working with.</p>

<p>[00:04:53] We find out how Taís ended up on the Pocket team and why she feels it’s the best place for her work right now.</p>

<p>[00:06:41] Taís details how she grew as a designer, how she grew as a newcomer in Canada coming from Brazil, and how these two paths weaved together.</p>

<p>[00:10:02] We hear what it was like for Taís, as well as the team at Mozilla, the openness and open source space around inclusion, across borders, across identities, and whether she found anything that was unique in that space.</p>

<p>[00:17:43] Taís explains where she thinks being a designer has been, if it’s something that she’s had to become in some way because of who she is, and the emotional experience she has being a designer. </p>

<p>[00:23:47] Memo wonders how Taís thinks we can foster an environment to encourage people to be more themselves in open source and how they can encourage others to be themselves with a difference of opinions. </p>

<p>[00:30:50] Eriol brings up the Hello Kitty project Taís talked about and how it’s such a great project to express creativity in open source.</p>

<p>[00:33:03] Richard wonders what tools Taís has in her toolbox for finding energy when it’s gone.</p>

<p>[00:34:53] Find out where you can follow Taís online.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:07:41] “What excites me, what makes my eyes bright, is design.”</p>

<p>[00:13:14] “My contributions are valued from where I am from.”</p>

<p>[00:14:28] “The real value came when I started to be myself.”</p>

<p>[00:26:15] “As a designer, part of my job is to design the thing, but this is a little part. The big part is how to convince others this is the right thing to do.”</p>

<p>[00:29:15] “I use my strength as a designer to show the value of my ideas and convince people.”</p>

<h4>Spotlight</h4>

<ul>
<li>[00:36:07] Richard’s spotlights is the book Ecce Romani, which is how he learned Latin.</li>
<li>[00:36:53] Eriol’s spotlight is a repository called Welcome to the Adulting is Hard Project.</li>
<li>[00:37:34] Memo’s spotlight is a video chat app called Chatmosphere.</li>

[00:09:51] Heiko talks about the backgrounds of the people that he mentors.
[00:12:57] Eriol is curious to know what kind of expectations designers or people that contribute design to the projects have about the team and what does the team mean to him and the rest of the folks in the project.
[00:17:05] Since LibreOffice has tons of contributors who contribute in other languages, Richard wonders how Heiko integrate different contributors from different languages. 
[00:19:02] We find out how you can contribute to the open source besides translations, if there’s a way to improve UX besides internalization and localization, and how the teams integrate other user experience with people from different backgrounds coming.

[00:02:40] We hear some of the challenges Carrie has come up against as a designer. 
[00:04:28] Carrie gives an example of how entry points into the projects are played out in a project in order to participate within the open source.
[00:06:57] Carrie explains about why she feels strongly about having a connection to people they are trying to help.
[00:08:01] Find out what design activities are.
[00:11:24] On the topic of data, we find out what kind of work Carrie is doing with data. 
[00:15:47] Eriol brings up the “should we” factor of watching people and wonders how we have conversations with organizations or open source projects where there is this uncertainly of being watched. Carrie tells us about the Clean Insights methodology.
[00:18:47] Memo asks Carrie to explain about these blind spots and how we can start filling out those gaps.
[00:20:14] Carrie gives an example of what kind of power Clean Insights can give to designers or tool builders.
[00:23:42] Eriol shares a story of how they view metrics, and Carrie tells us what it takes to make us better designers. 
Quotes
[00:07:06] “I feel very strongly about having a connection to people and having a connection to the people particularly that we say we’re trying to help.”
[00:07:34] “I constantly feel in a place of not really knowing what I’m doing, but maybe that’s healthy.”
[00:08:31] “I think everyone has different levels of comfort with creativity.”
[00:16:25] “Clean Insights is an analytic solution for digital product teams to safely gather insights about their users and it puts transparency and consent first.”
[00:21:42] “Don’t expect data to solve all [your] problems.”
[00:26:36] “What I want to encourage designers to do is to ask more questions.”
[00:27:34] “We’ve got to think about how it fits into people’s lives and we’ve got to know what that looks like in reality, and that’s what makes us better designers.”
Spotlight
[00:28:40] Memo’s spotlight is resonate.is, the community-owned music network.
[00:29:29] Eriol’s spotlight is Dracula Theme.
[00:30:06] Georgia’s spotlights are the USABLE Project, Spring conference season coming up and the USABLE team has a call for proposals for the UX Forum in April, and MozFest is coming up and there’s a proposal looking for examples of Consent.

Quotes
[00:00:57] “Honestly, it’s curiosity that led me to open source design.”
[00:05:12] “The open source community is tight, integrated, curious, intelligent, driven, and passionate to advance the collective.”

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we are joined by two guests, Christoph Ono, who is a UX and digital product designer from the Bitcoin Design Community, and Conor Okus, who works for Block, and is part of an initiative called Spiral, previously Square Crypto. On this episode, we are going all out looking at design for Bitcoin. Christoph and Conor fill us in about the Bitcoin Design Community, Bitcoin Design grants, and some challenges they had to face in the process of setting this community up.  They go in depth about the designer’s principles, the life cycle of a project, how they decided to focus on the onboarding side. Also, Conor tells us more about a video series he helped design to learn the basics of how Bitcoin works called, Hello Bitcoin. There is so much more to hear, so go ahead and download this episode now to find out!   
[00:01:27] Memo, Richard, Georgia, Conor, and Christoph give us a brief introduction of what they do, and we find out how Conor and Christoph know each other.
[00:10:02] Conor and Christoph fill us in on what’s so special about the Bitcoin Design grants and if they have seen a lot of design grants in the crypto space. Christoph tells us his plan on how he wants to pay it forward to make the grant possible for others.
[00:14:25] Find out more about the Bitcoin Design Community, how many contributors there are, how many designers have been funded, and the projects. 
[00:17:48] Christoph shares some of the challenges he’s run in to and how they scope a problem for contributors to work on.
[00:21:34] Christoph and Conor explain how they ended up focusing on the onboarding side.
[00:25:03] Georgia wonders if they have a sense of where people are coming from, and if they’re coming with a design background, or a Bitcoin background, and if that has an effect on what they’re able to do. 
[00:30:12] Christoph and Conor tell us more about the designer’s principles and what they’re doing to ensure they are praised for their work. 
[00:33:58] Find out more about the life cycle of a project and the design review process.  Conor tells us about a video series he does to help people understand how Bitcoin works called, Hello Bitcoin.
[00:36:40] We end with Conor telling us a little bit about Lightening Network, and Christoph shares what he would love to see next year for all creatives and designers.
[00:38:53] Find out where you can follow Conor and Christoph on the internet.
Quotes
[00:18:40] “I always try to encourage, share early, even if it’s rough, because someone else may help push you in the right direction.”
[00:27:25] “I would consider it an environment where designers have to work more closely to a protocol than another environment. You may have to move slower at times, and you may have to think through with more rigidity.  Setting that as an expectation is quite important.”
[00:29:10] “I have never worked with such principled designers and developers.”
[00:31:42] "Bitcoin is a lot more long-termed focused.”
[00:32:50] “One of the ideas is that any self-motivated designer can come in and say I have an idea, and then they do it because they’re excited about it.  And then there’s support.”
Spotlight
[00:39:43] Memo’s spotlight is a crypto tool called The Giving Block. 
[00:40:39] Georgia’s spotlights are a pattern library called, Decent Patterns, or Decentralization, off the shelf. Also, a workshop she hosted at Mozilla Festival called, “Explain Decentralization To Me.”
[00:41:41] Richard’s spotlight is Karri Saarinen.
[00:42:22] Christoph’s spotlight is Penpot.
[00:42:45] Conor’s spotlight is a project called, Bitcoin Smiles.

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:18:40] “I always try to encourage, share early, even if it’s rough, because someone else may help push you in the right direction.”</p>

<p>[00:27:25] “I would consider it an environment where designers have to work more closely to a protocol than another environment. You may have to move slower at times, and you may have to think through with more rigidity.  Setting that as an expectation is quite important.”</p>

<p>[00:29:10] “I have never worked with such principled designers and developers.”</p>

<p>[00:31:42] &quot;Bitcoin is a lot more long-termed focused.”</p>

<p>[00:32:50] “One of the ideas is that any self-motivated designer can come in and say I have an idea, and then they do it because they’re excited about it.  And then there’s support.”</p>

<h4>Spotlight</h4>

<ul>
<li>[00:39:43] Memo’s spotlight is a crypto tool called The Giving Block. </li>
<li>[00:40:39] Georgia’s spotlights are a pattern library called, Decent Patterns, or Decentralization, <em>off the shelf</em>. Also, a workshop she hosted at Mozilla Festival called, “Explain Decentralization To Me.”</li>
<li>[00:41:41] Richard’s spotlight is Karri Saarinen.</li>
<li>[00:42:22] Christoph’s spotlight is Penpot.</li>
<li>[00:42:45] Conor’s spotlight is a project called, Bitcoin Smiles.</li>

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.
Today, with Eriol, we have Kelsey Smith hosting as well, who is a UX Designer at Simply Secure.  We are very excited to have three guests joining us from different projects. Joining us are Lucie, who is working on I2P (Invisible Internet Project) as a UX Designer and researcher, Saptak is a Human Rights Concerned Web Developer, working as a contractor with Freedom of the Press Foundation, and Sadie, works on I2P, putting together the Usability Lab, and her work focus is on UX, design, and open source tools. Our discussions today are focused on the collaboration between designers and developers in open source software, and we learn more how these two functions interact with each other, and challenges they faced doing this collaboration work.  Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! 
[00:03:00] Eriol starts off by asking our guests how design, developer handoff, or collaboration work in their teams and projects, and how it got to be that way in their projects.
[00:06:14] Sadie tells us what it’s like to be this bridge between design and development and how it’s a little bit more developer led at the moment.
[00:09:50] Saptak fills us in on projects he works in and how design, developer handoff, and collaboration work in the projects he is a part of.
[00:15:41] Eriol wonders if there are other challenges that our guests have faced in doing this collaboration work, and to share examples of good processes and not so good processes. 
[00:20:02] Lucie explains her process of doing design around something that might have interesting, complicated, or unknown parts of the process that she might need to discover through conversation with the developers or technical teams.
[00:23:17] Sadie explains more how she facilitates conversations between the design and developer. 
[00:25:52] Kelsey asks Saptak what he would like designers to know about the dev processes specifically in this space versus other spaces, and he tells us about a tool that he’s found to be really helpful with developers and designers called Accessibility Bluelines.
[00:31:39] Sadie geos more in depth about design practices, security, and human rights.
[00:35:41] Lucie talks about the differences she has noticed with the collaboration process for developers and designers within open source compared to private software projects.
[00:38:41] Find out where you can follow Saptak, Sadie, and Lucie online. Also, Kelsey talks about a project they are working on called Useful Projects. 
Quotes
[00:04:11] “It really helps to have a little bit of knowledge of the technical aspect in order to design effectively.”
[00:05:25] “On our team specifically, Sadie has served as a bridge between design and development.”
[00:22:13] “That has been a part of the process of constantly reframing the question, drilling down to what you really want to know in order to do the design, because I don’t need to know all of the extraneous information that goes on the technical and developer side. I just need to know enough to do the design.”
[00:32:50] “Adding more definition and having better processes within the new user onboarding to encompass some of those philosophies behind open source, and why we have those things in place is very important.”
[00:36:11] “One of the companies I was at was IBM, and two things really stand out to me on the differences between open source and private, and they are capacity and hierarchy.”

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, as we wrap up 2021 and our first year of doing this podcast, we get reacquainted with each of our panelists as they give us a little history of their backgrounds and their involvement in open source. We talk about some of our favorite conversations, episodes, and guests that we had on, as well as the most memorable moments. We’re also looking forward to 2022 and discussions we would like to have for future episdoes that would be of interest to everyone listening out there. Also, if you want to be a guest or if you want to get more involved in these types of conversations we have on this podcast, we’re going to let you know where you can go to get plugged in to be a part of our community.

[00:07:52] Richard and Memo tell us their most favorite conversations, guests, and episodes that they really enjoyed this year.
[00:11:36] Eriol shares four things that are most memorable to her, which include the guests on this podcasts being from all different parts of the world, the diversity of what design means being covered so broadly, guests coming in talking about different communities, and conversations about what it means to be a designer.
[00:14:52] Georgia reflects on what this podcast was set up to accomplish and she wonders what else is on the panelists minds about conversations on what it means to be a designer, the state of sustaining open source design at the moment, and future discussions they want to have.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We’re really excited to have as our guest, Jérémy Landes, from the South of France, who’s a “Font Dude” or Type Designer, and he’s the leader of the graphic and type design, Studio Triple, based in Berlin. Today, Jérémy explains what he does as a type designer, how he incorporates the open source side of it, and the process of how to start building a font all the way to the end. We also find out how he feels about the ownership of what he creates, how he sees the boundaries between open source and collaboration, and his thoughts on what he would like to see happen in the future for design communities to be more open. Download this episode now to find out much more!
[00:01:57] Jérémy fills us in on what he does and since he does this for freelance, we find out where he gets his money as an open source designer.  
[00:04:52] Memo wonders how Jérémy’s path has been on being a designer and becoming a type designer and incorporating the open source side of it.  
[00:07:55] Eriol asks Jérémy to explain the process of how to start building a font or build some topography all the way to the end when the font is used. He also explains if it differs for commercial non-open source fonts and open source fonts.
[00:12:20] Jérémy used to be an open source type designer first, so Memo wonders if working in open source helped him reach more people, brought more attention to his work, and if it was a commercial channel to his professional career.
[00:14:20] Richard talks about one of the major benefits of using open source software is that you can fork a project, and he wonders if Jérémy has seen that happen in the font community.
[00:18:30] Find out how Jérémy sees the boundaries between open source and collaboration.  
[00:20:55] Eriol brings up the topic of is it still open source if you pay for it, and wonders how Jérémy feels about the ownership of what he creates and what kind of thoughts go through his head as he creates typefaces and fonts around the complex nature of ownership and design practice. 
[00:25:28] Jérémy shares his thoughts on what would like to see happen for design communities to be more open in the future.
[00:28:10] Find out where you can follow Jérémy online.
Quotes
[00:05:13] “I think that open source should have, especially in design, more eyeballs on it. Not everything makes sense as an open source project.” 
[00:15:10] “As the font community started to be more used to open source ways of working, and as the frontier between collaboration and open source starts to blend, we saw more forks happen.”
Spotlight
[00:29:03] Memo’s spotlight is Design Principles.
[00:29:32] Eriol’s spotlight is Kigelia, a Typeface for Africa.
[00:30:20] Richard’s spotlight is Coffee Table Typography. 
[00:30:51] Jeremy’s spotlights are ProcessWire and OSP.kitchen.

<p>[00:07:55] Eriol asks Jérémy to explain the process of how to start building a font or build some topography all the way to the end when the font is used. He also explains if it differs for commercial non-open source fonts and open source fonts.</p>

<p>[00:12:20] Jérémy used to be an open source type designer first, so Memo wonders if working in open source helped him reach more people, brought more attention to his work, and if it was a commercial channel to his professional career.</p>

<p>[00:14:20] Richard talks about one of the major benefits of using open source software is that you can fork a project, and he wonders if Jérémy has seen that happen in the font community.</p>

<p>[00:18:30] Find out how Jérémy sees the boundaries between open source and collaboration.  </p>

<p>[00:20:55] Eriol brings up the topic of is it still open source if you pay for it, and wonders how Jérémy feels about the ownership of what he creates and what kind of thoughts go through his head as he creates typefaces and fonts around the complex nature of ownership and design practice. </p>

<p>[00:25:28] Jérémy shares his thoughts on what would like to see happen for design communities to be more open in the future.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:05:13] “I think that open source should have, especially in design, more eyeballs on it. Not everything makes sense as an open source project.” </p>

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We’re really excited to have as our guest, Jérémy Landes, from the South of France, who’s a “Font Dude” or Type Designer, and he’s the leader of the graphic and type design, Studio Triple, based in Berlin. Today, Jérémy explains what he does as a type designer, how he incorporates the open source side of it, and the process of how to start building a font all the way to the end. We also find out how he feels about the ownership of what he creates, how he sees the boundaries between open source and collaboration, and his thoughts on what he would like to see happen in the future for design communities to be more open.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we have two amazing guests, Jin Guo and Jinghui Cheng from Montréal.  Jin is an Assistant Professor at McGill University in the School of Computer Science, and she received her Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame. She is particularly interested in the intersection between Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence. Jinghui is an Assistant Professor at Polytechnique Montréal, where he directs the Human Centered Design Lab. His research combines the field of Human-Computer Interaction with Software Engineering. Today, we hear about Jin’s grant she received from the Sloan Foundation, which is supporting the open source usability for scientific software.  Jin and Jinghui go in depth about things scientific researchers use, some common problems around usability, the different research methods they are using in their studies, and how they incorporate the community aspect to their research. Also, they share advice on how to get involved with research happening on open source.  Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more! 
[00:03:45] Jin explains more about the grant they were given from the Sloan Foundation.
[00:05:49] Find out what kinds of open source code scientific researchers use and some common problems around usability. 
[00:09:04] Jin and Jinghui tell us about the different research methods they are doing.
[00:12:41] Richard wonders what Jin and Jinghui are particularly interested in learning from their study that will help their future research and what are they trying to learn on an academic sense.
[00:17:47] Eriol wonders if Jin and Jinghui had similar challenges when researching open source projects. 
[00:22:15] Jin and Jinghui share their thoughts on incorporating the community aspect to their research.
[00:25:32] Richard wonders if Jin and Jinghui can share any ideas to designers, communities which have design focus, or open source in general, on how they can get involved with research happening on open source, besides reading papers, doing a PhD, or going to their workshops.  
[00:28:11] Eriol asks how Jinghui views end users as a kind of designer and what that might mean for how he’s doing his work, and if these workshops are a way of doing that. 
[00:30:25] Jin expands more on her interest in AI and how that’s going to work, and how she’s going to get AI to play with designers and open source communities.
[00:34:10] Find out where you can follow Jin and Jinghui on the internet.
Quotes
[00:05:16] “We’re hoping to use this grant to help advance scientific software usability, but also use the end result from our projects to benefit open source usability as a whole.”
[00:15:40] “For open source usability, I think the tooling is one aspect, but the ultimate goal for our improvement on the tooling is the mindset improvement.”
[00:18:38] “As a researcher, ideally we would need to make more frequent and iterative collaborations with open source projects by either interviewing them or having scientific project ideas. Balancing with them and to see what is the relevance of our research with their real concerns.”
[00:19:22] “One of the things we are currently planning on is to conduct some of the workshops that are going to invite the end users and the designers to be in the same place, to work together to observe their dynamics of communicating.”
[00:23:47] “What we hope is to learn the boundary of communication between those more stereotyped communities, but to make them feel welcomed to communicate with each other regardless of their title or role.”
[00:27:46] “Design conferences, they need to welcome more people rather than just really fashi fashionable flashy designers doing, well I don’t know, stuff for evil clients.” (Eriol)
Spotlight
[00:35:36] Memo’s spotlight is Jamstack.
[00:35:57] Eriol’s spotlights are FOSS Backstage and one of their favorite academia papers called, “Non-response, Social Exclusion, and False Acceptance:  Gatekeeping Tactics and Usability Work in Free-Libre Open Source Software Development,” by Mikko Rajanen, Netta Iivari, and Arto Lanamäki 
[00:37:17] Richard’s spotlight is JS Montreal.
[00:37:41] Jinghui’s spotlights are projects that influenced him and his research which are Atom, Jupyter notebook, and PyTorch.
[00:38:44] Jin’s spotlights are two projects that influenced her previous work and current work which are scikit-learn and Zotero.

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we have two amazing guests, Jin Guo and Jinghui Cheng from Montréal.  Jin is an Assistant Professor at McGill University in the School of Computer Science, and she received her Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame. She is particularly interested in the intersection between Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence. Jinghui is an Assistant Professor at Polytechnique Montréal, where he directs the Human Centered Design Lab. His research combines the field of Human-Computer Interaction with Software Engineering. Today, we hear about Jin’s grant she received from the Sloan Foundation, which is supporting the open source usability for scientific software.  Jin and Jinghui go in depth about things scientific researchers use, some common problems around usability, the different research methods they are using in their studies, and how they incorporate the community aspect to their research. Also, they share advice on how to get involved with research happening on open source.  Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more! </p>

<p>[00:03:45] Jin explains more about the grant they were given from the Sloan Foundation.</p>

<p>[00:05:49] Find out what kinds of open source code scientific researchers use and some common problems around usability. </p>

<p>[00:09:04] Jin and Jinghui tell us about the different research methods they are doing.</p>

<p>[00:12:41] Richard wonders what Jin and Jinghui are particularly interested in learning from their study that will help their future research and what are they trying to learn on an academic sense.</p>

<p>[00:17:47] Eriol wonders if Jin and Jinghui had similar challenges when researching open source projects. </p>

<p>[00:22:15] Jin and Jinghui share their thoughts on incorporating the community aspect to their research.</p>

<p>[00:25:32] Richard wonders if Jin and Jinghui can share any ideas to designers, communities which have design focus, or open source in general, on how they can get involved with research happening on open source, besides reading papers, doing a PhD, or going to their workshops.  </p>

<p>[00:28:11] Eriol asks how Jinghui views end users as a kind of designer and what that might mean for how he’s doing his work, and if these workshops are a way of doing that. </p>

<p>[00:30:25] Jin expands more on her interest in AI and how that’s going to work, and how she’s going to get AI to play with designers and open source communities.</p>

<p>[00:34:10] Find out where you can follow Jin and Jinghui on the internet.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:05:16] “We’re hoping to use this grant to help advance scientific software usability, but also use the end result from our projects to benefit open source usability as a whole.”</p>

<p>[00:15:40] “For open source usability, I think the tooling is one aspect, but the ultimate goal for our improvement on the tooling is the mindset improvement.”</p>

<p>[00:18:38] “As a researcher, ideally we would need to make more frequent and iterative collaborations with open source projects by either interviewing them or having scientific project ideas. Balancing with them and to see what is the relevance of our research with their real concerns.”</p>

<p>[00:19:22] “One of the things we are currently planning on is to conduct some of the workshops that are going to invite the end users and the designers to be in the same place, to work together to observe their dynamics of communicating.”</p>

<p>[00:23:47] “What we hope is to learn the boundary of communication between those more stereotyped communities, but to make them feel welcomed to communicate with each other regardless of their title or role.”</p>

<p>[00:27:46] “Design conferences, they need to welcome more people rather than just really fashi fashionable flashy designers doing, well I don’t know, stuff for evil clients.” (Eriol)</p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Our special guest today is Django Skorupa, who recently graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a degree in Industrial Design and is now working as a UI/UX Designer for the internal team at Open@RIT Academic Open Source Program Office (OSPO). We find out more about what Django is doing at Open@RIT, he explains how bad design keeps your community stagnated, and why he thinks design is kept separate from developers in the open source space. He also explains some things he’s struggling with and what he’s trying to learn, he goes in depth with his assessment of design, and he shares some great resources and advice if you are a new designer wanting to get involved in the open source community that helped him on his journey. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more! 
[00:01:50] Django tells us what kind of leap he took going from the industrial side into the much more collaborative, interactive way of working in the open source side of things. 
[00:08:13] Find out what Django is doing at Open@RIT.
[00:14:04] Richard wonders what open source kitchens Django plays in and if he does open source on his own how has that informed his own experience of also working with the OSPO.
[00:16:12] We learn how Django sees open source.
[00:18:46] Why does Django see the developers and designers kept so separate from each other in the open source space?
[00:22:20] Justin wonders what Django learned from his peers and other communities that he was working with while he was doing his teaching role and if anything surprised him when he went out and worked across these different communities and peers, and especially what he’s learned from Rahul Tuli. 
[00:26:10] Django tells us about some things he’s struggling with that he’s trying to learn. He mentions using Roboto font.
[00:30:14] We find out if Django has started teaching yet, what his future plans are, and his assessment of design.
[00:34:27] If you are a designer and want to get involved in the open source community, Django shares some resources, and a hot tip that has helped him in his journey. He mentions Red Hat as a great resource and why. 
[00:36:40] Find out where you can follow Django on the internet. 
Quotes
[00:17:21] “I’ve always seen open source as a subsection of open Asterisk.”
[00:17:52] “I think that as we move forward in the whole world, open in general is a humanitarian choice, because it is a support for people who cannot or don’t want to engage with the more closed forms of education, the more closed forms of thinking, the more closed forms of interaction.”
[00:21:08] “I changed my title when I was hired on as a UI/UX person from strategic designer to UI/UX and it was like the world immediately got brighter and more friendly.”
[00:28:48] “The biggest struggle is using open things, trying to make everything open when you are creative, and a lot of your tools are not open.”
[00:31:46] “I think that design is firmly 50/50 between skill and theory.” 
[00:32:37] “Design and making, while extremely similar and both parts of a process, are not the same thing.”
[00:32:45] “To design is to think about the broader scope of why something happens.”
[00:32:50] “Design is so much theory and so much consideration on a massive scale.”
[00:32:59] “It needs to be a proper balance between pragmatism and holistic view.”
[00:36:13] “Try and find places that are really transparent, try and find places that are into talking about what they do, try and find places that go on podcasts and talk about what they do, and then find those people and pick their brains and steal as much information as you possibly can from a conversation with them and write all of it down.” 
Spotlight
[00:37:15] Justin’s spotlight is Fedora Badges.
[00:38:15] Richard’s spotlight is a Justin Flory.
[00:39:45] Django’s spotlights are two open source projects: The League of Moveable Type and Unsplash.com.

<p>[00:32:37] “Design and making, while extremely similar and both parts of a process, are not the same thing.”</p>

<p>[00:32:45] “To design is to think about the broader scope of why something happens.”</p>

<p>[00:32:50] “Design is so much theory and so much consideration on a massive scale.”</p>

<p>[00:32:59] “It needs to be a proper balance between pragmatism and holistic view.”</p>

<p>[00:36:13] “Try and find places that are really transparent, try and find places that are into talking about what they do, try and find places that go on podcasts and talk about what they do, and then find those people and pick their brains and steal as much information as you possibly can from a conversation with them and write all of it down.” </p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, we have as our guest Oleg Nenashev, who is a Jenkins maintainer where he writes code, mentors contributors, and organizes community events. We find out more about Jenkins and what Oleg does for them. He fills us in on a portal that Jenkins created for onboarding new contributors, he shares advice on where designers can contribute but don’t know where to start, and we hear some challenges that Oleg faced as a maintainer, as well as his approach to face these challenges. Go ahead and download this episode to find out more! 
[00:01:11] Oleg tells us about himself, his current work with Jenkins, and more about the company. 
[00:05:36] We learn what kind of design things Oleg does in hardware design. 
[00:09:00] Oleg talks about his connection to designers in open source with all different kinds of backgrounds and he mentions other things he has done as far as research and mentoring students.  
[00:10:39] Oleg does research for Jenkins and Memo wonders how he approaches that kind of user research for Jenkins users. 
[00:14:52] Jenkins created a special portal for onboarding new contributors that we learn more about.
[00:17:54] Since there are a lot of designers that want to contribute but don’t know quite how to start, Oleg tells us there are two parts, to help potential contributors and the potential work items to find each other and mentoring people to achieve this.
[00:22:00] Oleg provides us with some numbers from Jenkins with how many installations and users across the world they have.
[00:24:05] When it comes to Jenkins projects being built, designed, and maintained by groups of people making different improvements, Eriol wonders how Oleg handles these challenges.
[00:27:12] We find out that Jenkins is interested in all kinds of contributions and Oleg explains the process. Also, he shares some advice to the UX or UI designers and graphic designers who want to get into this kind of work, what they can do to get in. 
[00:31:57] Oleg tells us challenges he faced as a maintainer and his approach to face these challenges.
Quotes
[00:09:00] “When we talk about open source communities, basically every kind of role is welcome.”
[00:09:08] “Because the open source community is huge and whatever background you have, whatever interest you have, you can find something to do there.”
[00:13:36] “We started doing inverse meetups, one that we basically organized and a user panel when we invite one or two users or user companies to present their story about Jenkins.” 
[00:32:22] “You need to have community leadership, and you need to have a community leadership onboarding process, which allows you to grow and scale as a community.”
Spotlight
[00:35:03] Memo’s spotlight is open source typefaces to experiment with on Open Foundry.
[00:35:41] Eriol’s spotlights are two HOTosm design repositories, design-strategy and HOT Design System.
[00:36:49] Perrie’s spotlight is the CHAOSS Project.
[00:37:29] Oleg’s spotlights are Apache Maven &amp; Community and FOSDEM.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Our special guest today is Abhishek Sharma, who is the head of a design company called ColoredCow.  He is currently managing one of the open source projects called Glific, which is a WhatsApp based open source communication platform for NGOs to have conversations with their community.   Abhishek shares his journey of self-discovery when he realized he really enjoyed design and problem solving, and not engineering.  He tells us about his role as Community Manager at Glific, and how listening to the communities is very important for designers who want to make meaningful, impactful products. We learn about what he wants to do in the future for the open source space with designers and he shares some “best practices” for designers to be able to collaborate with NGOs more.

Quotes
[00:07:41] “And I did a quick self-discovery where I wanted, I drew some Venn diagrams, figured out, okay, this is what I’m good at.”
[00:08:37] “I was really not good at it at the beginning, I was just full of ambition that: okay, this is what I wanted to do.”
[00:10:48] “I have started seeing my role as equating product management to actually being this community facilitator, and engagement creator for lack of a better word.”
[00:11:48] “It’s not really the tech or the solution, it’s really about the problem that the NGOs are solving, so it kind of gives them a space or the topic that there is a need with.”
[00:12:27] “We are actively building a support channel and community space where these NGOs can interact with each other, with their team, development team, design team, support team, and with each other so they can learn from each other.”
[00:18:47] “The thing that happens as a Community Manager role is it keeps increasing your empathy towards the users, towards the space, because as a designer, what I need to do is solve problems.”
[00:19:42] “I feel this role of being a Community Manager and listening to the communities is very important for all designers out there who want to make meaningful impactful products.”
[00:21:33] “I if you’re not telling the right story of the product, then also you lose a lot of the impact of the product.”
[00:26:29] “What ends up happening is when you create you first learn, but when you learn you’re not creating.”
[00:26:43] “It’s like a math problem: you can’t solve a problem just by reading math, you have to actually solve those problems.”
Spotlight
[00:33:56] Memo’s spotlight is a resource repository model called Nice Very Nice.
[00:34:35] Perrie’s spotlight is a new open source initiative called Open Source Stories.
[00:35:21] Richard’s spotlight is Tiny Cat, the online catalog for tiny libraries.

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.
We are very excited to have as our guest today, Aditya Patel, who is the Director of Product at HotWax Commerce, a startup company. He does a lot of stuff with designers and he’s a designer himself, so today he explains to us his approach to design. Aditya goes in depth about what HotWax Commerce is and how it works. He fills us in on the design system he created in Figma, and more about Storefront UI. Eriol brings up an interesting topic about “Heuristic Analysis.” Also, we hear Aditya’s approach to finding the balance between creating innovative designs and managing implementation challenges. There are so many interesting conversations today, so download this episode now to find out more!
[00:02:22] Aditya talks about what he does, how he ended up in HotWax Commerce, and more about the product for retailers.
[00:04:52] Aditya explains his idea for his approach to design and what he considers design at HotWax Commerce.
[00:07:28] We find out more about how HotWax Commerce collects feedback from consumers and how the key performance indicator (KPI) is used.
[00:11:44] We learn Aditya’s thoughts on the topic of sometimes not ever knowing who is using your open source and how this could be improved, and Eriol gives us their thoughts on this as well.
[00:14:08] After Aditya shares an example of what he does when he’s in that situation of “how do you tell if what you’ve done is useful without people coming back to you,” and Eriol talks about “Heuristic Analysis” which they recommend to designers to do on open source projects they want to contribute to.
[00:17:21] Aditya wrote a UI framework that’s part of a UI kit that he put into Figma and he explains how that works. He also tells us more about the Storefront UI made by Vue Storefront.
[00:22:06] Eriol asks Aditya to talk about how long it took him to do all these things with the framework, some of the conversations he had with his team about doing the work and implementing it and using it, and how beneficial this is for open source organizations to do this themselves.
[00:28:14] Richard wonders what the balance is between creating “innovative” designs and managing implementation challenges within this framework and how does he balance that.
[00:32:12] Aditya expands more about Behance and Dribbble and how they don’t functionally make sense with dead end workflows. Eriol wonders how these two things interlink.
[00:35:09] Find out where you can follow Aditya on the internet.

[00:32:16] “You know what’s funny is the first thought I have is the exact opposite of what I wrote, which is these people out there making designs that don’t actually do anything are probably the inspiration inside of when you’re thinking within the system.”
[00:32:40] “I think it wouldn’t be interesting if there were more people out there that were using all of these Dribbble and Behance designs if they were more like, oh, I use this design system and use it in a way that you’d never thought of.”
[00:33:33] “I think what you’re described is a really tricky problem. It’s a design culture problem potentially where wouldn’t it be beautiful if we celebrated designers using systems and using frameworks.”
[00:34:53] “I’m a bit of a dreamer when I think about these kinds of things, but the balance that you bring is much more like, this is how things could be, this is how things should be, this is the way in which this could be done, which is I think, fantastic!”

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.</p>

<p>We are very excited to have as our guest today, Aditya Patel, who is the Director of Product at HotWax Commerce, a startup company. He does a lot of stuff with designers and he’s a designer himself, so today he explains to us his approach to design. Aditya goes in depth about what HotWax Commerce is and how it works. He fills us in on the design system he created in Figma, and more about Storefront UI. Eriol brings up an interesting topic about “Heuristic Analysis.” Also, we hear Aditya’s approach to finding the balance between creating innovative designs and managing implementation challenges. There are so many interesting conversations today, so download this episode now to find out more!</p>

<p>[00:02:22] Aditya talks about what he does, how he ended up in HotWax Commerce, and more about the product for retailers.</p>

<p>[00:04:52] Aditya explains his idea for his approach to design and what he considers design at HotWax Commerce.</p>

<p>[00:07:28] We find out more about how HotWax Commerce collects feedback from consumers and how the key performance indicator (KPI) is used.</p>

<p>[00:11:44] We learn Aditya’s thoughts on the topic of sometimes not ever knowing who is using your open source and how this could be improved, and Eriol gives us their thoughts on this as well.</p>

<p>[00:14:08] After Aditya shares an example of what he does when he’s in that situation of “how do you tell if what you’ve done is useful without people coming back to you,” and Eriol talks about “Heuristic Analysis” which they recommend to designers to do on open source projects they want to contribute to.</p>

<p>[00:17:21] Aditya wrote a UI framework that’s part of a UI kit that he put into Figma and he explains how that works. He also tells us more about the Storefront UI made by Vue Storefront.</p>

<p>[00:22:06] Eriol asks Aditya to talk about how long it took him to do all these things with the framework, some of the conversations he had with his team about doing the work and implementing it and using it, and how beneficial this is for open source organizations to do this themselves.</p>

<p>[00:28:14] Richard wonders what the balance is between creating “innovative” designs and managing implementation challenges within this framework and how does he balance that.</p>

<p>[00:32:12] Aditya expands more about Behance and Dribbble and how they don’t functionally make sense with dead end workflows. Eriol wonders how these two things interlink.</p>

<p>[00:35:09] Find out where you can follow Aditya on the internet.</p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We have a very cool guest today, Justin Scherer, who has been designing software as a job for a decade or so, and he has done so for multi-national banks, national marketing campaigns, and small humanitarian not-for-profits. Lately, he’s been working on tech for crisis response and the humanitarian sector, as well as developer tools and fintech products. Today, Justin tells us his story of his pathway to getting into designing software, working with Hover, building the personal finance app called Stax.  He gives us an “exclusive” on how things are working with his design team,  how he wants them to work, and more about the operations.  He also goes in depth about how important the focus of research should be.  Download this episode to find out much more!
[00:01:37] Justin tells us about himself and what he’s working on right now, which is a personal finance app called Stax.
[00:02:39] We find out more about the product Stax, Hover Developer Services, and the team structure. 
[00:06:09] We find out the pathway to Justin’s career starting with his educational background. 
[00:10:52] Eriol is interested to know more about how the design team is made up, what kind of activities and roles they do, and how open source plays into that. 
[00:12:43] Justin gives an “exclusive” on how things are working now with his design team and how he wants them to work.  
[00:17:57] Georgia asks Justin to explain more about the operations since that always seems to be the biggest challenge. He talks about a research study they are doing now finding out what kind of coin people want to get paid in.
[00:22:04] Justin tells us about challenges he’s run into with implementing open source design contributions and the issue he had with this. 
[00:25:03] Memo asks Justin to talk more about how design research plays its role on the whole process they set up on Stax and is that design research work open source.
[00:29:13] Justin shares some critical breakthroughs that have come from the insights of research and how important research should be focused on.
Quotes
[00:11:11] “It’s a team of ten, so everyone does design, everyone does UX on some level, that’s like a sort of personal philosophy of mine, you know like great ideas or insights for a UX come from developers, they come from the CEO, they come from interns, they come from everybody.”
[00:14:12] “I think of analytics is almost like the truffle pig in the design process.”
[00:15:35] “And so I’d love to be able to source a lot of the sort of lower level, I think of like Small “D” and Big “D” Design.”
[00:22:51] “I think contributing the source back into the community is the thing that makes this not fiber.”
[00:23:37] “I used to work a major bank, you couldn’t even talk to a user without six NDAs and four levels of approval from sixteen VPs whose titles you can’t even pronounce.”
[00:25:23] “I think again, in order to have open source design contributions we need to have open source research, and this is one of the things that I’ve been struggling with a little bit.”
[00:26:53] “My focus has always been like get the research, get the insight, and that’s the thing that’s going to sell your design at the end of the day.” 
[00:27:41] “I always make the joke, like all the good ideas at Stax come from research.”
[00:33:07] “I think that’s actually the source of open source design really, it’s not the design files, it’s the knowledge and insight and those things that go around the design without which you’re essentially just copying other people on Dribbble at the end of the day.”
Spotlight
[00:34:07] Memo’s spotlight is an open source project called humaaans.
[00:35:03] Georgia’s spotlight is an open source project called PhishDetect.
[00:36:00] Eriol’s spotlight is a project from MozFest 2018 called Xenshana.
[00:36:43] Justin’s spotlight is open source hardware called Music Thing Modular by Tom Whitwell who is based in London.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. We have a very cool guest today, Justin Scherer, who has been designing software as a job for a decade or so, and he has done so for multi-national banks, national marketing campaigns, and small humanitarian not-for-profits. Lately, he’s been working on tech for crisis response and the humanitarian sector, as well as developer tools and fintech products. Today, Justin tells us his story of his pathway to getting into designing software, working with Hover, building the personal finance app called Stax.  He gives us an “exclusive” on how things are working with his design team,  how he wants them to work, and more about the operations.  He also goes in depth about how important the focus of research should be.  Download this episode to find out much more!</p>

<p>[00:01:37] Justin tells us about himself and what he’s working on right now, which is a personal finance app called Stax.</p>

<p>[00:02:39] We find out more about the product Stax, Hover Developer Services, and the team structure. </p>

<p>[00:06:09] We find out the pathway to Justin’s career starting with his educational background. </p>

<p>[00:10:52] Eriol is interested to know more about how the design team is made up, what kind of activities and roles they do, and how open source plays into that. </p>

<p>[00:12:43] Justin gives an “exclusive” on how things are working now with his design team and how he wants them to work.  </p>

<p>[00:17:57] Georgia asks Justin to explain more about the operations since that always seems to be the biggest challenge. He talks about a research study they are doing now finding out what kind of coin people want to get paid in.</p>

<p>[00:22:04] Justin tells us about challenges he’s run into with implementing open source design contributions and the issue he had with this. </p>

<p>[00:25:03] Memo asks Justin to talk more about how design research plays its role on the whole process they set up on Stax and is that design research work open source.</p>

<p>[00:29:13] Justin shares some critical breakthroughs that have come from the insights of research and how important research should be focused on.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:11:11] “It’s a team of ten, so everyone does design, everyone does UX on some level, that’s like a sort of personal philosophy of mine, you know like great ideas or insights for a UX come from developers, they come from the CEO, they come from interns, they come from everybody.”</p>

<p>[00:14:12] “I think of analytics is almost like the truffle pig in the design process.”</p>

<p>[00:15:35] “And so I’d love to be able to source a lot of the sort of lower level, I think of like Small “D” and Big “D” Design.”</p>

<p>[00:22:51] “I think contributing the source back into the community is the thing that makes this not fiber.”</p>

<p>[00:23:37] “I used to work a major bank, you couldn’t even talk to a user without six NDAs and four levels of approval from sixteen VPs whose titles you can’t even pronounce.”</p>

<p>[00:25:23] “I think again, in order to have open source design contributions we need to have open source research, and this is one of the things that I’ve been struggling with a little bit.”</p>

<p>[00:26:53] “My focus has always been like get the research, get the insight, and that’s the thing that’s going to sell your design at the end of the day.” </p>

<p>[00:27:41] “I always make the joke, like all the good ideas at Stax come from research.”</p>

<p>[00:33:07] “I think that’s actually the source of open source design really, it’s not the design files, it’s the knowledge and insight and those things that go around the design without which you’re essentially just copying other people on Dribbble at the end of the day.”</p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.  Today, we have a really great guest with us, Andy Gonzalez, who works as UX Designer at Kaleidos Open Source and he collaborates with different design schools as a teacher and mentor. Kaleidos is a company that creates disruptive digital platforms, driven by a positive impact of technology on society, and is now focused on Penpot and Taiga, two open source platforms meant for digital product teams. Andy tells us all what drove Kaleidos to build an open source platform, and more about how Penpot and Taiga were created.  We also find out what Andy sees in the future for collaboration, he explains four things that they consider contributions from a community member for Penpot, and if you’re interested in making contributions to Penpot, Andy explains where you can do that. Download this episode now to find out much more!
[00:01:45] Andy tells us about himself and he got involved in his career.
[00:04:02] Memo wonders how Andy got involved in open source stuff.
[00:07:14] Eriol asks Andy to talk about his experience with education, specifically about what he thinks about how designers are taught, either in education or when they self- teach in terms of tooling and software. Also, where does he see the culture of designers moving towards when we start to build more open source tooling.
[00:10:44] Andy tells us more about Kaleidos, Penpot, and Taiga.
[00:12:05] We learn from Andy what people are doing with these design tools that are making it more inclusive.  
[00:15:54] Memo asks Andy how Kaleidos decided to invest themselves in building this platform.
[00:19:24] Andy explains four things that they consider contributions from a community member for Penpot, and Memo explains what they are doing at Open Collective with contributions.
[00:25:13] What does Andy see in the future for collaboration?
[00:28:10] Perrie wonders where people can make contributions to Penpot, and Andy tells us. 
Quotes
[00:04:48] “When I think about that, I think that is a bit sad because to be honest I also have worked with open source tools.”
[00:05:59] “It was a journey and now I can say I am fully committed to open source projects and to the open source committee as well.”
[00:08:48] “Because, well in general times, I still believe that the tool should not be important, but the truth is that it is, and the tool is also a political space which is something that we usually forget.”
[00:10:00] “We are trying to break this, we are trying to break this model and we are trying to build a tool that helps the inclusion of the students, on every process, on every work done that they can share.”
[00:18:55] “We really want the designers to be first class citizens in the open source design worlds which we believe that is something that is not happening right now.”
[00:26:32] “There is a pain, there is a true pain when connecting all the dots, when connecting calls to design, design to calls were not in content to your designs.”
Spotlight
[00:30:10] Andy’s spotlight is Pure Data Software for visual programming. 
[00:31:03] Perrie’s spotlight is Open Source Community Africa Festival.
[00:31:38] Eriol’s spotlight is a tool called Bitsy, a pixel game creator, by Le-doux.
[00:32:40] Memo’s spotlight is a book called Interaction of Color by Josef Albers.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers.  Today, we have a really great guest with us, Andy Gonzalez, who works as UX Designer at Kaleidos Open Source and he collaborates with different design schools as a teacher and mentor. Kaleidos is a company that creates disruptive digital platforms, driven by a positive impact of technology on society, and is now focused on Penpot and Taiga, two open source platforms meant for digital product teams. Andy tells us all what drove Kaleidos to build an open source platform, and more about how Penpot and Taiga were created.  We also find out what Andy sees in the future for collaboration, he explains four things that they consider contributions from a community member for Penpot, and if you’re interested in making contributions to Penpot, Andy explains where you can do that. Download this episode now to find out much more!</p>

<p>[00:01:45] Andy tells us about himself and he got involved in his career.</p>

<p>[00:04:02] Memo wonders how Andy got involved in open source stuff.</p>

<p>[00:07:14] Eriol asks Andy to talk about his experience with education, specifically about what he thinks about how designers are taught, either in education or when they self- teach in terms of tooling and software. Also, where does he see the culture of designers moving towards when we start to build more open source tooling.</p>

<p>[00:10:44] Andy tells us more about Kaleidos, Penpot, and Taiga.</p>

<p>[00:12:05] We learn from Andy what people are doing with these design tools that are making it more inclusive.  </p>

<p>[00:15:54] Memo asks Andy how Kaleidos decided to invest themselves in building this platform.</p>

<p>[00:19:24] Andy explains four things that they consider contributions from a community member for Penpot, and Memo explains what they are doing at Open Collective with contributions.</p>

<p>[00:25:13] What does Andy see in the future for collaboration?</p>

<p>[00:28:10] Perrie wonders where people can make contributions to Penpot, and Andy tells us. </p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:04:48] “When I think about that, I think that is a bit sad because to be honest I also have worked with open source tools.”</p>

<p>[00:05:59] “It was a journey and now I can say I am fully committed to open source projects and to the open source committee as well.”</p>

<p>[00:08:48] “Because, well in general times, I still believe that the tool should not be important, but the truth is that it is, and the tool is also a political space which is something that we usually forget.”</p>

<p>[00:10:00] “We are trying to break this, we are trying to break this model and we are trying to build a tool that helps the inclusion of the students, on every process, on every work done that they can share.”</p>

<p>[00:18:55] “We really want the designers to be first class citizens in the open source design worlds which we believe that is something that is not happening right now.”</p>

<p>[00:26:32] “There is a pain, there is a true pain when connecting all the dots, when connecting calls to design, design to calls were not in content to your designs.”</p>

<h4>Spotlight</h4>

<ul>
<li>[00:30:10] Andy’s spotlight is Pure Data Software for visual programming. </li>
<li>[00:31:03] Perrie’s spotlight is Open Source Community Africa Festival.</li>
<li>[00:31:38] Eriol’s spotlight is a tool called Bitsy, a pixel game creator, by Le-doux.</li>
<li>[00:32:40] Memo’s spotlight is a book called <em>Interaction of Color</em> by Josef Albers.</li>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today, our special guest is Kartik Choudhary, who is a Front-End Web Application and Design Engineer, with a focus on progressive enhancements and creativity.  Kartik worked on Facebook’s React project through the MLH Fellowship and he tells us all about that today. He shares his ideas for ways Fellowship programs could be designed differently, being a mentor for students, the effects that contributions to open source has done to his career, and a blog he wrote about it. Also, Kartik tells us about a Developer Folio he is working on that is in dire state of needing design contributions.  Find out how you can help and download this episode to find out much more! 
[00:01:24] Kartik tells us all about himself, what he does, and how he worked on Facebook’s React project through the MLH Fellowship. He goes in depth what he did there and what he took away from that experience.
[00:04:41] Eriol asks Kartik to talk about what it was like going into a Fellowship and what kind of conversations did he have around design or conversations you had to run the design aspects of open source within the fellowship. Also, if there were any other people with design knowledge there and if his mentors knew much about the process of adding design in the open design process.
[00:07:08] Memo wonders what kind of resources Kartik relies on most in terms of design work, and Kartik talks about the program being more focused on developing and coding.
[00:10:00] Find out from Kartik if he could have the fellowships be a certain way, how would he design these programs. 
[00:12:01] We learn Kartik’s thoughts on how to make a collaboration on the projects accessible for everyone, and he talks about being a mentor.
[00:14:21] Kartik tells us about the first moment when he started to really get into the design side of things and learn more.
[00:15:56] Kartik mentions that he realized that the user experience was poor on websites he built, and Memo wonders what hints he found showing that it wasn’t right. 
[00:16:58] Perrie wonders what effects does Kartik think that contributions to open source has done to his career, and he explains a blog he wrote called, “Building a Developer Profile using Open Source.”
[00:19:37] Eriol wonders how we can communicate to designers about the potentials of open source for their portfolio and how would Kartik start to convince a designer to contribute to an open source project.
[00:21:51] Learn about a design portfolio that Kartik’s been working on that’s in a dire state of needing design contributions. 
Quotes
[00:03:50] “So, it was apart from being mentorship experience, it was a collaborative experience which kind of made it a lot better than the usual programs.”
[00:11:16] “I think similar programs should also exist for onboarding design students to projects so this would create sort of like a healthy community in open source software so design beginners can also feel they’re included and that they’re contributing.”
[00:18:34] "I think building a career or building a portfolio through open source should also be an option to designers.”
[00:22:35] “In general, just hang around in developer communities, even if there are small ones, there are generally a lot of passionate people who are, you know, just willing to work on a project together, and there are a lot of them.”
[00:23:49] “Like you said, designers have to internally infiltrate groups.  I think that is the current state of things, but it doesn’t have to be that way.”
[00:23:58] “So, the more open source design mentorship programs, or if you push design into current mentorship programs, I think the more students are going to become normalized with having designers on their team, and the students are going to be probably the next open source maintainers.” 
Spotlight
[00:24:42] Kartik’s spotlight is a project he’s maintaining called Developer Folio.
[00:25:14] Eriol’s spotlight is Patternfly.org.
[00:25:59] Memo’s spotlight is Coop Design system and their Design principles.

<p>[00:23:58] “So, the more open source design mentorship programs, or if you push design into current mentorship programs, I think the more students are going to become normalized with having designers on their team, and the students are going to be probably the next open source maintainers.” </p>

Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. On today’s episode, we have as our guest, Cristina Chumillas, who is a Front-end Developer at Lullabot and UX Core Maintainer at Drupal.  We will find out how Cristina got into the design field, and how she got involved in working with Drupal and Lullabot. She tells us how her experience has been as a designer who has contributed code and design, and what Drupal does to recognize contributors of all types. Cristina shares some great advice if you are a young designer just starting out. Also, find out the company that is the biggest contributor to Drupal and more about Design4Drupal and what they focus on. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out much more, and if you’re interested please subscribe! 
[00:01:30] Cristina tells us about herself and how she got into working in the design world. She also tells us how she got involved in working with Drupal.
[00:04:52] Eriol wonders if Cristina ever contributed code and if she can share an experience being a designer who has contributed code and contributed design and the differences.
[00:08:26] As Cristina formalizes the UX working group, we hear how her experience has been of people seeing her as a designer and seeing that working as the design group who makes all the design decisions.
[00:10:19] Eriol asks if Cristina’s had painful conversations or joyful ones with trying to advocate for really great user experience. 
[00:11:00] Since contributions are now sponsored and there’s a lot of paid and unpaid work, Cristina tells us how this enters into the conversation of who has more say and who’s heard more.
[00:13:52] Memo wonders how a project like Drupal can stay independent from big sponsors. 
[00:15:35] Cristina tells us about Lullabot. 
[00:17:23] We learn from Caristina the reason she went to work for Drupal and how the conversations about contributing to open source started with them.
[00:19:23] There’s a story going on that there’s a perception in the industry that open source is done by a hobbyist, and Richard is curious to know how Cristina feels about this story.  She also tells us what Drupal does and what she does to recognize contributors of all types.
[00:22:24] Eriol brings up contribution recognition and asks Cristina if she’s noticed or does she think there are differences in how designers want to be recognized as contributors, are there different values that designers have when they’re contributing to open source, and is there a way to grow that, encourage that, and support that. 
[00:24:23] Cristina tells us about an event called “Design4Drupal” and what they focus on. Eriol also wonders if there are other things that Cristina would like to see and what her “wishlist” is. 
[00:27:43] Listen to advice from Cristina if you’re a young designer just starting out.
[00:30:05] Find out where you can follow Cristina on the internet and where you can get involved with design in Drupal. 
Quotes
[00:12:14] “So, the companies that had a bigger budget to actually pay for this contributor were actually the ones that were having bigger projects so the features that made him were the ones that were needed for bigger projects.”
[00:12:38] “And sadly this means that are not as many freelancers out there as there were anymore.”
[00:20:52] “That’s really a recent change that we’ve had in the Drupal community.  Actually, there’s a blog post.” (link below) 
[00:22:43] “What I usually see when I see designers that really don’t know the communities, like I really don’t care about Drupal’s contributions. It’s something that they really don’t mind, they really don’t understand or need, unless they are paid by a company.”
[00:23:10] “Also getting involved in a big project, it takes a lot of time.  It’s not like you can just dig into the project and understand what you need to do in like two hours. You probably need one or two days to understand the project, understand the need of that specific thing.”
Spotlight
[00:32:40] Memo’s spotlight is the first open source project he used called Opendesk.
[00:33:27] Richard’s spotlight is Extinction Rebellion.
[00:34:08] Eriol’s spotlight is an article called, “Design APIs like you design User Experience.”
[00:35:15] Cristina’s spotlight is a project called Variablefonts.io.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today we have as our guest, Bryan Paget, who is a Data Scientist for Health Canada. We find out what Bryan does as a Data Scientist,  his interest in Linux, his ideas on consistency and expression existing within open source, and what design means to him. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out much more, and if you’re interested please subscribe!
[00:02:16] Bryan tells us what he does as a Data Scientist. 
[00:03:12] Eriol talks about data cleaning and how tricky it is to understand the best ways to facilitate it, and Bryan talks about data catalogs. 
[00:05:45] Eriol asks Bryan if he’s had the same experience with being excited about projects such as complex data systems, complex backend systems, or operating systems.  
[00:06:51] We learn more about Bryan’s interest in Linux and what sparks these conversations he has about open source and design.
[00:09:55] Richard asks Bryan how we could help conversations be less long and exhausting and make it easier for people to have the space and energy to engage in ways that help them feel like they’re accomplishing something. Bryan and Eriol share their thoughts on the platform usage.
[00:17:33] Bryan tells us why he uses Linux.
[00:19:38] Richard wonders how Bryan would define designer, and then to define what design is for him. 
[00:20:41] Eriol and Bryan have a discussion on the subject of consistency and expression existing within the open source.
[00:24:01] Eriol talks about something they have struggled with and that is seeing a lot of resistance by designers wanting to contribute to a systems-based approach to open source tools.
[00:28:54] Eriol asks Bryan his thoughts on how to engage open source developers in design thinking, what are ways in which he wants to learn more, and what would he ask Eriol, who’s an open source designer, to do for him.  
[00:33:19] Find out where you can follow Bryan online.
Quotes
[00:17:57] “So I think it’s just about being able to do things the way I want and be able to express myself the way I want.  That’s like a common theme throughout my life is I like to just be myself and do what I want within reason.”
[00:20:16] “I want to use words like curation and choice, like there’s something about I have a certain vision or a feeling, and I want to produce something that reflects that.” 
[00:20:25] “But design is also a bit more functional that pure art. That was a huge rift actually when I went to art schools.”
Spotlight
[00:34:03] Richard’s spotlight is Anki.
[00:34:22] Eriol’s spotlight is Dark Patterns Tip Line. 
[00:35:29] Bryan’s spotlight is Libre Graphics Meeting.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today we have as our guest, Gleb Sabirzyanov, Designer and Digital Maker of all things.  Gleb is currently doing all things related to Figma. He tells us about the plugins he built, Blend and Master, a project he started working on called Pink Turtles, and where he sees the future of Figma evolving in the next couple of years.  Go ahead and download this episode now to find out much more, and if you’re interested please subscribe!
[00:01:14] Gleb tells us more about himself and how he started working in open source. He talks about two plugins he built called Blend and Master.
[00:03:10] How did Gleb get involved into the world of design? 
[00:05:28] Gleb talks about how his relationship with Figma has been evolving.
[00:08:01] We learn how Figma works as a platform for designers as well as how they enable you to build plugins. 
[00:09:55] Richard wonders what Gleb is using the tools for that he’s building and how does he make sure that he’s approaching the need of people who are using Figma to build their own websites if he’s just building plugins.
[00:11:45] Memo asks Gleb about the future of Figma and how he sees it evolving in the next couple of years.
[00:14:51] Gleb talks about designers working on open source but using tools that are not open source, and Memo shares more about the Figma community with us.
[00:19:35] Gleb shares his views on open design and a project he started working on called Pink Turtles.
[00:24:27] Memo asks Gleb how we can bring all of the talented people into the design comfort zone and make them realize that they are creative and that they can produce designs by themselves.
[00:27:59] Find out where you can follow Gleb on the internet.
Quotes
[00:11:51] “I think Figma is an interesting tool and an interesting company because it changed the design industry pretty heavily.  It inspired designers to be more open in their process.”
[00:12:57] “But, in the future I think it will be even more about collaboration and openness of the design process.”
[00:14:22] “We usually have these conversations around when to use open source tools and how to balance your life with your stack of tools and say that you support open source, but we actually use tools that are not open source by definition.”
[00:23:51] “But Gleb is right, there should be like a lot more other players out there thinking with the same rules or even, but you know, maybe a different set of rules of just how to create ways of designing more in the open.”
[00:24:08] “I think that would be a really nice design prompt, to think about ideas of tools and projects that help designers and non-designers which is really important for designer teams all over, you know, how to include non-designers into the design process.”
[00:27:44] “But also if somebody is interested in design, in like visual aspect of it, people can of course learn from the designers and from their decisions and maybe help contribute to the project as well.”
[00:31:04] “I just love how Figma is seizing all of the situation to, like gather more people around the design team because this tool for me is to include more people of the team that are not designers, which I think is great.” 
Spotlight
[00:28:53] Richard’s spotlight is a post by Justin Jackson called, “This is a web page.”
[00:29:37] Gleb’s spotlight is VK Project on Figma community. 
[00:30:28] Memo’s spotlight is a new Figma product called FigJam.

<p>Memo Esparza | Richard Littauer</p>

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! The podcast where we talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Today we have as our guest, Gleb Sabirzyanov, Designer and Digital Maker of all things.  Gleb is currently doing all things related to Figma. He tells us about the plugins he built, Blend and Master, a project he started working on called Pink Turtles, and where he sees the future of Figma evolving in the next couple of years.  Go ahead and download this episode now to find out much more, and if you’re interested please subscribe!</p>

<p>[00:01:14] Gleb tells us more about himself and how he started working in open source. He talks about two plugins he built called Blend and Master.</p>

<p>[00:03:10] How did Gleb get involved into the world of design? </p>

<p>[00:05:28] Gleb talks about how his relationship with Figma has been evolving.</p>

<p>[00:08:01] We learn how Figma works as a platform for designers as well as how they enable you to build plugins. </p>

<p>[00:09:55] Richard wonders what Gleb is using the tools for that he’s building and how does he make sure that he’s approaching the need of people who are using Figma to build their own websites if he’s just building plugins.</p>

<p>[00:11:45] Memo asks Gleb about the future of Figma and how he sees it evolving in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>[00:14:51] Gleb talks about designers working on open source but using tools that are not open source, and Memo shares more about the Figma community with us.</p>

<p>[00:19:35] Gleb shares his views on open design and a project he started working on called Pink Turtles.</p>

<p>[00:24:27] Memo asks Gleb how we can bring all of the talented people into the design comfort zone and make them realize that they are creative and that they can produce designs by themselves.</p>

<p>[00:27:59] Find out where you can follow Gleb on the internet.</p>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>[00:11:51] “I think Figma is an interesting tool and an interesting company because it changed the design industry pretty heavily.  It inspired designers to be more open in their process.”</p>

<p>[00:12:57] “But, in the future I think it will be even more about collaboration and openness of the design process.”</p>

<p>[00:14:22] “We usually have these conversations around when to use open source tools and how to balance your life with your stack of tools and say that you support open source, but we actually use tools that are not open source by definition.”</p>

<p>[00:23:51] “But Gleb is right, there should be like a lot more other players out there thinking with the same rules or even, but you know, maybe a different set of rules of just how to create ways of designing more in the open.”</p>

<p>[00:24:08] “I think that would be a really nice design prompt, to think about ideas of tools and projects that help designers and non-designers which is really important for designer teams all over, you know, how to include non-designers into the design process.”</p>

<p>[00:27:44] “But also if somebody is interested in design, in like visual aspect of it, people can of course learn from the designers and from their decisions and maybe help contribute to the project as well.”</p>

<p>[00:31:04] “I just love how Figma is seizing all of the situation to, like gather more people around the design team because this tool for me is to include more people of the team that are not designers, which I think is great.” </p>

[00:04:15] Jan tells us what projects he did with art students and design students around open source.
[00:08:00] We learn about Jan’s PhD in anthropology and what he’s doing there. He also explains “nerd culture.”
[00:12:56] Eriol asks Jan to speak about their work and investigation into open source culture, UX Design culture, and design culture specifically, also the cultural overlaps and their work there.
[00:17:20] Eriol wonders if Jan thinks this culture is shifting and what he has noticed changing in the ten years of being involved in various different projects.  
[00:20:59] Richard mentions since Jan works a lot with recipes and methods trying to figure out how people are working together, he wonders what Jan thinks a better system might include.
[00:25:19] We find out what Jan thinks about what the open source design movement is doing right now, where he sees it going in the future, and the different work he does as well. Eriol shares a recent mentoring experience they had recently.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! On this podcast, we will talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we as coders, work with other designers. Joining us today, our guest is Smera Goel. Smera was previously an open source design intern through the Outreachy Internship Program and contributed with the Fedora Project on a couple of different projects and other things throughout the open source academia world that we’ll be talking about with her. Also, we will learn about the Infographics project, the Fedora Zine project that she started, and what role mentorship plays in working together with other people collaboratively on design projects. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more, and if you’re interested please subscribe!
[00:02:36] Smera tells us how she discovered the design world, what got her into this kind of work, and all about the Outreachy Program and the Fedora Project.
[00:05:14] We learn from Smera how she always loved being an artist and loved tech since she was a child, and the process of picking your college major in India.  
[00:07:22] Richard wonders when Smera joined Outreachy and was involved in Fedora, did she have any difficulties being a designer in that community and not just being a coder, and how did she manage the two competing interests.
[00:08:54] Smera talks about the Infographics project, what some of the goals were for it, and how it was such a helpful tool for all the different projects. 
[00:12:12] Memo wonders what is the magical thing that makes Smera so excited, besides being a designer. She also tells us what kind of things she does in her everyday life and the connection process with the Fedora Project.
[00:16:01] Richard asks Smera if she can talk about using Hindi or other languages, if there is awareness for open source at her university in India, and if she feels like it’s becoming more well-known in the student world of technology.
[00:19:30] Smera shares with us her idea of open source design as a professional job or as a business, as opposed to just being something she does with her volunteer time. 
[00:21:33] We learn all about the Fedora Zine project that Smera started, how she managed all the different feedback and ideas that people came with, and how she turned it into something that she shared back with the community.   
[00:23:18] Richard wonders what Smera is super excited about in the future when she has her free time back and how is going to bring her particular version of open source design. 
[00:25:01] Smera explains what role mentorship plays in terms of the design process and working together with other people collaboratively on design projects.
[00:27:56] Find out where you can follow Smera on the internet.
Spotlight
[00:28:30] Justin’s spotlight is the announcement of the new research from the Ford and Sloan Foundation funding. 
[00:29:03] Memo’s spotlight is Spline.
[00:29:46] Richard’s spotlight is his mentor, Alexis Palmer.
[00:30:31] Smera’s spotlight is Fedora Design, especially Fedora Badges, Zine, and Infographics.

Show Notes
Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! On this podcast where we will talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we, as coders, work with other designers. On today’s episode, we have our first guest, Agiri Abraham, Software Engineer and Team Lead at Softcom. He’s also on the Node.js Community Committee and a Cross-Project Council (CPC) member of the OpenJS Foundation. Agiri is passionate about engineering and solving problems. We will learn about what Agiri does at all his jobs, how he got involved with Node, challenges that he’s faced along the way, and much more.  Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more and if you’re interested, please subscribe!
[00:02:38] Agiri tells us what he does at his jobs.
[00:03:55] Find out how Agiri got involved with Node.
[00:06:14] Eriol brings up a conversation they had with Agiri almost a year ago, and Agiri recaps that conversation which was about developer designs relations.
[00:08:38] Justin asks Agiri if there’s another role that design plays in the JavaScript ecosystem in ways that people don’t think might typically be true. 
[00:11:36] We learn the types of difficult types of conversations Agiri’s had with other developers.
[00:14:10] Agiri tells us if the developer relationship roles in organizations could change to be more design friendly, what kind of ways would he like see those roles change.
[00:16:10] Eriol poses a question to Agiri regarding a current situation around the topic of problem-solving ideas with designers and wonders what he would do.
[00:18:49] Richard wonders how Agiri is implementing these high-level abstractions into his actual projects and how does he bring this to the CPC. Richard also asks him what he sees as possible venues to make the shift cost-effective and if he has any examples to help people understand how this will actually accelerate.
[00:23:54] Justin asks Agiri if he could tell us a story of a time when he was working with a community of people like open source design, and what that experience like to work with other people on a wider project and something that just wasn’t for yourself. 
[00:26:33] Richard wonders if Agiri has had the same experience as him with every time he’s run a NodeSchool, he notices that everyone else there is trying to figure it out with him. 
[00:27:49] Memo asks Agiri outside of his work, like with pixel pushing, how does he envision design happening between him and developers, and where design happens   outside screens and drawings, in his experience, how has non-pixel, non-graphical experience been with developers. Agiri also tells us how he designs with other people in conversations rather than in screen. 
[00:32:45] Agiri talks about the challenges of building the vocabulary and having conversations. 
[00:35:06] Find out where you can follow Agiri and his work on the internet.

<h4>Show Notes</h4>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sustain Open Source Design! On this podcast where we will talk about sustaining open source with design. Learn how we, as designers, interface with open source in a sustainable way, how we integrate into different communities, and how we, as coders, work with other designers. On today’s episode, we have our first guest, Agiri Abraham, Software Engineer and Team Lead at Softcom. He’s also on the Node.js Community Committee and a Cross-Project Council (CPC) member of the OpenJS Foundation. Agiri is passionate about engineering and solving problems. We will learn about what Agiri does at all his jobs, how he got involved with Node, challenges that he’s faced along the way, and much more.  Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more and if you’re interested, please subscribe!</p>

<p>[00:02:38] Agiri tells us what he does at his jobs.</p>

<p>[00:03:55] Find out how Agiri got involved with Node.</p>

<p>[00:06:14] Eriol brings up a conversation they had with Agiri almost a year ago, and Agiri recaps that conversation which was about developer designs relations.</p>

<p>[00:08:38] Justin asks Agiri if there’s another role that design plays in the JavaScript ecosystem in ways that people don’t think might typically be true. </p>

<p>[00:11:36] We learn the types of difficult types of conversations Agiri’s had with other developers.</p>

<p>[00:14:10] Agiri tells us if the developer relationship roles in organizations could change to be more design friendly, what kind of ways would he like see those roles change.</p>

<p>[00:16:10] Eriol poses a question to Agiri regarding a current situation around the topic of problem-solving ideas with designers and wonders what he would do.</p>

<p>[00:18:49] Richard wonders how Agiri is implementing these high-level abstractions into his actual projects and how does he bring this to the CPC. Richard also asks him what he sees as possible venues to make the shift cost-effective and if he has any examples to help people understand how this will actually accelerate.</p>

<p>[00:23:54] Justin asks Agiri if he could tell us a story of a time when he was working with a community of people like open source design, and what that experience like to work with other people on a wider project and something that just wasn’t for yourself. </p>

<p>[00:26:33] Richard wonders if Agiri has had the same experience as him with every time he’s run a NodeSchool, he notices that everyone else there is trying to figure it out with him. </p>

<p>[00:27:49] Memo asks Agiri outside of his work, like with pixel pushing, how does he envision design happening between him and developers, and where design happens   outside screens and drawings, in his experience, how has non-pixel, non-graphical experience been with developers. Agiri also tells us how he designs with other people in conversations rather than in screen. </p>

<p>[00:32:45] Agiri talks about the challenges of building the vocabulary and having conversations. </p>

<p>[00:35:06] Find out where you can follow Agiri and his work on the internet.  </p>
