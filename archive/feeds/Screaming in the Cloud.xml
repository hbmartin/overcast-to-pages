        <![CDATA[<p>How do you wrangle the chaos of AWS cost tools and live presentations? In this episode of Screaming in the Cloud, Corey Quinn is joined by AWS’s Bowen Wang and Matt Berk to break down their re:Invent talk and everything that almost went off the rails. From surprise tsunami alerts to last-minute feature changes, they explore the anxiety and art behind presenting at scale. They also look at how power user feedback shapes tools like the AWS Pricing Calculator, why storytelling matters more than specs, and what it’s like co-presenting with notes that say “make the rabbit joke.” They also discuss AWS’s internal planning process, how customers can get involved in talks, and where to catch them next.<br></p><p><strong>Show Highlights</strong></p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(1:38) The Duckbill Group sponsor read</p><p>(2:35) The importance of collecting feedback before launching a product </p><p>(4:52) The difference between the intended use of a product and how it’s actually used</p><p>(8:52) How Bowen and Matt were able to be so prepared for their presentation</p><p>(13:01) What many people don’t realize goes into practicing for a presentation</p><p>(17:14) How having a storyline helped Bowen and Matt facilitate better breakout sessions</p><p>(18:26) The Duckbill Group sponsor read</p><p>(21:02) The importance of being able to go with the flow during presentations</p><p>(22:42) Why knowing your audience is essential for having a good presentation</p><p>(24:32) Choosing between breadth and depth when giving presentations</p><p>(25:05) Bowen and Matt’s advice for people who want to have their opportunity to give a talk with an AWS service team</p><p>(34:22) How to keep up with Matt and Bowen<br></p><p><strong>About Matt Berk</strong></p><p>Matt Berk is an AWS Principal Technical Account Manager at based in Brooklyn who's passionate about storytelling, cloud technologies, and FinOps.

        <![CDATA[<p>How does one manage to simplify the complexities of the NAT Gateway? In this episode of "Screaming in the Cloud," Corey Quinn interviews Malith Rajapakse, a DevOps engineer who has recently received acclaim for his <a href="https://malithr.com/aws/natgateway/">blog post</a> discussing the Managed NAT Gateway.

Malith shares the story behind his popular post, his creative process, and his use of interactive diagrams and engaging content.

        <![CDATA[<p>What were you doing at the age of 12? We’d wager to bet you weren’t getting invited to Google I/O. On this episode, Corey chats with Alex Zenla, the founder and CTO of Edera. Only in her mid-20s, Alex already has more than a decade’s worth of professional experience working in the tech industry. They discuss how Alex found her way into programming at a young age, her experiences with open source projects like the Dart Project and Chromium OS, and getting contacted by Google’s lawyers as a preteen. You’ll also get to learn about Alex’s company, Edera, and their creative approaches to Kubernetes container security using Xen hypervisors.

Eventually, the Dart programming language came along, and Alex got deeply involved in the ecosystem, contributing to the language and standard library, and building core open source technologies. At the age of 14, she was hired by an IoT company called DGLogik to build an IoT platform that could scale across complex networks, launching my career in IoT. At DGLogik, Alex became deeply involved in Google's IoT technologies across multiple divisions, ultimately ending up working at Google on their IoT platform for their internal Real Estate.

        <![CDATA[<p>What were you doing at the age of 12? We’d wager to bet you weren’t getting invited to Google I/O. On this episode, Corey chats with Alex Zenla, the founder and CTO of Edera. Only in her mid-20s, Alex already has more than a decade’s worth of professional experience working in the tech industry. They discuss how Alex found her way into programming at a young age, her experiences with open source projects like the Dart Project and Chromium OS, and getting contacted by Google’s lawyers as a preteen. You’ll also get to learn about Alex’s company, Edera, and their creative approaches to Kubernetes container security using Xen hypervisors. Did we forget to mention that there are multiple sidebars about Minecraft in this one? So grab your pick axe, put on your headphones, and a Google legal will be at your door by the time we wrap up this conversation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Highlights</strong></p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(0:54) The Duckbill Group sponsor read</p><p>(1:28) What is Edera?</p><p>(2:18) Who is the target customer for Edera's product</p><p>(7:50) Breaking down the overhead makeup of Edera</p><p>(10:28) How Edera sidesteps the problems with container isolation</p><p>(13:20) Alex's history working with tech</p><p>(15:40) The Duckbill Group sponsor read</p><p>(16:23) How a phone call with a lawyer helped get Alex to Google I/O at the age of 12</p><p>(18:55) Starting Alex's proper tech career thanks to a Dart library</p><p>(21:24) The important role of Minecraft in Alex's life and career</p><p>(23:40) The value of good networking </p><p>(28:15) What it's been like for Alex to raise a Series A</p><p>(29:56) Where you can find more from Alex</p><p><br></p><p><br><strong>About Alex Zenla</strong></p><p>Alex Zenla is a technologist that has 10+ years experience in the full-time corporate world who is rebuilding the foundations of infrastructure to be secure-by-design.</p><p><br>Alex grew an interest in computers at the age of 7, learning about hypervisors and hardware technologies. At the age of 11, she was inspired by the concept of Chrome OS to get involved in low level systems, where she contributed to the Chromium and Chromium OS projects. This led to being invited to Google I/O 2012 by the Chrome OS team at just the age of 12. Eventually, the Dart programming language came along, and Alex got deeply involved in the ecosystem, contributing to the language and standard library, and building core open source technologies. At the age of 14, she was hired by an IoT company called DGLogik to build an IoT platform that could scale across complex networks, launching my career in IoT. At DGLogik, Alex became deeply involved in Google's IoT technologies across multiple divisions, ultimately ending up working at Google on their IoT platform for their internal Real Estate.

Beyond that, James explains the mindset required to give advice as an analyst, what attracted him to becoming an analyst in the first place, and why RedMonk focuses on the qualitative instead of the quantitative.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Highlights</strong></p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(0:29) The Wiz sponsor read</p><p>(1:31) What lead James to become an analyst and founding RedMonk</p><p>(4:36) Why James believes developers are the “ new monarchmakers”</p><p>(10:06) Recounting the time James credentialed Corey as an analyst on Twitter</p><p>(12:24) Who and what are analysts?</p><p>(17:44) The woes of rage-driven development</p><p>(21:01) The Wiz sponsor read</p><p>(21:55) Why Corey thinks James is a model Twitter user and advocate</p><p>(25:23) What makes RedMonk’s industry events stick out from everyone else</p><p>(35:15) Why James habitually changes his name on Twitter</p><p>(36:45) Where you can find more from James</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About James Governor</strong></p><p>James Governor founded RedMonk in 2002 with Stephen O'Grady.

        <![CDATA[<p>On this Screaming in the Cloud Replay, Corey is joined by accomplished tech journalist Daisuke Wakabayashi to explore the world of tech reporting.

        <![CDATA[<p>Eric Carter of Sysdig joins Corey to tackle the evolving landscape of cloud security, particularly in AWS environments. As attackers leverage automation to strike within minutes, Sysdig focuses on real-time threat detection and rapid response. Tools like Runtime Insights and open-source Falco help teams identify and mitigate misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and stealthy attacks, while Kubernetes aids in limiting lateral movement.

        <![CDATA[<p>Seth Eliot, Principal Resilience Architect at Arpio, and former Global Reliability Lead at AWS, joins Corey to discuss cloud resilience. He emphasizes that Multi-AZ setups are typically sufficient, with multi-region configurations only necessary for specific risks. Seth highlights the importance of balancing cost and resilience based on business needs, while cautioning against making resilience a mere checkbox exercise. Together, they explore disaster recovery challenges, noting that many companies fail to account for real-world complexities during testing. Seth also stresses the importance of avoiding control plane dependencies and warns that poorly designed multi-cloud setups can introduce additional risks.</p><p><strong>Show Highlights</strong></p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(1:12) Backblaze sponsor read</p><p>(1:40) Seth’s involvement in the Well-Architected sphere of AWS</p><p>(4:43) Well-Architected as a maturity model</p><p>(6:46) Cost vs. resilience</p><p>(10:37) The tension between resiliency and the cost pillar</p><p>(13:26) Legitimate reasons to go multi-region </p><p>(18:31) Mistakes people make when trying to avoid an AWS outage</p><p>(24:07) The challenges of control planes</p><p>(25:04) What people are getting wrong about the resiliency landscape in 2024</p><p>(26:31) Where you can find more from Seth</p><p><strong>About Seth Eliot</strong></p><p>Currently Principal Resilience Architect at Arpio, and ex-Amazon, ex-AWS, ex-Microsoft… Seth has spent years knee-deep in the tech trenches, figuring out how to design, implement, and launch software that's not just fast but also bulletproof. He thrives on helping teams tackle those "make or break" technical, process, or culture challenges—then partners up to solve them. As the Global Reliability Lead for AWS Well-Architected, Seth didn’t just work with customers; he scaled his insights via workshops, presentations, and blog posts, benefiting thousands. Before that, as one of the rare AWS-dedicated Principal Solutions Architects at Amazon.com (yep, not AWS, but the mothership itself), he rolled up his sleeves with engineers to fine-tune the AWS magic powering Amazon.com’s immense stack. Earlier? He led as Principal Engineer for Amazon Fresh and International Tech, and before that, helped bring Prime Video into homes everywhere.</p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><ul><li>Personal site: <a href="https://linktr.ee/setheliot">https://linktr.ee/setheliot</a></li><li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/setheliot/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/setheliot/</a></li><li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/setheliot">https://twitter.com/setheliot</a></li></ul><p><strong>Sponsor<br></strong>Backblaze: <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">https://www.backblaze.com/</a> </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>On this Screaming in the Cloud Replay, we’re revisiting our conversation with Stephanie Wong. When she first sat down with Corey, she was the Head of Developer Engagement at Google, but today, she serves as the company’s Head of Technical Storytelling.

Stephanie is not one to put her job title first. Her bio covers the spread from dancer, to hip-hop medalist, to podcast host. Stephanie gives us the birds eye view on her own non-traditional and interdisciplinary path that led to her work both in and outside of Google. Stephanie’s focus on producing content that reaches across a wide spectrum of participants is crucial to how she has broken the mold on what tech can do, and her lessons are ones we can all learn from.</p><p><br></p><p><br><strong>Show Highlights:</strong></p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(1:06) Backblaze sponsor read</p><p>(1:32) Explaining the Head of Developer Engagement</p><p>(2:13) Stephanie’s background and authenticity in tech</p><p>(7:11) Approaching developer relations from a non-”traditional” tech background</p><p>(11:04) Building a personal and company online presence</p><p>(14:41) Corey’s perceived contradictions with Google Cloud</p><p>(22:29) Through engaging your audience through media and storytelling</p><p>(27:23) Helping find the next generation of tech talent</p><p>(29:23) The cloud and the inflection of tech</p><p>(38:51) Where you can find more from Stephanie</p><p><strong>About Stephanie Wong:</strong></p><p>Stephanie Wong is an award-winning speaker, engineer, pageant queen, and hip hop medalist.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this Replay of Screaming in the Cloud, we revisit our inspiring conversation with Jackie Singh. At the time, she had recently served as a senior cybersecurity staffer at the Biden campaign. But her venerated career is considerably more than that alone.

Jackie goes into detail on her time spent at the Biden campaign and the intricacies of working in such highly politicized, and short term, environment. The cyber security threats she faced there were paramount, to downplay it, and have given Jackie a rich and constantly developing perspective on security.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this Screaming in the Cloud Replay, we revisit a spirited debated between Corey and the VP of Product and Industry Marketing at Google Cloud, Brian Hall.  The topic — How much time should one spend in a job? But thankfully, their conversation doesn’t limit itself to just that! Corey and Brian chat about how social media’s failure to capture nuance and context can lead to some unfortunate misinterpretations. Brian offers some insight on his significant amount of time spent at Microsoft under various roles. He gives his perspective on how one should optimize their career path for where they want to go, and not just follow the money.

At the time of recording, Chloe was a Senior Cloud Advocate for Microsoft, and today, she works for Google as a Senior Developer Relations Engineer. When we spoke to her, Chloe had recently started the Master Creep Theatre (yes, with the British spelling) which is a project to bring some more creative and artistic efforts into the tech world! Given Chloe’s non-traditional background she’s able to bring a lot of great perspective to weaving these two worlds together. Chloe also discusses the politics of navigating DMs as a woman on the internet, fun. Her and Corey discuss internet culture in general and how to make the most of it, in spite of all the baggage.

Her projects and work with Azure have ranged from fake boyfriend alerts to Mario Kart 'astrology', and have been featured in VICE, The New York Times, as well as SmashMouth's Twitter account. Chloe holds a BA in Drama from San Francisco State University and is a graduate of Hackbright Academy.

Scott tells us what exactly Docker is, and where it starts, which is the community around it.

Ivan is the webinar author at ipSpace.net where he is working on making networking an approachable subject for everyone.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Corey chats with Google's Nick Eberts about how Kubernetes helps manage applications across different cloud environments. They cover the benefits and challenges of using Kubernetes, especially in Google's cloud (GKE), and discuss its role in making applications more flexible and scalable. The conversation also touches on how Kubernetes supports a multi-cloud approach, simplifies the deployment process, and can potentially save costs while avoiding being tied down to one cloud provider.

        <![CDATA[<p>Andrew Shieh shares the thrilling story of SmugMug’s bold leap into AWS’s cloud technology, marking it as one of the pioneering companies to harness the cloud for digital photography storage. This episode offers a unique perspective into the type of strategy and groundbreaking tech advancements that catapulted SmugMug’s success. Listen to the full episode for a masterclass in innovation and adaptation!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show highlights: </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>(00:00) </strong>Corey introduces the show &amp; Guest Andrew Shieh</p><p><strong>(00:54)</strong>Andrew shares the story of how SmugMug became AWS's first enterprise customer. </p><p><strong>(02:17) </strong>Discussion on the evolution of AWS's customer service</p><p><strong>(04:31)</strong> Reflections on the expansion of AWS services. </p><p><strong>(06:08)</strong> The critical role of Amazon S3 in SmugMug's operations</p><p><strong>(12:24)</strong> AWS's interest in unique customer stories and feedback </p><p><strong>(09:32) </strong>SmugMug's cloud strategy and optimization</p><p><strong>(13:50)</strong> Andrew discusses challenges and solutions in cloud adoption</p><p><strong>(17:38) </strong>Andrew shares his experiences at AWS re:Invent, offering thoughts on the conference's evolution</p><p><strong>(21:09)</strong> A look into AWS's pricing formulas and business insights </p><p><strong>(31:55) </strong>Closing thoughts</p><p><b>About Andrew</b></p><p>Andrew "shandrew" Shieh is a multidisciplinary engineer, focused today on making the AWS cloud do what it promises to. Andrew started as an environmental engineer, focused on energy efficiency and air pollution modeling, but quickly got dragged into tech after spending most of college at the help desk of the Unix computer cluster.</p><p>Andrew's current interests include sustainability, cost efficiency, and economics.

        <![CDATA[<p>Chen Gour Arie, Director of Engineering at Snyk, joins Corey on Screaming in the Cloud to discuss how his company, Enso Security, got acquired by Snyk and what drew him to Snyk’s mission as a partner. Chen expands on the challenges currently facing the security space, and shares what he feels are likely outcomes for challenges like improving compliance across value-add on security tools and the increasing scope of cybersecurity at such a relatively early phase of the industry’s development. Corey and Chen also discuss what makes Snyk so appealing to developers and why that was an important part of their growth strategy, as well as Chen’s take on recent security incidents that have hit the news. </p><p><b>About Chen</b></p><p>Chen is the Co-founder of Enso Security (part of Snyk) - the world's 1st ASPM platform.

This is <em>Screaming in the Cloud</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: Welcome to <em>Screaming in the Cloud</em>. I’m Corey Quinn. This promoted guest episode is brought to us by our friends at<a href="https://snyk.io"> Snyk</a>, and as a part of that they have given me someone rather distinct as far as career paths and trajectories go. Chen Gour Arie is currently a director of engineering over at Snyk, but in a previous life—read as about six months or so ago—he was a co-founder of Enso Security, which got acquired. Chen, thank you for joining me.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Chen: Thank you for having me, Corey.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: So, I guess an interesting place to begin is, what has the past couple of years been like? And let’s dive in with, what is or was Enso Security?</p><p><br></p><p><br>Chen: Yeah. So, Enso started for me first as friendship because I joined the team that I was working with as a contractor for a while. There was such an excellent and interesting team with a very interesting environment. And then after a while, they asked me to join that team, and then I became part of the security team of a company called Wix.com.</p><p><br></p><p><br>It’s quite a large company, web do-it-yourself kind of platform, that you can build your own website with a presentation style kind of interface, and our job was to secure that. And we formed a very, very nice friendship throughout it, but we also gained a lot of experience because you work with such a large company, and you experience many challenges, including real-time attempts to penetrate, and the complexity of social engineering at large scale. You go through a lot of things. So, this was the start. And after a couple of years, we decided that we have some interesting ideas that can do good to the community in the cybersecurity industry, and we embarked on a new journey together to start Enso.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: I can see why you aligned with Snyk. It sounds like a lot of what you were aimed at is very much in step with how they tend to approach things. I have a number of sponsors that I can say this about, but Snyk is a particularly fun one, in that, obviously, you folks pay me to run advertisements and featured guest episodes like this, which is appreciated, but we also pay you as a customer of Snyk because it does a lot of things that we find both incredibly useful and incredibly valuable. The thread that I’ve seen running through everything coming out of Snyk has been this concept of, I think, what some folks would say shifting left, but it comes down to the idea of flagging issues as early in the process as possible rather than trying to get someone to remember what they did three months ago, and oh, yeah, go back and address that. That alone has made it one of the best approaches to things that are truly important—and yes, I consider security to be one of those things—that I’ve seen in a while on the dev tool space.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Chen: Yeah, and this has been the mission of Snyk for a very long time. And when we started Enso, our mission was to help in some additional elements of the same problem space in introducing additional tools to help drive this shift left, this democratization of the security effort around and in the organization, and resolving some of the friction that is created with the, kind of, confusing ownership of security and software development. So, this was kind of the mission of Enso. The category introduced by it and the ASPM category to bring the notion of postural security, postural management to applications. And it really is a huge fit with the journey of Snyk, and we were very excited to be approached by them to join their journey and help them do further shift left and extend on problem space on the complexity of this collaboration between security and developers.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: A question I have around this is that it seems to me that viewing security posture management from an application perspective, and then viewing other parts of it from a cloud provider perspective and other parts of it from a variety of different things—you know, go to RSA and walk up and down the endless rows of booths, and you know, look at the 12 different things that they’re all selling because it’s all the same stuff around 12 categories or so, with different companies and logos and the rest—it feels like, on some level, that can lead very quickly to a fractured security posture where, well this is the app side of the security, and then we have the infrastructure security folks, but those groups don’t really collaborate because they’re separate and distinct. How do you square that circle?</p><p><br></p><p><br>Chen: Yeah, it’s not an easy problem, and I think that the North Star of many vendors exists this notion of sometimes I think we call it CNAP or something that will unify all of it. Cloud as a solution, and the offering that exists with cloud computing enables a lot of it, enables a lot of this unification, but we have to remember that the industry is young. The software security industry in general is young. If we will look at any other industry with that size, all of them have much more history and time to mature. And inside this industry, the security itself is even younger.</p><p><br></p><p><br>It has become a real problem much later than then when software started. It has become a huge problem when cloud emerged and became, like, the huge deal that it is now. And when more and more businesses are based on digital services, and more people are writing software, a lot of it is young, and it needs time to mature, and it’s time to get to—to accomplish some big parts like this unification that you are pointing out missing.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: I have to confess my own bias here. A lot of the stuff that I build is very small-scale, leverages serverless technologies heavily, and even when I’m dealing with things like the CDK, where I start to have my application and the infrastructure that powers it coalesce into the same sort of thing, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible for some of these config...</p>]]>

And after a couple of years, we decided that we have some interesting ideas that can do good to the community in the cybersecurity industry, and we embarked on a new journey together to start Enso.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: I can see why you aligned with Snyk. It sounds like a lot of what you were aimed at is very much in step with how they tend to approach things. I have a number of sponsors that I can say this about, but Snyk is a particularly fun one, in that, obviously, you folks pay me to run advertisements and featured guest episodes like this, which is appreciated, but we also pay you as a customer of Snyk because it does a lot of things that we find both incredibly useful and incredibly valuable. The thread that I’ve seen running through everything coming out of Snyk has been this concept of, I think, what some folks would say shifting left, but it comes down to the idea of flagging issues as early in the process as possible rather than trying to get someone to remember what they did three months ago, and oh, yeah, go back and address that. That alone has made it one of the best approaches to things that are truly important—and yes, I consider security to be one of those things—that I’ve seen in a while on the dev tool space.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Chen: Yeah, and this has been the mission of Snyk for a very long time. And when we started Enso, our mission was to help in some additional elements of the same problem space in introducing additional tools to help drive this shift left, this democratization of the security effort around and in the organization, and resolving some of the friction that is created with the, kind of, confusing ownership of security and software development. So, this was kind of the mission of Enso. The category introduced by it and the ASPM category to bring the notion of postural security, postural management to applications. And it really is a huge fit with the journey of Snyk, and we were very excited to be approached by them to join their journey and help them do further shift left and extend on problem space on the complexity of this collaboration between security and developers.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: A question I have around this is that it seems to me that viewing security posture management from an application perspective, and then viewing other parts of it from a cloud provider perspective and other parts of it from a variety of different things—you know, go to RSA and walk up and down the endless rows of booths, and you know, look at the 12 different things that they’re all selling because it’s all the same stuff around 12 categories or so, with different companies and logos and the rest—it feels like, on some level, that can lead very quickly to a fractured security posture where, well this is the app side of the security, and then we have the infrastructure security folks, but those groups don’t really collaborate because they’re separate and distinct. How do you square that circle?</p><p><br></p><p><br>Chen: Yeah, it’s not an easy problem, and I think that the North Star of many vendors exists this notion of sometimes I think we call it CNAP or something that will unify all of it. Cloud as a solution, and the offering that exists with cloud computing enables a lot of it, enables a lot of this unification, but we have to remember that the industry is young. The software security industry in general is young. If we will look at any other industry with that size, all of them have much more history and time to mature. And inside this industry, the security itself is even younger.</p><p><br></p><p><br>It has become a real problem much later than then when software started. It has become a huge problem when cloud emerged and became, like, the huge deal that it is now. And when more and more businesses are based on digital services, and more people are writing software, a lot of it is young, and it needs time to mature, and it’s time to get to—to accomplish some big parts like this unification that you are pointing out missing.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: I have to confess my own bias here. A lot of the stuff that I build is very small-scale, leverages serverless technologies heavily, and even when I’m dealing with things like the CDK, where I start to have my application and the infrastructure that powers it coalesce into the same sort of thing, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible for some of these config...</p>]]>

She has contributed to several books on SRE, such as the Site Reliability Engineering book, Seeking SRE, and 97 Things Every SRE Should Know.

Laura also serves as a member of the USENIX Association board of directors.

        <![CDATA[<p>Martin Mao, CEO &amp; Cofounder at Chronosphere, joins Corey on Screaming in the Cloud to discuss the trends he sees in the observability industry. Martin explains why he feels measuring observability costs isn’t nearly as important as understanding the velocity of observability costs increasing, and why he feels efficiency is something that has to be built into processes as companies scale new functionality. Corey and Martin also explore how observability can now be used by business executives to provide top line visibility and value, as opposed to just seeing observability as a necessary cost. <br></p><p><b>About Martin</b></p><p>Martin is a technologist with a history of solving problems at the largest scale in the world and is passionate about helping enterprises use cloud native observability and open source technologies to succeed on their cloud native journey.

        <![CDATA[<p>Jonathan (Koz) Kozolchyk, General Manager for Certificate Services at AWS, joins Corey on Screaming in the Cloud to discuss the best practices he recommends around certificates.

        <![CDATA[<p>Kannan Solaiappan, Head of Reliability and Data Engineering at Circles Life, joins Corey on Screaming in the Cloud to discuss building a team in a start-up environment and the complexities of balancing reliability and security with scale. Kannan describes the challenges of building a semi-platform multiple instances model and how products like Severalnines have helped identify and optimize potential problems before they affect customers.

Before that, he co-founded Copious, a social marketplace built around people and their interests, and Yoohoot, a mobile advertising company that was acquired by Appconomy. Join Corey and Rob as they discuss the ins and outs of continuous integration and continuous delivery and touch upon why it’s hard to scale CI/CD, why many companies end up focusing on what’s called undifferentiated heavy lifting and why that’s a bad thing, what keeps AWS awake at night (hint: something to do with money), why at the end of the day, it’s all about the product, how developer relations is really a marketing endeavor, how CircleCI is a team of engineers solving problems for another team of engineers, why distributed teams are becoming the norm, and more.

      <itunes:summary>Richard Hartmann, Director of Community at Grafana Labs, joins Corey to discuss the evolution of cloud services and the infrastructure behind them. Whether it’s how monitoring became observability, or how predicting server breakdowns at scale has become more of a science than simply grunting and pointing, Richard provides a balanced perspective on what users actually want and why they want it. Richard also reveals how pricing impacts community-building efforts, creating psychological safety for your users to promote long-term adoption, and why not optimizing your data makes about as much sense as storing 10,000 copies of Lord of the Rings in your living room. </itunes:summary>

Corey and Michael discuss the perception of cryptomining in your cloud instance being seen as more of a nuisance than the expensive threat it is, as well as other threats out there today and how they gauge the severity of a threat against more than just monetary cost. Michael also reveals how the team was put together to compile the report and why they intentionally moved away from packaging it as a thinly-veiled marketing tool and towards creating a report of substantive value. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today Corey is joined by returning guest Steren Giannini, Group Product Manager, Google Cloud. Steren is back to discuss his Google Cloud 20% project: Google Cloud Carbon Footprint, an initiative that is now available for all Google Cloud customers to help them understand and reduce their carbon emissions. Corey and Steren discuss individual versus corporate environmental responsibility, and Steren talks about how Google Cloud’s net operational emissions are zero because of renewable matching. He goes on to talk about Google Cloud’s goal to be net zero in 2030.

Steren shares that picking the cleanest regions is one of the simplest actions a customer can take to reduce their gross carbon emissions. They discuss the tool Google Cloud Region picker, which allows customers to identify their priorities with carbon footprint, price, and latency, and then choose the ideal region for their needs. Steren and Corey discuss at what point of scale carbon usage begins to make a significant difference, and they conclude by talking about the relationship between economics and efforts to reduce carbon emissions.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Corey chats with Anton Chuvakin, Security Strategy Something at Google Cloud. Anton begins by talking about his journey to a technical role at Google prefaced by a position at Gartner, and a job as head of security for a start-up that was acquired by Google. Corey asks Anton for his opinion on the role and positioning of security vendors, and Anton talks about the challenge of deciding when to tell clients they’re on the wrong path and when to help them tread their own path with the least pain. Corey and Anton talk about the hotly debated definition of what XDR actually is, and then move into a discussion about whether or not cloud vendors should view security as a profit center and how cost should be factored into cloud security. Anton shares about his own podcast, “Cloud Security Podcast” and the narratives he’s found interesting lately. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today Corey talks with Anadelia Fadeev, the Senior Director of Demand Generation at Teleport. Anadelia starts by talking about the three core areas of a marketing team: product, content, and demand generation. Corey and Anadelia discuss the “inbound” and “outbound” aspects of marketing - what is bringing people to you, and what you’re doing to add value and build trust. Anadelia talks about how, in her career, she has ended up specializing in a particular audience versus a specific product. 
Corey and Anadelia commiserate on marketing woes and talk about the non-linear journey of the consumer, then discuss how building trust is paramount, even when there aren’t measurable results. They finish up by speculating on the fine line of knowing when to build gates into the marketing process, and “thinking about thinking” - understanding how customers think and where they’re going to look to find solutions to their problems. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today Corey interviews Jeff Smith, Director of Production Operations at Basis Technologies. In a post-2020 world, they discuss the pros and cons of remote work. Jeff talks about the trade-off that gets made when employers allow workers to forfeit face to face time in favor of working from home. Jeff and Corey make the point that often the interactions that are cited as pros — i.e., chatting with a coworker in the hallway — are the very same exchanges employees identify as interruptions to their actual work. They come to the conclusion that the loss of face to face interaction is often still worth the benefits to employees and companies. Corey and Jeff conclude their conversation by talking about what Jeff has learned about the power of telling your story and using your voice since the release of his book, “Operations Anti-Patterns.” </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today Corey chats with promoted guest, CTO for cloud at EDB, Benjamin Anderson. They start by talking about the evolution of the market space for cloud-hosted database services and relational database trends over the years. Corey and Benjamin discuss different philosophies of open source and talk about EDB’s different cloud offerings, including primarily BigAnimal as well as EDB’s newer open source project “Cloud Native PG.” Benjamin explains how EDB approaches maintenance windows and answers Corey’s question about what kinds of workloads are not best suited for BigAnimal. They discuss different database systems and Benjamin talks about working with various systems over the years and why he recommends Postgres. 
EDB has recently received an investment from private equity, so Benjamin talks about how he feels that will affect the future of the company. Corey and Benjamin conclude with a discussion of the crowded cloud-hosted database market space and how a smaller company can have more specific focus and offer the customer more value for their managed service. </itunes:summary>

A lot of us didn’t go through that path. We wound up finding our own ways to tech. My guest today has one of the more remarkable stories that I’ve come across. Carla Stickler is a software engineer at <a href="https://www.g2.com/">G2</a>. Carla, thank you for agreeing to suffer my slings and arrows today. It’s appreciated.</p><p>Carla: Thanks so much for having me, Corey.</p><p>Corey: So, before you entered tech—I believe this is your first job as an engineer and as of the time we’re recording this, it’s been just shy of a year that you’ve done in the role. What were you doing before now?</p><p>Carla: Oh, boy, Corey. What was I doing? I definitely was not doing software engineering. I was a Broadway actress. So, I spent about 15 years in New York doing musical theater, touring around the country and Asia in big Broadway shows. And that was pretty much all I did.</p><p>I guess, I also was a teacher. I was a voice teacher and I taught voice lessons, and I had a studio and I taught it a couple of faculties in New York. But I was one hundred percent ride-or-die, like, all the way to the end musical theater or bust, from a very, very early age. So, it’s been kind of a crazy time changing careers. [laugh].</p><p>Corey: What inspired that? I mean, it doesn’t seem like it’s a common pattern of someone who had an established career as a Broadway actress to wake up one day and say, “You know what I don’t like anymore. That’s right being on stage, doing the thing that I spent 15 years doing. You know what I want to do instead? That’s right, be mad at computers all the time and angry because some of the stuff is freaking maddening.” What was the catalyst that—</p><p><br></p><p><br>Carla: Yeah, sounds crazy. [laugh].</p><p><br></p><p><br>Corey: —inspired you to move?</p><p><br></p><p><br>Carla: It sounds crazy. It was kind of a long time coming. I love performing; I do, and it’s like, my heart and soul is with performing. Nothing else in my life really can kind of replace that feeling I get when I’m on stage. But the one thing they don’t really talk about when you are growing up and dreaming of being a performer is how physically and emotionally taxing it is.</p><p><br></p><p><br>I think there’s, like, this narrative around, like, “Being an actor is really hard, and you should only do it if you can’t see yourself doing anything else,” but they don’t actually ever explain to you what hard means. You know, you expect that, oh, there’s going to be a lot of other people doing it in, I’m going to be auditioning all the time, and I’m going to have a lot of competition, but you never quite grasp the physical and emotional toll that it takes on your body and your—you know, just ongoing in auditions and getting rejections all the time. And then when you’re working in a show eight times a week and you’re wearing four-inch heels on a stage that is on a giant angle, and you’re wearing wigs that are, like, really, really massive, you don’t really—no one ever tells you how hard that is on your body. So, for me, I just hit a point where I was performing nonstop and I was so tired. I was, like, living at my physical therapist’s office, I was living at, like, my head therapist’s office.</p><p>I was just trying to, like, figure out why I was so miserable. And so, I actually left in 2015, performing full time.

Carla talks about her 15 year career on Broadway in shows ranging from “Mamma Mia!” to “The Sound of Music.” She expounds on her decision to leave the world of Broadway, and some of the physical and emotional taxes it takes that reinforced her choice to leave. She wanted to take on a new challenge, and did she ever pick one! Carla discusses her switch and the many obstacles she had to surmount in such a sudden shift, but also the incredible growth that she undertook in her transition to tech.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Once upon a time Docker came out and changed the industry forever, but in the before times we had to manage computer systems ourselves! Now things have changed, and one of the biggest voices in that change is Michael DeHaan, creator of Cobbler and Ansible. The current and coming generation of work in tech is to stand on the backs of many giants, of which Michael is one.

Michael reflects on the bad old days when server was king, and how Cobbler revolutionized how the provisioning of bare metal systems worked. As Michael tells it, it was basically a way to “glue” everything together. But, of course, it is more complicated than that. Michael didn’t stop there, soon afterward he created Ansible. Ansible was a way to help alleviate some of the stickiness of config management, and deal with scale. If you want to learn more about them both, tune in for that and Michael’s many other offerings!

      <itunes:summary>Corey often has cloud security issues forced up on him, but he isn’t necessarily in the trenches. Today’s guest Yoav Alon, CTO at Orca Security, has been doing the security grunt work for quite some time. Yoav and Orca are now at the forefront of cloud security and his encompassing perspectives go far to cover the cloud security spread.

Yoav talks about Orca’s three principles of security that help alleviate “friction” i.e. in-fighting with your peers. He also reflects on some of their security research in AWS and how in one particular discovery they leapt to the front of the pack. Yoav talks about how “data is king” and the security needs it demands, he reflects on AWS’s quick reaction to security problems, offers some takes on Azure, and more!</itunes:summary>

One of the interesting things about RedMonk is the many directions they go in seemingly all at once, and Kate joining the team is adding a path.

Kate talks about her academic background and her PhD and her post-doc work. She is also a recently published author. So, why did she make the jump to frontend engineering? Kate offers some solid reasons behind her transition after developing an interest in the digital humanities. Kate provides some excellent insight on balancing these seemingly separate spheres of work that, in actuality, can overlap.</itunes:summary>

In the wishy washy week to week changing in what companies constitutionally are, Couchbase is sticking with their original intent. 

Chris discusses the spawning of the database industry, and the many types of databases that are out there. He discusses how Couchbase took a step back and asked, why is everything rooted in the noSQL or SQL conversation? Why not just build a database. Chris’s focus on a particular problem across his career has led to one steeped in database knowledge. The end result is an insightful and wide ranging take on the database needs of the technology world.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Casey Lee is the CTO at Gaggle, which actually is saving lives. While loads of companies make the claim, in this case it rings rather true. Gaggle sells software to school districts that use the software to help protect their students by looking for indicators of bullying, self-harm, and a litany of other challenges facing young people in today’s world.

Casey expands on the 6 million and growing students that they and their software is working to protect. Corey and Casey also share about their serendipitous encounter at re:Invent. Form helping Gaggle save on their AWS bills, they then dive into Casey’s area of expertise: containers. And at the end of all, they land on “quinntainers” and the 18th way to run containers on AWS.</itunes:summary>

Now having taken a corporate gig, at the news of which Corey was a little let down, Scott is able to quell his concerns. Scott is still as public and prolific as ever. 

Scott holds true to his security research, and as he tells it his public presence is something companies can learn to value instead of sweat. Corey frequently mines Scott’s Twitter for his weekly security newsletter, an excellent source for the latest in security. Scott offers kind works on the newsletter, IMSDv2, and some request for areas for AWS to improve their security game!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>For a while Corey has resisted the “siren’s song” to do an episode on web3. Well, the time has finally come to change that. Today’s guest, software engineer Molly White, runs a collection of interesting stories at web3isgoinggreat.com, where she demonstrates a flair for making web 3 somewhat approachable, and levels her own just critiques. 

Molly discusses the “handwaviness” of web3 as “the future of the web” and how the hype might be overselling. She and Corey talk about the sometimes warranted hesitancies about certain technologies, and how web3 falls into some of those. She shoots down some of the misinformation about crypto and the odd ball stuff popping up around it, and lets us in on some of her own criticisms. Which are finely hewn and actually make sense! Unlike the dark morass of crypto itself. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Today’s guest is the source of what Corey considers some of the most “horrifying feedback” he has ever gotten from his audience. Namely, that one of his Twitter threads was the catalyst for the change in the course of a career. But, thankfully it was for the better, and Johnny Podhradsky, Technical Program Manager for Offboard Infrastructure at Waymo, is here to tell us why.

Johnny talks about being a TPM, what exactly it is, and all that at a self-driving car company. Johnny takes a crack at working in a space where the outcome isn’t always tangible and at hand, and how he interprets that as an “anti-entropy agent”. Johnny reflects on Corey’s well timed Twitter thread that caused a major career shift. Johnny’s refreshing perspectives on program management, combating entropy, structuring your life and work, and more are wise beyond his years!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Corey has admired today’s guest, a “study in contrast,” for a quite a while. Now, Joe Onisick, a Principal at Transformation CONTINUUM, joins the “Screaming” line up. Joe’s consultancy focus is on helping companies achieve digital transformation, which is a progressively forward looking space. The contrast in said study is that Joe chose to leave Silicon Valley and “go live in the woods,” which is certainly an uncommon combination.

Corey and Joe discuss their connection over Joe’s pinned Tweet, in which he states a transformational shift in his own life towards living better. For starters Joe decided to climb Kilimanjaro, leave Silicon Valley, and start his consultancy. He rakes over the nuances of establishing a consultancy in digital transformation, and what exactly that means. Joe’s emphasis on being straight forward and honest with his customers lends a credibility to his work that, sadly, seems rare these days. But with that honesty at hand he dives into multi-cloud, migration, and more!</itunes:summary>
      <itunes:subtitle>Corey has admired today’s guest, a “study in contrast,” for a quite a while. Now, Joe Onisick, a Principal at Transformation CONTINUUM, joins the “Screaming” line up. Joe’s consultancy focus is on helping companies achieve digital transformation, which is</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:summary>Today’s guest works in a world that Corey “got the hell out of” after a brief tenure when he realized he just wasn’t very good at it. That’s why The Duckbill Group hired on Ashleigh Early as their Head of Sales. Ashleigh joined the team about six months ago and since then has only assuaged Corey’s and Co.’s sales needs.

Ashleigh breaks down the nuance in enterprise sale, and shares some secret on how does one actually make money in the space. She shares some pet peeves with some of the sales culture, and she addresses some much needed changes within sales culture at large. This includes the need to connect with people, do your research going in, the role of databases, and more! If you want some insight check in on Ashleigh’s take!</itunes:summary>

Two subjects that are close to Corey’s heart, and on which Tim’s opinion are fairly countercultural. 

Tim expands on his blog post, which in short states that multi-cloud is not as complicated anymore. His take, it is now a “reasonable” thing for companies to ponder. For Tim it isn’t realistic for larger companies, especially, to not be multi-cloud. Tim and Corey go into the ins and outs of multi-cloud, tackling the people side of multi-cloud, and more!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Networking in AWS has gotten more and more capable over the years, but with it comes considerable complexity. Phillip Griffiths, Head of Business Development at NetFoundry, where they are trying to take a differentiated approach to the complexity of networking and AWS, has a thing or two to say about it.

Phillip and Corey tackle one of the most important things in the network stack: security. In that regard, as a network overlay NetFoundry has to start at the application level. Phillip dissects his “tiers” for zero trust and how he quantifies what zero trust actually is. With some help from a boy wizard and a conversation with his daughter, Phillip is able to reveal the magic behind the zero trust hat trick. Check out this in-depth conversation for more!</itunes:summary>

Nipun describes in detail some of Oracle’s more recent innovations, including MySQL HeatWave. Which if you’ll allow a terrible descriptor is MySQL with some “magic layered on top of it.” Nipun, however, is able to tell us exactly what the magic is and how it works. Nipun dives into the details as he and Corey discuss MySQL and HeatWave when it comes to processing, analytics, machine learning, moving data around and costs, its competition with other databases, the value it brings to customers, and much more!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>A year or so before the pandemic hit Corey traveled to Australia for a keynote speech. There he crossed paths with the closing keynote which was delivered by Rick Houlihan. Rick, Director Developer Relations for Strategic Accounts at MongoDB, put Corey’s brain through the squeeze over the course of his keynote—and now he is here to expand on how!

Rick started at DynamoDB, but made the jump back to MongoDB, and he does so from a position of authenticity and interest. Rick and Corey take a deep and multifaceted dive into the world of all things DB. Rick eases into an honest conversation on where MongoDB is at, his reasons for joining their organization, and the exciting places they are headed.</itunes:summary>

Back in the early days Rachel was at CloudHealth, the “800lbs gorilla” in that space, who in turn was acquired by VMware, and now Rachel is at Chronosphere. Rachel studied art history and computer science in school, so she was already off to a diverse start. Her first job was at Forrester which blew open the cloud doors for Rachel. From the earliest whiffing of AWS, to NetApp by way of Riverbed, and so much more Rachel has a lot to offer!</itunes:summary>

Instead it is a juicy new product announcement. And in the adroit words of Clint, product announcements “actually matter” to Corey’s audience. 

Clint starts off with a light refresher of what exactly Cribl, an observability company on the fundamental level, does. Recently Cribl has made dovetailing observability and security a priority. With their announcement of their product Cribl Edge, for which they did buy a couple of vowels-–they are “taking our existing best-in-class management technology, and we’re turning it into an agent.” Tune into Clint’s conversation for an extensive look at Cribl Edge, Clint’s perspectives, and more!</itunes:summary>

Well he writes fantastic third party tooling and blog posts and “turns them into the most glorious, intricate, and technical shit posts” that Corey has ever seen. 

Aidan talks about his inspiration from Asimov’s The Foundation for his ipv6-ghost-ship. Aidan and Corey vent a little about AWS’s “perfect track record” for security, and how they both have learned to question if that is actually the case. Aidan has been working (or at least getting paid to work) in AWS from its inception, and he reflects on how he has masterfully navigated, or perhaps teleported around, that space for years.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>There are good parts to TikTok, despite the crippling nature of existential pondering on ones age that it may induce. One of those good parts is that Corey gets to talk to people who, generally, he wouldn’t have access to across the cloud ecosystem. Today’s guest, Brooke Jamieson, Head of Enablement of AI/ML and Data at Blackbook.ai is a fortunate example of the great good that comes out of it.

Brooke has a knack for folding multiple things together into succinct content. Brooke takes the incredibly complex, and makes them easily accessible, via short form video. One of Brooke’s unique abilities is to create content that sells ideas over products. The result, a prolific and wide reception of some well honed perspectives. Check out the conversation for Brooke’s wisdom!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>In house pronunciation habits are a slight annoyance of the industry, so for now when it comes to CNCF, we will stick with spelling it out one letter at a time. We are glad to say that Liz Rice, Chief Open Source Officer at Isovalent, and chair of CNCF's Technical Oversight Committee, does the same. Gracefully so, ditto to Isovalent’s eBPF, instead of “Ehbehpf” which is at the start of today’s conversation.

Liz Rice spills the beans on eBPF, or extended Berkeley Packet Filter, which on its own basically means nothing. But, what it actually does is allow you to do is to run custom programs inside the kernel. Liz breaks down the varied ways that eBPF is useful, the story on how the enterprise versions of Cilium are useful, and some of the other tools Isovalent is bringing forward. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>For today’s episode we’re going to go off the beaten path a bit. We’re joined by Emily Kager, a Senior Android Engineer at Uber, to talk about the seemingly endless ways into tech. Emily found her way to mobile, a space that Corey self admittedly knows little about. Thankfully through content creators like Emily, he is becoming as erudite as the next. Emily’s diverse background and self determination serve as excellent example of how to carve you way into tech, how to do so successfully, and then sharing that with others.

Emily discusses her motivations for building out her TikTok as as space to shine the light on the endless ways into tech. Emily and Corey chat about Emily’s own unique way into the field. Emily was adrift for a short period of time after school, where she realized she felt “lukewarm” about a path in medicine. So, she leveled some wisdom and ended up exploring other options. Now she has a masters and is an active member of the tech community!</itunes:summary>

Anna Belak, Sysdig’s Director of Thought Leadership, is here to expand on all that “interesting” may entail. 

Anna, who holds a PhD in Materials Engineering, is now the high chancellor of the lords of thought for Sysidig. What this actually means is she works in product and marketing in a way that is “half evangelism and half product strategy.” Anna discusses Sysdig’s product evolution into DevSecOps, security in the container world, the 2022 Cloud-Native Security and Usage Report, and more! </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Lynn Langit, CEO of Lynn Langit Consulting, was one of the very first guest on “Screaming,” and now she is back, three hundred plus episodes later! Lynn’s repertoire is an impressive one. She was the first person to achieve AWS Community Hero as well as the equivalent designations at all three of the primary tier-one hyperscale cloud providers. Now as a consultant she is working across the cloud with an intensive focus on bioinformatics, quantum computing, and more.

Since the last time Lynn came on the conversation has shifted from “should we be using cloud” to “how should we use it?” Lynn’s research is primarily focused in bioinformatics, and most of that research is centered on cancer. So, “how should we use it” is at the forefront of her work. Since the COVID pandemic Lynn has had a front row to seat to the massive impact it has made on bioinformatics at large. She discusses the changes in the field, the dynamic ways that research and money interact, her rising interest in quantum computing, and how it has shaped her consultancy. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Companies come in many stripes these days, and everybody seems to be a unicorn. But for TheZebra and Sean Corbett, their Senior Software Engineer, this may just be the case. Over the past several years, they have “helped create software and proprietary platforms” that assist teams in their understanding of their own work as an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test.) 

Sean and Corey rake over how QA departments are waning in relevance, and their replacement by SDETs. Sean clarifies what exactly an SDET is, its history, and how it has changed over the past few years. Sean reflects on TheZebra and their emphasis on a more collaborative environment that brings engineers and testing into the other teams in an organization.</itunes:summary>

Rather, Jason is the Software Engineering Manager at Ekata, who is striving to be a global leader in online identity verification. Because, as it turns out, we live in the age where anybody can put anything anywhere all over the web!

Jason goes into details on Ekata, a Redis customer, and their efforts to reduce fraudulent activity online. He discusses their efforts to make things frictionless for the customer and the balance they need to strike. He also lays out why Ekata has chosen to use Redis in detail. Jason also notes the importance of striking a balance between the consumers willingness for privacy, versus convenience and patience.</itunes:summary>

First impressions were not great, but when Wayne Duso, VP of Storage, Edge and Data Governance Services at AWS, reached out with a genuine desire to hear Corey’s two cents—it left an impression.

Wayne reflects on Corey’s feedback on EFS in the early days, and how for technologists, input is “one of the most valuable things we can get.” Wayne reflects on the lessons he has learned across the history of EFS, as well as the other earlier services of AWS. Those other services stand as examples and bastions for Wayne to learn from. Wayne's comprehensive view of AWS provides some excellent connective tissue across such a massive entity. Tune in for the conversation!</itunes:summary>

Namely, they wanted to bring the messaging of Redis under one umbrella. 

Yiftach talks about the rise of Redis from the early days of being primarily a cache to its current state. Yiftach discusses the issues around latency and how Redis is working to shave the milliseconds. He also hashes out some of the nuance of working with both cloud environments and with the cloud vendors. Redis is a partner with AWS, which Yiftach expounds on the services they are providing in the cloud.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>It turns out that when it comes to incidents, you can do more than just blowing past them and onto the next one! Laura Maguire, lead of the research program at Jeli.io, is changing the “leave it in your tracks mentality” and focusing on the post-incident investigative work. Laura, who holds a PhD with a research focus Cognitive Systems Engineering, uses her doctoral work that focuses on DevOps teams responsible for critical digital services. Her work brings a suite of insights into how organizations can better function in the post-incident fallout.

Laura discusses her history working in high risk, high consequence environments–notbaly extreme mountain sports! She translates those perspectives to help her work with software engineers. Laura translates the potentially life threatening risks of work in alpine and mountain sports into studying the societal risks of DevOps and incidents. She offers up some wisdom on how organizations can better handle incidents. She also discusses Jel.io’s post-incident guide, and their efforts to guide how post-incident investigations can, and should, be carried out.</itunes:summary>

That is certainly the case for AB Periasamy, CEO and Co-Founder of MinIO, an open source provider of high performance, object storage software. 

AB and Corey talk about the shift from legacy to the cloud and the advent of S3, and how in that transition AB saw an opportunity. That was when he started to build a brand around the new demands for storage. AB saw that building a software storage company early on that was compatible with S3 would “sweep the market” and now they’re sitting on a billion dollar company.

      <itunes:summary>“Nobody cares about backups” might ring true in certain circles, and Corey has uttered that line a few times, but there are some who do. Nancy Wang, GM of AWS Backup and AWS Cryo at AWS, does care. A lot. And naturally she had to come on the show and tell Corey about it!

Nancy and Corey bat around some back up reasoning. Nancy kindly goes into the nuances of her own work, of which her title actually indicates what she does, and the importance that she sees in back ups. Nancy’s work doesn’t end there—she is also the founder and CEO of Advancing Women in Tech. A 501c non-profit, “Advancing Women” is an education platform designed to help women move into higher positions in their organizations. Check out the conversation for more!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Often on “Screaming” we get folks whose careers in tech don’t follow the typical path. This is certainly the case for Rachel Kelly, Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Fastly, who has pulled a kind of “Benjamin Buttoning” move, and has done a career repatriation. Rachel has gone from managing just the SaaS web app to managing vast groups of servers and data centers worldwide.

Rachel talks about her repatriation and gives the why, what, where, and how of her current position. Rachel wanted to tap into some of the more arcane aspects of how the internet works, and at Fastly she gets to be a part of that group. Rachel and Corey bat some AWS considerations across the net and have an enlightening conversation about the multitudes of AWS. From AWS offerings, to nuances of hiring, to some practices that need to be left in the rear view—Rachel and Corey cover the spread!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>A continual focus here on “Screaming” is to take time to sing the praises of those folks who aptly deserve them, and that we admire. Oftentimes Corey finds them out in the wilds known as conferences, and then in reflection will have them come on for a proper conversation. This is where Deirdré Straughan, Director of Open Source Community and Engagement at Intel, comes to play. 

Deirdré has had a storied career in tech that has spanned a few decades now, which in turn has put her into the position to understand the industry to a depth few do. With an extensive background in marketing, but not letting previous definitions limit her, Deirdré’s focus is now on extending “marketing” past its previous ploys. Deirdré expands on what exactly marketing as education means, and she also describes her highly varied background—country by country. She offers up some excellent anecdotes, and ponders on her hardline honesty. Tune in for her invigorating perspectives!</itunes:summary>

Andrew Brown, Co-Founder and Cloud Instructor at ExamPro Training Inc certainly is, but his presence in the community is so much more!

Andrew talks about the various internet platforms that he stays active on, and his mission to provide education on the cloud. Importantly so, Andrew does so with an immense amount of generosity. As he puts it, he couldn’t imagine taking money for the courses that he has created. Andrew and Corey discuss at length their thoughts on cloud certifications, the worth of multicloud, and much more! </itunes:summary>

Corey sits down for a group chat with Shir Tamari,  Head of Research at Wiz, and a couple of his esteemed colleagues; Nir Ohfield and Sagi Tzadik. While the structure is a tad different, the content is a frequent subject: security! Shir and his team of specialists at Wiz are making some serious research into cyber security, and in turn are developing some excellent insights. 

Shir, Nir, and Sagi reveal some of the cutting edge security research that they have been conducting. They’ve honed their research intent down to two primary responsibilities: find risks in cloud environments, and doing community research. Shir and co. break down the various vulnerabilities that their research has revealed, and the methods they’re developing to alleviate these multifarious risks.</itunes:summary>

I'm fascinated by the dynamics of high performance, and take great pride in building and supporting those teams. I also enjoy the intricacies of Systems Architecture, Design, and Implementation work. I like to use modern tools to solve difficult technology problems. I'm most excited by Automation, Observability, Data Engineering.  </p><p>I'm a product minded technologist. For the last 20 years working from Internet Service Providers and Hosting Companies to modern SaaS hosted on Cloud providers. I like to understand how people use the products that I build, and I like to build things that last a long time.</p><p>I consider product needs, business requirements, and technical capabilities when building products or planning new features. I work to understand the user and how and why they consume a service. All of our actions can impact many different ways, and I enjoy understanding how services, product teams, and business units work. I like to find ways to take one team's success and apply it more broadly, leveling up the entire business.  </p><p>I like to get things done. I'm not too fond of unnecessary processes that slow down progress. I like iterative improvements, bringing new features into users' hands as quickly as possible, even if they are tiny changes. I want to share what I learn—both internal to a company and external to a broader community. </p><p>I enjoy the business side of technology as much as the technical side. I went back to school and received my MBA to understand the language of business. I enjoyed my product and finance classes the most. I like to understand the financial impact of product decisions. I don't like waste (in time or money), and I also believe premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li>Last Tweet in AWS: <a href="https://lasttweetinaws.com/">https://lasttweetinaws.com</a></li><li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/petecheslock">https://twitter.com/petecheslock</a></li><li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecheslock/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecheslock/</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]>

For the last 20 years working from Internet Service Providers and Hosting Companies to modern SaaS hosted on Cloud providers. I like to understand how people use the products that I build, and I like to build things that last a long time.</p><p>I consider product needs, business requirements, and technical capabilities when building products or planning new features. I work to understand the user and how and why they consume a service. All of our actions can impact many different ways, and I enjoy understanding how services, product teams, and business units work. I like to find ways to take one team's success and apply it more broadly, leveling up the entire business.  </p><p>I like to get things done. I'm not too fond of unnecessary processes that slow down progress. I like iterative improvements, bringing new features into users' hands as quickly as possible, even if they are tiny changes. I want to share what I learn—both internal to a company and external to a broader community. </p><p>I enjoy the business side of technology as much as the technical side. I went back to school and received my MBA to understand the language of business. I enjoyed my product and finance classes the most. I like to understand the financial impact of product decisions. I don't like waste (in time or money), and I also believe premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li>Last Tweet in AWS: <a href="https://lasttweetinaws.com/">https://lasttweetinaws.com</a></li><li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/petecheslock">https://twitter.com/petecheslock</a></li><li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecheslock/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/petecheslock/</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Pete Cheslock, Cloud Economist and Duckbill Group alum, sits down with Corey for their annual tradition of re:Invent re:Cap. After 2020’s generally crappy virtual event, and this years arguable awkward “hybrid” event, Pete and Corey have many coals to rake over. 

Pete and Corey talk about the general weirdness of the 2021 re:Invent amidst a still on going pandemic. One topic of conversation is the relentless insistence of certain companies to do what the customer asks, without even asking if they should. Pete expounds on some of the offerings to come out of re:Invent, and he and Corey try to sift through the chaff for some of the wheat.</itunes:summary>

Maciej and Cloudash got put on blast by Corey on Twitter, but for all the right reasons! Maciej goes into the details on Cloudash and how it works as a native desktop app for Mac. Maciej talks about all the areas that Cloudash is covering down from Lambda to CloudFront and others. Corey is a happy customer completely on his own! Listen in as he and Maciej take a deep dive into the technical aspects of Cloudash, and what Maciej has created is something really unique!</itunes:summary>

I’m somewhat skeptical, but their customers seem to really like them, so that’s one of those areas where I really have a hard time being too snarky about it because when you solve a customer’s problem and they get out there in public and say, “We’re solving a problem,” it’s very hard to snark about that. Multus Medical, Construx.ai and Stax have seen significant results by using them. And it’s worth exploring.

I’m Corey Quinn. I’m joined today by Matt Coulter, who is a Technical Architect at Liberty Mutual. You may have had the privilege of seeing him on the keynote stage at re:Invent last year—in Las Vegas or remotely—that last year of course being 2021. But if you make better choices than the two of us did, and found yourself not there, take the chance to go and watch that keynote. It’s really worth seeing.</p><p>Matt, first, thank you for joining me. I’m sorry, I don’t have 20,000 people here in the audience to clap this time. They’re here, but they’re all remote as opposed to sitting in the room behind me because you know, social distancing.</p><p>Matt: And this left earphone, I just have some applause going, just permanently, just to keep me going. [laugh].</p><p>Corey: That’s sort of my own internal laugh track going on. It’s basically whatever I say is hilarious, to that. So yeah, doesn’t really matter what I say, how I say it, my jokes are all for me. It’s fine. So, what was it like being on stage in front of that many people? It’s always been a wild experience to watch and for folks who haven’t spent time on the speaking circuit, I don’t think that there’s any real conception of what that’s like. Is this like giving a talk at work, where I just walk on stage randomly, whatever I happened to be wearing? And, oh, here’s a microphone, I’m going to say words. What is the process there?</p><p>Matt: It’s completely different. For context for everyone, before the pandemic, I would have pretty regularly talked in front of, I don’t know, maybe one, two hundred people in Liberty, in Belfast. So, I used to be able to just, sort of, walk in front of them, and lean against the pillar, and use my clicker, and click through, but the process for actually presenting something as big as a keynote and re:Invent is so different. For starters, you think that when you walk onto the stage, you’ll actually be able to see the audience, but the way the lights are set up, you can pretty much see about one row of people, and they’re not the front row, so anybody I knew, I couldn’t actually see.</p><p>And yeah, you can only see, sort of like, the from the void, and then you have your screens, so you’ve six sets of screens that tell you your notes as well as what slides you’re on, you know, so you can pivot. But other than that, I mean, it feels like you’re just talking to yourself outside of whenever people, thankfully, applause. It’s such a long process to get there.</p><p>Corey: I’ve always said that there are a few different transition stages as the audience size increases, but for me, the final stage is more or less anything above 750 people. Because as you say, you aren’t able to see that many beyond that point, and it doesn’t really change anything meaningfully. The most common example that you see in the wild is jokes that work super well with a small group of people fall completely flat to large audiences. It’s why so much corporate numerous cheesy because yeah, everyone in the rehearsals is sitting there laughing and the joke kills, but now you’ve got 5000 people sitting in a room and that joke just sounds strained and forced because there’s no longer a conversation, and no one has the shared context that—the humor has to change. So, in some cases when you’re telling a story about what you’re going to say on stage, during a rehearsal, they’re going to say, “Well, that joke sounds really corny and lame.” It’s, “Yeah, wait until you see it in front of an audience. It will land very differently.” And I’m usually right on that.</p><p>I would also advise, you know, doing what you do and having something important and useful to say, as opposed to just going up there to tell jokes the whole time. I wanted to talk about that because you talked about how you’re using various CDK and other serverless style patterns in your work at Liberty Mutual.</p><p>Matt: Yeah. So, we’ve been using CDK pretty extensively since it was, sort ...</p>]]>

Matt and Corey talk about what it is like to present in front of such large audiences. Matt also divulges some of the details on what Liberty Mutual has working on in the cloud. Notably so, Matt chimes up on what all he has been worked on in CDK. For Matt a focus on reusable and well built tools in CDK and how they’re solving issues is crucial, as well as taking some architectural bounds at Liberty Mutual. Check out his take on all things CDK!</itunes:summary>

Miles breaks down SADA and their partnership with Google Cloud. He goes into some details on what GCP has been up to, and talks about the various areas they are capitulating forward. Miles talks about working with Thomas Kurian, who is the only who counts since he follows Corey on Twitter, and the various profundities that GCP has at hand. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>No company names are off limits for some often deserved snark here on “Screaming,” but Jamf pretty much takes care of itself. Levi McCormick, Cloud Architect at Jamf, is here to defend their honor—we kid. In reality Levi’s role at the enterprise architecture team over at Jamf gives him a high level, enterprise view of the cloud and in turn gives him some valuable takes.

Corey and Levi talk about Duckbill Group’s use of Jamf, which for them is primarily centered around hardware. Now, Jamf has their head in the cloud and Levi and his team are crucial to that progress.  Levi talks about the day to day operations of his team, and where they focus their energy and efforts to build out their products. Levi also offers some excellent insight on how to keep your various teams consistent, efficient, and perhaps most important—happy. Check it out!</itunes:summary>

Aaron was making his first trip to the US just for re:Invent, and somehow managed to survive it and Vegas. Despite the miasmic nature of it all, Aaron walked away with some stories under his belt.

Aaron talks about his prep work for re:Invent, which included watching “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.” But, more importantly, Aaron discusses what he is most excited about following his trip and all the announcements. Aaron also offers some takes on sustainability and the cloud, and provides some hopeful perspectives on a topic that is so steeped in cynicism. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>We shouldn’t forget security until the very end—and Ell Marquez, Security Research Advocate at Intezer, is here to keep us honest! Ell’s job title is just a minor indication about her own work in security, which can be so much more than blue hued charts (ahem, AWS)! Ell pipes up for some solid insight on how to step up the security game.

Ell shines the light on some of the esoteric nature of security, and the importance of entire organizations sharing the security responsibility. She offers her take on third party contractors, Target kerfuffles, and chats with Corey about Pokémon’s security choices. Ell’s security chops come to the forefront too, as she and Corey debate some of the importance of various practices, and as they talk about her own work as a podcaster and more!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Dan Woods, CISO and VP of Cybersecurity for Shipt (a Target subsidiary), has joined this Corey this week for a round of “Screaming.” Dan has recently come off an impressive stint as the CTO of the Biden campaign—the second staffer to join the “Screaming” line up! Dan has been at Target for years, which ended up serving as an experience that set him up for success in the political realm. 

Dan discusses his history at Target and the accolade of being a distinguished engineer. Dan goes into the challenges of tech leadership in the political sphere, where those under you are volunteers. He discusses some of the technical challenges they faced, which compliments well the insight of previous guest Jackie Singh. Dan breaks down the IC (individual contributor) role and how it has influenced his own leadership, and how he balanced it with his work in tech. </itunes:summary>

Now she has set down to chat with Corey to cover the open source spread. From her own work, to things that need change, to what works, Julia has a lot to offer!

Julia talks about the general project at Open Source Stories, and the ways they are making the user a primary motivation when building out products. She and Corey reflect on the open source community and what her definition of open source is. They take a deep dive into some of the nuances of open source and Julia’s observations are articulate, well thought out, and worthwhile.</itunes:summary>

From across the pond in jolly old England we are joined by Jake Hendy, a Technical Lead at the Met Office, to inform us about what it is like to work on the cloud for a government. Avoid the knee jerk reaction of “should governments be working on things that crash all the time?” and take a moment to hear Jake’s take.

Jake discusses his work at the UK’s National Meteorological Service and the wide array of work they do, and the various organizations they do that work with. From NATO to airlines to supermarkets, the Met Office and Jake’s work is a pretty fascinating space to keep an eye on. Jake goes into how institutional figures like his own office are using the cloud, and the possibilities that they can leverage to the field.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>For the first in-person episode in quite some time, Corey is joined by Sahir Azam, Chief Product Officer at MongoDB. Recording during the madness known as re:Invent, Sahir has graciously taken some time to bring us up to speed on what the folks at MongoDB have been up to, both in their work with AWS and outside of it. With re:Invent in the rearview, Sahir reflects upon MongoDB’s week well spent.

Sahir and Corey discuss MongoDB’s history as a “staple of the internet” and how MongoDB is now set in stone as one of the leading cloud database companies. MongoDB has made purpose a central focus for its database build. This purpose is something the company provides to its customer base as a wide array of organizations make the transition to the cloud. Sahir and Corey discuss the nuances of general purpose databases and their potential shortfalls, plus how to craft a more specific database that allows space for innovation. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Here on “Screaming” we like to shine the light on peoples’ best work, but with folks like Sam Ramji, Chief Strategy Officer at DataStax, the question is where to start? From early days at Microsoft, to throwing his weight into leading DevOps management at Google Cloud, Sam has a storied career. Now, Sam is leaning even more into his education and learning more about cognition within an organization. 

Sam’s offerings on how to build out what he calls “distributed cognition” are fascinating. For Sam there are ways for the systems you are building out to reflect how larger groups think across an organization. Sam discusses the importance of open source technologies and the influence he had in Microsoft in that space. From the intersection of money and the cloud, to audits, to cross cloud capabilities—these unruly subjects are just the beginning! Tune in for Sam’s, counter to Corey’s line, serious observations!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to the week of re:Quinnvent! Starting off this week's special 5 day run of "Screaming" is Rachel Stephens, who has returned for another round. Rachel, a Senior Analyst with RedMonk, catches up with Corey about what has been going on at RedMonk since her last visit. A visit that was right before the pandemic, so needless to say a lot has changed. Rachel is here to tell us how RedMonk has been dealing with these unforeseen shifts!

Rachel entered the lockdown finding out she was pregnant, so “change” took on an even deeper meaning for her! Rachel walks us through her own journey of having her second child, and the intricacies of being a parent and a mom. Rachel offers a lot of insight into the state of the tech world and its thus far lacking track record when it comes to accounting for parenthood. But her observations don’t end there. Rachel has a lot to say about the cloud as well. Check out her take!</itunes:summary>

While Stephanie is certainly a key player at such a massive company, her passion lies in her own advocacy for women in tech as well as making tech more approachable to larger audiences. 

Stephanie is not one to put her job title first. Her bio covers the spread from dancer, to hip-hop medalist, to podcast host. Stephanie gives us the birds eye view on her own non-traditional and interdisciplinary path that led to her work both in and outside of Google. Stephanie’s focus on producing content that reaches across a wide spectrum of participants is crucial to how she has broken the mold on what tech can do, and her lessons are ones we can all learn from.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>This week Corey is joined by someone he has been antagonizing for years now. Brian Hall, VP of Product and Industry Marketing at Google Cloud, is here to chat about a disagreement that he and Corey had on the long worn question; how much time should one spend in a job? But thankfully, their conversation doesn’t limit itself to just that!

Corey and Brian chat about how Twitter’s failure to capture nuance and context can lead to some unfortunate mis-interpretations. Brian offers some insight on his significant amount of time spent at Microsoft under various roles.

      <itunes:summary>This week Cory is joined by Scott Johnston, CEO of (the church) of Docker, to talk about none other than Docker itself! Scott brought his previous experience to the table in 2013 where, as he says, he “first typed ‘docker run’...and hasn’t looked back.” Docker’s community and their fervor is well known, and Scott has much to say about it!

Join the discussion as Scott goes into how he left Puppet after some exposure to Corey to become the CEO at Docker. Scott tells us what exactly Docker is, and where it starts, which is the community around it. Scott talks about the reset that Docker went through in November of 2019, where they decided to make the developer the focus of their mission. He also dives into Docker’s upcoming changes, and offers some insight into why they are instituting some of these changes. The big one being Docker Desktop, which Scott goes into the details on. Check out this episode for more!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>This week Chloe Condon, Senior Cloud Advocate for Microsoft, is back again! Which is surprising because between her last episode and now she and Corey have hung out plenty. Chloe is now working on the Next Generation Experiences team at Microsoft, but that is perhaps the least interesting thing she's been up to lately! Chloe has a lot of great insight on how to navigate the interest as well!

Chloe recently started the Master Creep Theatre (yes, with the British spelling) which is a project to bring some more creative and artistic efforts into the tech world! Given Chloe’s non-traditional background she’s able to bring a lot of great perspective to weaving these two worlds together. Chloe also discusses the politics of navigating DMs as a woman on the internet, fun. Her and Corey discuss internet culture in general and how to make the most of it, in spite of all the baggage. Tune in for Chloe's take!</itunes:summary>

Nick breaks down what exactly is an analyst firm, and why companies should care. Nick has some worthwhile insights into what an analyst can bring to the table for companies. Nick’s perspectives are certainly well founded and offer a lot on how to navigate that space successfully.  Nick and Corey also go down the kaleidoscopic nature of observability, how Nick ended up at Cribl, and how Cribl is bringing forth some serious innovations in regards to observability.

Abby and Corey discuss their respective work in configuration management. They also dive into how sometimes companies don’t always get to where they need to as quickly as they should, especially when it comes to cloud migration. Turns out, people are an important part of solving these transitional issues! Abby offers her take on how to smooth out the people part of tech and how she makes it a focus of her work because, as it turns out, it is the hardest work out there!

Tim’s insights are very useful, thus why he is back as a team member! Check them out.

Tim and Corey go into the detais of Tim’s new job title, and how a background in engineering is fundamental to working well in that role. They also discuss Tim’s slightly diverging philosophy building out resilience, security, and costs on “the whiteboard.” By doing so Tim discusses how this can help you from accruing debt that needs to be paid later on and the importance that practice can have on cost optimization, observability, and more.

Emma is also an author and a co-host of the Ladybug Podcast and Emma also has a strong following on Twitter to boot. Where, it turns out, her thoughts and opinions are quite valuable and worth sharing!

Emma goes into the details on her podcast and the varied nature of her and her co-hosts, she also discusses her book Decoding the Technical Interview Process, in which she breaks down the seemingly esoteric nature of interviewing for these highly technical jobs—but her focus is on the frontend. She and Corey discuss the general banality of these interviews and the direction they can, and should, go in to improve. Emma also loves to teach, to add even more to her portfolio! She goes into the five w’s of her work with LinkedIn Learning and Frontend Masters. Emma also has some excellent insights into her sizable Twitter presence. Tune in for Emma’s variegated offerings! </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>This week Corey is joined by Jesse Vincent, Co-founder and CTO of Keyboardio, and the master of the keyboards. Jesse and his company are revolutionizing mechanical keyboards, and have made it their mission to make them more than noisy office nuances. Jesse and Keyboardio take their place at the forefront of the emergence of a new mechanical keyboard revolution.

Jesse and Corey discuss both of their pasts with keyboards and how it shaped the way Jesse thinks about, builds, and continues to innovate how to think about them. Jesse’s past has helped to reinforce the things he does, and equally important, does not like about mechanical keyboards. From making choices on the kind of wood, to the general mess of supply chains in 2020, to legal battles in China! Tune in for the rest!</itunes:summary>

Serena discusses their mix of traditional and non-traditional background and making the jump from electrical engineering to tech. Serena tells us about their beginnings at Optum and the different, and welcome, challenges of moving from system to system as an SRE.

They talk about what Serena carrys forward from their background, starting in security and moving over to becoming an SRE and learning Docker. Corey and Serena also discuss the interminable nature of the cloud and the vast differences between when we’re footing the AWS bill—and when its the company’s problem! It turns out Serena learned some tricks on keeping costs down by tuning in to the various “Last Week in AWS” podcasts. You can do the same!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Sean Kilgore is a senior principal engineer/architect at Twilio. Sean brings more than two decades worth of tech experience to this role. Previously, he worked as a principal engineer II/operations architect at SendGrid (which was acquired by Twilio), an operations engineer at Beachhead Studio, and an associate system administrator at Blizzard Entertainment, among other positions.

Join Corey and Sean as they talk about becoming a manager and underestimating the emotional outlay that's needed to manage humans effectively, the difference between engineers and architects and what it's like to influence without authority, what the transition was like after Twilio purchased SendGrid, what it's like to have 11 job titles in eight years at one company, how staying at the same company for too long often results in underpaid employees but how Twilio has shattered that mold, how you can tell a lot about a company by the way they buy their people, and more.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>This week Nigel Kersten, Field CTO at Puppet, joins Corey to talk about their respective companies relationship and what all it entails. They rehash Corey’s time spent as a traveling contract trainer for Puppet and the ins and outs of that time. To include the challenges of describing what exactly Puppet is and how it works to clients. They also dive into the differences between then and now on DevOps, and tech at large.

In short, Puppet is a DSL (domain specific language). Nigel and Corey divulge the details on what that is, how it works, and how to translate it over to a larger, not so technical, world. They also reflect on how Docker handed over the keys and some of the attachments we have to a techno-social system. Nigel speaks on the innovations that have changed along the way and the impact they’ve had in the industry. Especially those that have a tendency to cling to “legacy.”</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Owen Rogers wears many hats at 451 Research; he’s the vice president of cloud transformation and digital economics, the research director for the firm’s digital economics unit, and a senior analyst for digital economics. Prior to these positions, Owen was a doctoral researcher in cloud computing at the University of Bristol, completing his PhD thesis in 2013; a product portfolio manager at Claranet; and an independent product management and cloud computing consultant, among other positions.

Join Corey and Owen as they talk about what it’s like when two cloud economists meet at an event but only one has a PhD, what exactly an industry analyst does, how 451 Research found that 53% of companies increased cloud spend during the pandemic and what resources they’re investing in, the Law of Cloud Entropy and why Owen believes the cloud will only get more disordered in the future, why it’s easy for cloud costs to spiral out of control, how organizations are trying to rein in cloud spend despite using more cloud services, why Owen doesn’t believe we’ll reach cloud commoditization anytime soon, and more.</itunes:summary>

Join Corey and Alan as they talk about what exactly it is that a DevOps lead does, how there’s a big world out there and not every company is a SaaS startup in the Bay Area that hemorrhages money, how it turns out that running an Oracle database in Oracle Cloud isn’t the worst thing in the world, how everyone is using serverless but nobody’s using it properly, learning curves and and how they make it hard to unlock the full power of AWS, why Alan is a big fan of the book Accelerate, and more.</itunes:summary>

Regis brings more than 25 years of tech experience to this position, having worked as an infrastructure architect and SRE at TrueCar, Inc. and a cloud systems architect at Live Nation, among several other positions. Oh yeah: He also used to be Corey’s boss. 

Join Corey and Regis as they talk about what it was like to have Corey as an employee, what Release does and what environments as a service means, how Regis likes working with the people he enjoys working with repeatedly, how the speed of provisioning resources has accelerated over the last decade, what it was like for Regis to switch jobs during a pandemic and why he decided to make the gamble, how at—at one point in his career—Corey’s core competency was getting fired, what Release’s monetization strategy is, how to spin up a Minecraft server for free, and more.</itunes:summary>

Tim brings more than 20 years of experience to the role, having worked as technical account manager at Mission Cloud (an AWS Premier Consulting Partner), a technical account manager at AWS, a site reliability engineer at Elastic, a DevOps engineer at ObjectRocket, a senior database administrator at TEKsystems, and a LAMP systems architect at Charles Schwab, among other positions. Prior to launching a career in tech, Tim enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps as a musician before being reassigned to avionics. 

Join Corey and Tim as they talk about why Tim decided to make the leap to Equinix Metal, how you’re more likely to get a bigger raise by switching companies than pursuing the traditional promotion track, why Tim starts interviewing for new jobs on his one-year anniversary of any gig, how many corporations conduct a hazing of sorts during the interview process by asking candidates to perform ridiculous tasks they’d never perform if they got the job, why job titles are important, why Netflix doesn’t stream anything on AWS, why cloud costs are never predictable, and more.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Chris Porter is the director of solutions engineering at StackRox, makers of the industry’s first Kubernetes-native container security platform. Previously, Chris worked as the director of field sales engineers at Bracket Computing, a technical solutions architect and senior manager of systems engineering at Cisco, and a software engineer at VA Software, iBeam Broadcasting, and Silicon Graphics, among other positions. He is also an author and a certified AWS solutions architect and security specialist.

Join Corey and Chris as they talk about bringing security to Kubernetes while touching upon how nobody really manages application security—they just pretend to; why security needs to think the same way as microservices; how a lot of people end up using the container model incorrectly by thinking they’re the same as VMs; what billing and security have in common; why security needs to be baked into the foundation vs. treated as an afterthought; why you should aim for incremental security improvements; what Chris thinks the business value of Kubernetes is; why Chris doesn’t think moving applications to containers automatically makes them more secure, and more.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Jason McKay is the CTO/SVP at Logicworks, a provider of cloud migration and managed cloud services for AWS and Azure customers. After stints in technical support and system administration, he joined Logicworks in 2006 as a senior engineer and moved through the ranks there, ascending to director of engineering and VP of engineering before assuming his current role.

Join Corey and Jason as they discuss Jason’s impressive career trajectory, what exactly a managed service provider does, how Logicworks is different than the run-of-the-mill MSP, how Jason believes MSPs should work as the R&amp;amp;D arm of their clients, what to look for in an MSP that you might actually want to work with, how there aren’t really any public cloud-to-public cloud migrations but there are customers running in multiple clouds, how one of Logicworks’ apps that runs on AWS and Azure is architected, how much that extra nine of uptime costs, what a terrible client for Logicworks looks like, and more.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Ev Kontsevoy is the co-founder and CEO of Gravitational, a company that builds open source tools to help developers securely deliver cloud-native apps to restricted and regulated environments. Ev has more than two decades of experience in tech. Over the years, he’s worked as the director of product and strategy at Rackspace, a lead engineer at GE Security, and a software engineer at National Instruments. He also co-founded Mailgun, an API-based email delivery service acquired by Rackspace.

Join Corey and Ev as they talk about how Gravitational helps developers secure production environments and deploy apps anywhere in the world, how engineers tend to be able to access systems from companies they no longer work for, the semantics of the cloud and how some definitions are still fluid, how open source products are sometimes unpolished and why that’s not necessarily a bad thing, what it was like when Mailgun was acquired by Rackspace, how Gravitational is bringing simplicity back to software development, why Ev’s ideal version of any software product is “unmanaged,” and more.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Adithya Reddy is a software developer at Branch Insurance, a serverless insurance startup that sells bundled home and auto insurance products. In this role, he does it all—web, mobile, and backend architecture. After being hired as the company’s first frontend developer, Adithya expanded across the stack. Adithya graduated from Visvesvaraya Technological University with a bachelor of engineering degree in computer science in 2018.

Join Corey and Adithya as they discuss what it’s like to build a startup that operates in a heavily regulated industry on serverless architecture, Adithya’s experience as being hired as the first developer at Branch Insurance, how serverless helps remove all sorts of tasks from the average developer’s plate and reduces the barrier of entry, how going serverless locks you into the AWS ecosystem at least for the near term and why that’s not necessarily a bad thing, why the Branch Insurance team uses CloudFormation instead of Terraform, and more.</itunes:summary>

Melanie has many opinions, which are her own, and which do not reflect the opinions or views of her employer.

Join Corey and Melanie as they discuss the differences between junior, senior, staff, and principal engineers, what a staff engineer’s job looks like at Airbnb, why cloud cost efficiency is a hard-but-great problem to work on, why some engineers are hesitant to turn anything off, how much of optimizing cloud spend involves picking off low-hanging fruit, why it’s more fun to talk to technologists about cloud problems than vendors, how Airbnb uses Kubernetes and what that means for AWS spend analysis, and more. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Tobi Knaup is the co-founder and CTO of D2iQ, an enterprise-grade cloud platform provider that helps customers build cloud-native applications. In his spare time, he doubles as continuity advisor at Y Combinator. Previously, Tobi worked as a tech lead at Airbnb, signing on as the fourth engineer and helping scale the company’s product to millions of users around the world. He also co-founded Knaup Multimedia, a company that built websites for small- and medium-sized businesses, when he was 15.

Join Corey and Tobi as they discuss why Mesosphere rebranded as D2iQ and what that new name means; why the Kubernetes community deserves the credit for the widespread adoption of the container orchestration platform; how D2iQ helps customers build end-to-end data pipelines with tools like Kafka, Cassandra, and Spark; how D2iQ solves one industrial IoT use case with a mini edge cloud; how many people assume Kubernetes is all they need, why that’s a mistake, and what other tools they end up having to use; why Tobi thinks that multi-cloud is the future; what it was like for Tobi to grow up in Germany and hear about Silicon Valley; joining Airbnb as the company’s fourth engineer; and more.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Years ago, if you wanted to launch an Internet company or Web application, you had to own necessary hardware. Now, the economics have changed drastically with the ease of Cloud computing. It’s still a new industry that people are trying to figure out, especially when it comes to cost and optimization.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Dann Berg, a Cloud ops analyst at Datadog. He helps others understand and lower the cost of Cloud operations. Dann is a detective who is dedicated to figuring out why a company’s Cloud bill is so high.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies struggle with field of Cloud economics; can be overwhelming because there’s so much to learn about products and implementation</li>
<li>Companies use the Cloud to grow quickly, which makes their Cloud costs grow quickly and more than expected</li>
<li>Only access to full list of every resource being used is the Cloud bill; there’s no comprehensive inventory service available</li>
<li>Companies need to offer visibility to Cloud bill; not everyone has access to understand how their actions impact the bill </li>
<li>Cost of Cloud bill is dependant on different factors, including new features, new users, and cost of goods sold (COGS)</li>
<li>Scale and manage bill by using a platform app or hiring a consultant/team</li>
<li>Understand pricing of AWS and learn best practices for cost controls early on</li>
<li>Don’t leave money on the table by focusing on engineering time - not best use of resources; focus on the smallest things that have the biggest impact</li>
<li>Cost is important, but don’t slow down those developing in the Cloud; open lines of communication to create culture to understand cost, value what’s measured</li>

      <itunes:summary>Years ago, if you wanted to launch an Internet company or Web application, you had to own necessary hardware. Now, the economics have changed drastically with the ease of Cloud computing. It’s still a new industry that people are trying to figure out, especially when it comes to cost and optimization.
Today, we’re talking to Dann Berg, a Cloud ops analyst at Datadog. He helps others understand and lower the cost of Cloud operations. Dann is a detective who is dedicated to figuring out why a company’s Cloud bill is so high.
Some of the highlights of the show include:

Companies struggle with field of Cloud economics; can be overwhelming because there’s so much to learn about products and implementation
Companies use the Cloud to grow quickly, which makes their Cloud costs grow quickly and more than expected
Only access to full list of every resource being used is the Cloud bill; there’s no comprehensive inventory service available
Companies need to offer visibility to Cloud bill; not everyone has access to understand how their actions impact the bill 
Cost of Cloud bill is dependant on different factors, including new features, new users, and cost of goods sold (COGS)
Scale and manage bill by using a platform app or hiring a consultant/team
Understand pricing of AWS and learn best practices for cost controls early on
Don’t leave money on the table by focusing on engineering time - not best use of resources; focus on the smallest things that have the biggest impact
Cost is important, but don’t slow down those developing in the Cloud; open lines of communication to create culture to understand cost, value what’s measured

      <itunes:summary>Companies can find working in the Cloud quite complicated. However, it’s a lot easier than it used to be, especially when trying to comply with regulations. That’s because Cloud providers have evolved and now offer more out-of-the-box services that focus on regulation requirements and compliance.
Today, we’re talking to Elliot Murphy. He’s the founder of Kindly Ops, which provides consulting advice to companies dealing with regulated workloads in the Cloud.
Some of the highlights of the show include:

Technical controls are easier, but requirements are stricter
Risk Analysis: Putting locks on things to thinking about risks to customers
Building governance and controls; making data available and removable 
Secondary Losses: Scrub services to make scope and magnitude of loss smaller
Computing became ubiquitous and affordable; people started collecting data to utilize later - nobody gets rid of anything 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) set of regulations apply to marketing technology stacks to manage systems
Empathy building exercise and security culture diagnostic help companies understand compliance obligations
Security Culture: Beliefs and assumptions that drive decisions and actions
Evolution of understanding with public Cloud’s security and availability
Raise the bar and shift mindset from pure prevention to early detection/ mitigation; follow FAIR (factor analysis of information risk)

<li>Report gathered more than 160 million data points by leveraging ThousandEyes’ global fleet of agents that simulate users’ application traffic</li>
<li>Data collected during four-week period was ran through ThousandEyes’ global inference engine to identify trends and detect anomalies</li>
<li>Internet X factor when calibrating network performance of public Cloud providers; best-effort medium that has no predictability and is vulnerable to attacks</li>
<li>AWS’ performance predictability was lower than GCP Cloud and Azure leveraged their own backbones to move user traffic</li>
<li>Certain regions, such as Asia, were handled better by GCP and Azure than AWS</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking for older services at AWS, there really aren’t any. For example, Simple Storage Service (S3) has been with us since the beginning. It was the first publicly launched service that was quickly followed by Simple Queue Service (SQS). Still today, when it comes to these services, simplicity is key!</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, vice president of S3 at AWS. Many people use S3 the same way that they have for years, such as for backups in the Cloud. However, others have taken S3 and ran with it to find a myriad of different use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data: Where do I put it? What do I do with it?</li>
<li>S3 Select and Cross-Region Replication (CRR) make it easier and cheaper to use and manage data </li>
<li>Customer feedback drives AWS S3 price options and tiers</li>
<li>Using Glacier and S3 together for archive data storage; decisions and constraints that affect people’s use and storage of data</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you have some spare time? Can you figure out an easier way to do something? Then, why not build some software?! </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Ian Mckay of Kablamo, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) consultancy. He is the author of Console Recorder, which is a browser extension that records your actions in the Management Console to convert them into SDK code and infrastructure as code templates.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Timeline to build Console Recorder</li>
<li>Infrastructure as Code: How to code repeatedly without starting over and take ownership of what you built by hand</li>
<li>AWS vs. Individual Achievements: People asked AWS for years to create something to record console click-throughs that Ian did in his spare time</li>
<li>Console Recorder support for any browser that exports Web extensions</li>
<li>Sharp edges of what’s expected of Console Recorder to speed up development</li>
<li>Management Console’s unreadable responses require reverse engineering</li>
<li>Console Recorder: Recommended use cases and areas </li>
<li>How to alleviate security concerns with Console Recorder</li>
<li>Changes to Management Console that may break things </li>
<li>Ian’s past, present, and future projects and products</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>A Manager README is a document designed to establish clarity between a manager and those who report to them. These documents are especially useful for onboarding content. For example, if you have someone new starting on your team, there's so many things you need to share with them - pieces of advice and guidance that help them to make the best decision about what to do in specific situations. A Manager README sets some expectations in advance to make things easier and reduce friction and anxiety for team members. </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Matt Newkirk, who manages Etsy’s localization and translation group. He explains that even if your company has an intensive onboarding program and review process, some things are still left out. A Manager README is a helpful and proactive piece of content that prompts conversations about how people perceive things.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid writing READMEs that are extremely self-centered/arrogant</li>
<li>READMEs clarify what to do until a relationship is established between the manager and their employee</li>
<li>Get feedback early on to make sure that what you include in the document is helpful; it should reflect reality and be discussed</li>
<li>Share README with your manager to make sure you’re both on the same page about team philosophies and expectations</li>
<li>README is a living document that needs to be updated occasionally because things change</li>
<li>README adds context; it’s not designed to make employee feel like they’re back in school and panicking because they’re not prepared </li>
<li>Manager README - Not Matt’s best selection of terminology</li>
<li>Who’s the best boss you ever had? Why? They can be a force that shapes your life and career from the right perspective</li>
<li>Philosophy of Management: Don’t do what terrible managers have done; be transparent about strategic reasons for priorities changing</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Would you like access to unlimited retention of your data within your Amazon S3, which costs far less than online storage on disc? Well, the next time you’re at re:Invent, visit CHAOSSEARCH’s booth.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Pete Cheslock, vice president of products at CHAOSSEARCH and former vice president of operations at Threat Stack. CHAOSSEARCH helps people get access to their login event data using Amazon S3.</p>

<li>Densify Drama: Conference flyer to generate leads failed, created complaints</li>
<li>Track and analyze data, but don’t use it to invade privacy or become creepy</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>You can't make money selling to developers! The bottleneck of getting business requirements and creating business value used to mean waiting for the next waterfall release. That’s not the case anymore in the venture community. There’s programmatic access to infrastructure and DevOps/agile developments that offer super-fast cycle times. Now, the bottleneck is about how fast your developers can move and how much they can get done. </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Joseph Ruscio, general partner at Heavybit Industries, which is an accelerator for seed-stage companies and focuses on developer-first products. Tools and products that get you more leverage out of your developers are incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring maturity of startups’ engineering teams by looking at SaaS list - what products they have in place and how many are using out-of-house vendors</li>
<li>Customers don’t care how curated or artisan a piece of your stack is, they only care that it works</li>
<li>Not all claims (scales infinitely or never fails) are true when it comes to products on the market, so people are skeptical</li>
<li>Heavybit focuses on helping businesses build a bottoms-up, grassroots community around its products and a disciplined inside/direct sales motion </li>
<li>Build vs. Buy: Whatever people try to do themselves is a costly, pale imitation of something they can buy</li>
<li>Advice for New Entrepreneurs: Never compete with AWS on hosting compute because it will obliterate and Amazon is great at plumbing, terrible at painting</li>
<li>AWS’s version of your product won't be as sophisticated; continually work on it to deliver a more seamless product and customer success experience</li>
<li>Measure downtime/outages in terms of dollars by using monitoring tools that deliver more holistic, integrated, comprehensive experience than CloudWatch</li>
<li>Starting a company is easier; even if you're the 800-pound gorilla in the category you created, keep innovating and building or Amazon’s coming after you</li>
<li>Azure, unlike GCP, has ability to meet customers where they are, rather than telling them where they should be</li>
<li>Understand the problem your customer is trying to solve and understand how far out of their current comfort zone they're willing to go to solve that problem</li>
<li>Software exists to create business value; it doesn't matter what it's written in or how it's hosted, so some systems will be around for a long time</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you like to hear yourself talk? Especially while on a stage and in front of a lot of people? How do you come up with ideas to talk about? What process do you use to build a conference talk or presentation? </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Matty Stratton of PagerDuty. His job involves building conference talks and finding ways to continuously improve them. Public speaking can be intimidating, so he shares some tips and tricks that have worked for him.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid creating something brand new for every event</li>
<li>Don’t tell flattering stories about things that happened to you; may be uplifting, but doesn't resemble reality</li>
<li>Failure stories are fantastic because people relate to making terrible decisions</li>
<li>Everyone who gives a talk panics, gets nervous, and thinks they’re about a sentence away from stammering and falling off the stage; almost never happens</li>
<li>Audience wants you to succeed because they're there to learn; no one is hoping a presenter messes up</li>
<li>Preparation is key; could build a talk at the last minute, but it would be much better, if you prepared for it</li>
<li>Don’t intentionally try to think of something; have conversations with people and listen to other talks to develop anecdotes, stories, and cold opens</li>
<li>Humor can be tricky; what you think is funny, other people might not</li>
<li>Make things memorable; show good ideas by showing bad ideas - it’s the ‘don't do this, do this instead’ model</li>
<li>Submit early and often, but submit appropriately; if you are always submitting stuff that’s inappropriate for an event, your stuff starts to be ignored</li>
<li>Sometimes, you may want to avoid slides that auto advance; if you trip over yourself: Stop, repeat, back up,  take questions, etc.</li>
<li>Try not to read from notes or slides; takes the life and engagement out of the talk</li>
<li>People can only do one thing at a time - listen or read</li>
<li>Practice: Record yourself every time you practice and watch it; focus on blocking and tackling</li>
<li>You have about 45 seconds to grab people's interest before they look at their phone; get them engaged via a story, picture, or anecdote</li>

<p>Today, we’re talking to Matty Stratton of PagerDuty. His job involves building conference talks and finding ways to continuously improve them. Public speaking can be intimidating, so he shares some tips and tricks that have worked for him.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid creating something brand new for every event</li>
<li>Don’t tell flattering stories about things that happened to you; may be uplifting, but doesn't resemble reality</li>
<li>Failure stories are fantastic because people relate to making terrible decisions</li>
<li>Everyone who gives a talk panics, gets nervous, and thinks they’re about a sentence away from stammering and falling off the stage; almost never happens</li>
<li>Audience wants you to succeed because they're there to learn; no one is hoping a presenter messes up</li>
<li>Preparation is key; could build a talk at the last minute, but it would be much better, if you prepared for it</li>
<li>Don’t intentionally try to think of something; have conversations with people and listen to other talks to develop anecdotes, stories, and cold opens</li>
<li>Humor can be tricky; what you think is funny, other people might not</li>
<li>Make things memorable; show good ideas by showing bad ideas - it’s the ‘don't do this, do this instead’ model</li>
<li>Submit early and often, but submit appropriately; if you are always submitting stuff that’s inappropriate for an event, your stuff starts to be ignored</li>
<li>Sometimes, you may want to avoid slides that auto advance; if you trip over yourself: Stop, repeat, back up,  take questions, etc.</li>
<li>Try not to read from notes or slides; takes the life and engagement out of the talk</li>
<li>People can only do one thing at a time - listen or read</li>
<li>Practice: Record yourself every time you practice and watch it; focus on blocking and tackling</li>
<li>You have about 45 seconds to grab people's interest before they look at their phone; get them engaged via a story, picture, or anecdote</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you understand how tabs work? How spaces work? Are you willing to defeat the JSON heretics? Most people understand the power of the serverless paradigm, but  need help to put it into a useful form. That’s where Stackery comes in to treat YAML as an assembly language. After all, no one programs processors like they did in the '80s with raw assembly routines and no one programs with C. Everyone is using a higher-level scripted or other programming language. </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Chase Douglas, co-founder and CTO of Stackery, which is serverless acceleration software where levels of abstraction empower you to move quickly. Stackery has an intricate binding model that gives you a visual representation - at a human logical level - of the infrastructure you defined in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stackery builds infrastructures by using best practices with security applications</li>
<li>What's a VPC? Way to put resources into a Cloud account that aren’t accessible outside of that network; anything in that network can talk to each other</li>
<li>Lambda layers let developers create one Git layer that includes multiple functionality and put it in all functions for consistency and management</li>
<li>Git is an open-source amalgam of different programming languages that has grown and changed over time, but it has its own build system</li>
<li>Stackery created a PHP runtime functionality for Lambda; you don't want to run your own runtime - leave that up to a Cloud service provider for security reasons</li>
<li>Should you refactor existing Lambda functions to leverage layers? No, rebuild everything already built before re-architecting everything to use serverless</li>
<li>Many companies find serverless to be useful for their types of workloads; about 95% of workloads can effectively be engineered on a serverless foundation</li>
<li>Trough of Disillusionment or Gartner Hype Cycle: Stackery wants to re-engage and help people who have had challenges with serverless</li>
<li>Is DynamoDB considered serverless? Yes, because it’s got global replication</li>
<li>Puritanical (being able to scale down to zero) and practical approaches to the definition of serverless </li>

        <![CDATA[<p>What’s hiring in the world of Cloud like? What are companies looking for in possible employees? What kind of career trajectory should applicants display?</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Don O’Neill, who has had an interesting career path and the archetype of who most companies want to hire. He’s been an independent contributor, platform leader, and Cloud consultant. Currently, Don is platform engineer manager at Articulate, an eLearning software solution for course authoring and eLearning development. He works with platform engineers to automate Blue Ocean pipelines with Docker, Terraform, and various Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies, such as Elastic Beanstalk.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don reached out to his network to ask people that he had a professional relationship with about who was hiring and what challenges they faced</li>
<li>Don’s “Therapy”: Go to meet-ups to talk about DevOps topics; serves as a “I’ve-got-to-get-my-hiney-out-of-the-house-and-get-some-social-time”</li>
<li>Don’s journey from being a “wee lad in the industry” to a senior member/leader and giving back as a way to recognize those who helped him along the way</li>
<li>Hiring Horror Stories: People going through borderline ridiculous levels of hiring games and terrible interview paradigms</li>
<li>Companies sometimes look for something too specific - exact match instead of fuzzy match; they never have time to train, but time to look for a perfect unicorn</li>
<li>Articulate’s Hiring Process: Day 1 - Slack interview; Day 2 - Technical pieces; and Day 3 - Pairing with others </li>
<li>Articulate looks for people enthusiastic about technology, able to learn, and with emotional intelligence; company values independence, autonomy, and respect</li>
<li>Companies that spend several hours to make a hiring decision tend to have less success with those they hire</li>
<li>Cloud Certificates/Certifications: Can be valuable for applicants with no real-world experience; they don’t indicate how they’re going to work or learn</li>
<li>Applicants need to demonstrate a base level of knowledge; if they don’t have a skill set, they should start a project to learn about something - learning is fun</li>
<li>If you’re established in your career, reach out to someone just starting out to guide them </li>
<li>If you’re starting out in your career, reach out to people to talk about the next steps to take in your career (contact <a href="mailto:Corey@screaminginthecloud.com">Corey</a> or <a href="mailto:sntxrr@gmail.com">Don</a>)</li>

      <itunes:summary>What’s hiring in the world of Cloud like? What are companies looking for in possible employees? What kind of career trajectory should applicants display?
Today, we’re talking to Don O’Neill, who has had an interesting career path and the archetype of who most companies want to hire. He’s been an independent contributor, platform leader, and Cloud consultant. Currently, Don is platform engineer manager at Articulate, an eLearning software solution for course authoring and eLearning development. He works with platform engineers to automate Blue Ocean pipelines with Docker, Terraform, and various Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies, such as Elastic Beanstalk.
Some of the highlights of the show include:

Don reached out to his network to ask people that he had a professional relationship with about who was hiring and what challenges they faced
Don’s “Therapy”: Go to meet-ups to talk about DevOps topics; serves as a “I’ve-got-to-get-my-hiney-out-of-the-house-and-get-some-social-time”
Don’s journey from being a “wee lad in the industry” to a senior member/leader and giving back as a way to recognize those who helped him along the way
Hiring Horror Stories: People going through borderline ridiculous levels of hiring games and terrible interview paradigms
Companies sometimes look for something too specific - exact match instead of fuzzy match; they never have time to train, but time to look for a perfect unicorn
Articulate’s Hiring Process: Day 1 - Slack interview; Day 2 - Technical pieces; and Day 3 - Pairing with others 
Articulate looks for people enthusiastic about technology, able to learn, and with emotional intelligence; company values independence, autonomy, and respect
Companies that spend several hours to make a hiring decision tend to have less success with those they hire
Cloud Certificates/Certifications: Can be valuable for applicants with no real-world experience; they don’t indicate how they’re going to work or learn
Applicants need to demonstrate a base level of knowledge; if they don’t have a skill set, they should start a project to learn about something - learning is fun
If you’re established in your career, reach out to someone just starting out to guide them 
If you’re starting out in your career, reach out to people to talk about the next steps to take in your career (contact Corey or Don)

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you enjoy watching sports? Wear your favorite team or player’s jersey? Are you a fan who has shopped at Fanatics on the Cloud? </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Johnny Sheeley, director of Cloud engineering at Fanatics, which is a sports eCommerce business that manufactures and sells sports apparel. Fanatics runs Cloud engineering to provide a robust and reliable set of services by building and deploying applications on top of the Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS) platform.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you compete with Amazon, be ready for it to come after you; some companies avoid its Cloud perspective or go multi-Cloud (paranoia-based movement)</li>
<li>Focus on your ability to make your business function smoothly</li>
<li>Transition, migration, and abstraction may be painful, but should not stop work; paying for Cloud-agnostic technology may not be worth it</li>
<li>Challenges of governing use of Cloud resources to prevent mistakes/problems related to Fanatics’ security and budget</li>
<li>Data collected focuses on what’s trending up or down to select an instance type that calculates costs; remain flexible and be aware of what you pay</li>
<li>Natural instinct is to blame people; mistakes are made, especially when a human factor is introduced to an automated system</li>
<li>Creating a mindset that focuses on feature and detail-oriented is challenging</li>
<li>Cottage industry of code bases running in Big Data and other expensive realms</li>
<li>As a product continues to evolve and grow, governance comes along for the ride and AWS bills are streamlined</li>
<li>Will serverless, Lambda, and RDS change how Amazon charges in the future?</li>
<li>State of scale of AWS and developing a more palatable method for releases because people can’t keep up with them and stop paying attention</li>
<li>Two-Pizza Team: Amazon’s management philosophy that any team that works on a service should be able to be fed with two pizzas </li>
<li>Such small teams work quickly and have the freedom to fail, but Amazon has a reliability for the longevity of its different services</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Did you know that you can now run Lambda functions for 15 minutes, instead of dealing with 5-minute timeouts? Although customers will probably never need that much time, it helps dispel the belief that serverless isn’t useful for some use cases because of such short time limits.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Adam Johnson, co-founder and CEO of IOpipe. He understands that some people may misuse the increased timeframe to implement things terribly. But he believes the responsibility of a framework, platform, or technology should not be to hinder certain use cases to make sure developers are working within narrow constraints. Substantial guardrails can make developers shy away. With Lambda, they can do what they want, which is good and bad.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies are using serverless as a foundation and for critical functions</li>
<li>Serverless can be painful in some areas, but gaps are going away </li>
<li>Investing in the Future: Companies doing lift-and-shift to AWS are looking at technology they should choose today that’s going to be prominent in 3 years</li>
<li>Serverless empowers new billing models and traces the flow of capital; companies can choose to make pricing more complicated or simplified </li>
<li>What value are you providing? Serverless can offer flexible pricing foundation</li>
<li>When something breaks, you need to be made aware of such problems; Amazon bill doesn’t change based on what IOpipe does, which is not true with others</li>
<li>Developers are the ones woken up and on call, so IOpipe focuses on providing them value and help; they are not left alone to figure out and fix problems</li>
<li>Serverless and event-driven applications offer a new type of instrumentation and observability to collect telemetry on every event  </li>
<li>For serverless to go mainstream, AWS needs to up its observability level to gather data to answer questions</li>
<li>AWS, in the serverless space, needs to make significant progress on cold starts in other languages, and offer more visibility and easier deployment out of the box</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the early days, angry nerd corners on the Internet viewed Slack and some of its predecessors as, “Oh, it’s just IRC.

<p>Today, we’re talking to Holly Allen, who helped make government software better while  serving as the director of engineering at 18F.

<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>

<li>Safety engineering brings chaos and resilience engineering, incident management, and post-mortem processes together for resiliency and reliability</li>
<li>Slack strives to move really fast while being in complete control</li>
<li>Slack is primarily on AWS, but is working on a multi-Cloud strategy because if AWS is down, Slack still needs to work</li>
<li>Slack has a close relationship with AWS and is a collaborative company; it has immediate access to AWS staff anytime there’s a problem</li>
<li>Slack uses Terraform and Chef and working to determine if its production workflows in Kubernetes would be worthwhile</li>
<li>Disasterpiece Theater: Real scenario that might happen and surmise what will happen; don’t cause production issues, but teach Slack employees</li>
<li>Slack hires collaborative, empathetic people to create a collaborative environment where everyone works together toward a goal </li>
<li>Slack was firmly in a centralized operations model, but is transforming toward development teams to increase responsibility and service ownership</li>
<li>Slack doesn’t encourage remote work because it’s not in a position to put in that investment; day-to-day work happens in hallways and between desks</li>
<li>Slack sees itself as an enterprise software company; an enterprise software company must have enterprise software reliability, stability, and processes</li>
<li>Slack has thousands of servers, so events and disruptions happen more often; system needs to respond, react, and repair itself without human intervention</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been doing DevOps for the past 10-20 years, things have really changed in the industry. There’s no longer large pools of help desk support. People aren’t climbing around the data center and learning how to punch down cables and rack servers to gradually work their way up. Now, entry level DevOps jobs require about five years of experience. So, that’s where internships play a major role. But how can an internship program be set up for success? Where is the next generation of SREs or DevOps professionals coming from? Where do we find them?</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Fatema Boxwala, who has been an intern at Rackspace, Yelp, and Facebook. She’s a computer science student at the University of Waterloo in Canada, where she’s involved with the Women in Computer Science Committee and Computer Science Club. Occasionally, she teaches people about Python, Git, and systems administration.  </p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights of the show include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mentors made Fatema’s intern experience positive for her; made site reliability and operations something she wanted to do</li>
<li>Academic paths don’t tend to focus on such fields as SRE, and interns tend to come exclusively from specific schools</li>
<li>Fatema’s school requires five internships to graduate and receive a degree; upper-year students are already very qualified professional software engineers</li>
<li>Companies don’t have time to train and want to find someone with an exact skill set; instead of hiring someone, they spend months with an unfilled position</li>
<li>Continuity Problem: You can’t train someone to be a systems administrator, if you aren’t willing to give them certain privileges due to inexperience</li>
<li>Use a low-stakes environment to train, where mistakes can be made; most systems aren’t on a critical path - don’t keep people away from contributing</li>
<li>If you have never broke production, that means either you’re lying or you’ve been in an environment that didn’t trust you to touch things that mattered</li>
<li>Internship should mimic the kind of work that everyone else is doing; give them responsibilities where their work has an impact</li>
<li>Bad mentors lead to bad internships; person in charge of your success doesn’t have the necessary skills; needs to be a good communicator, set expectations</li>
<li>As the intern, ask about possible outcomes of internship early on; mentors should be clear about expectations, feedback, and offers</li>

<p>Today, we’re talking to Ben Nelson, co-founder and CTO of Lambda School, which is a 30-week online immersive computer science academy. Lambda School has more than 500 students and takes a share of future earnings instead of traditional debt. So, it's free until students get a job.</p>

<li>Bootcamps were created to address engineering shortages and quickly move people into technical careers</li>
<li>Lambda is not explicitly a bootcamp; its 30-week program gives students more instructions and more time spent on developing a portfolio</li>
<li>Lambda also makes time to cover computer science fundamentals; teaches C, Python, Django, and relational database - not just JavaScript</li>
<li>Employers appreciate the school’s in-depth and advanced approach, which results in repeat hires</li>
<li>Lambda avoids the typical reputation of traditional for-profit educational institutions by being mission-driven and knowing its investors want ROI</li>
<li>Lambda aligns its incentives with those of students; an income share agreement means the school doesn’t make money, unless students are successful</li>
<li>Lambda’s 7-month program is less of a risk for someone later in their career; some don't have capital to support their family while going to school for 4 years</li>
<li>Lambda incentivizes healthy financial habits; after two years of repayment, students can put that money into retirement, savings, and investments </li>
<li>5 Tracks Now Offered by Lambda: iOS development, UX, Full Stack Web development, data science, and Android development</li>
<li>Mastery Based Progression System: When you're learning something sequentially, where knowledge builds, you don't move on until you’ve mastered it</li>
<li>Lambda’s acceptance rate is around 5% and based on people who can keep up</li>

Did you have to go through log files or look at a dashboard to figure out what was going on? Did you think there has got to be a better way to troubleshoot and solve problems? </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Sam Bashton, who previously ran a premiere consulting partner with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Recently, he started runbook.cloud, which is a tool built on top of serverless technology that helps people find and troubleshoot problems within their AWS environment. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Trying to figure out if Amazon Web Services (AWS) is right for you? Use the “quadrant of doom” to determine your answer. When designing a Cloud architecture, there are factors to consider. Any system you design exists for one reason - support a business. Think about services and their features to make sure they’re right for your implementation.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Ernesto Marquez, owner and project director at Concurrency Labs. He helps startups launch and grow their applications on AWS. Ernesto especially enjoys building serverless architectures, automating everything, and helping customers cut their AWS costs. </p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon’s level of discipline, process, and willingness to recognize issues and fix them changed the way Ernesto sees how a system should be operated</li>
<li>Specialize on a specific service within AWS, such as S3 and EC2, because there are principles that need to be applied when designing an architecture</li>
<li>Sales and Delivery Cycle: Ernesto has a conversation with a client to discuss their different needs</li>
<li>Vendor Lock-in: Customers concerned about moving application to Cloud provider and how difficult it will be to move code and design variables elsewhere</li>
<li>For every service you include in your architecture, evaluate the service within the context of a particular business case</li>
<li>Identify failure scenarios, what can go wrong, and if something goes wrong, how it’s going to be remediated</li>
<li>CloudWatching detects events that are going to happen, and you can trigger responses for those events </li>
<li>Partnering with Amazon: Companies are pushing a multi-Cloud narrative; you gain visibility and credibility, but it’s not essential to be successful</li>
<li>Can you compete against Amazon? Depends on which area you choose </li>
<li>Expand product selection to grow, focus on user experience, and improve performance to compete against Amazon</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Is your company thinking about adopting serverless and running with it? Is there a profitable opportunity hidden in it? Ready to go on that journey? </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Rowan Udell, who works for Versent, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) consulting partner in Australia. Versent focuses on specific practices, including helping customers with rapid migrations to the Clouds and going serverless.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia is experiencing an increase in developers using serverless tool services and serverless being used for operational purposes</li>
<li>Serverless seems to be either a brilliant fit or not quite ready for prime time</li>
<li>Misconceptions include keeping functions warm, setting up scheduled indications</li>
<li>Simon Wardley talked about how the flow of capital can be traced through an organization that has converted to serverless</li>
<li>Concept of paying thousands of dollars up front for a server is going away</li>
<li>Spend whatever you want, but be able to explain where the money is going (dev vs. prod); companies will re-evaluate how things get done</li>
<li>Serverless is either known as an evolution or revolution; transformative to a point</li>
<li>Winding up with a large number of shops where when something breaks, they don’t have the experience to fix it; gain practical experience through sharing</li>
<li>Seek developer feedback and perform testing, but know where and when to stop</li>
<li>With serverless, you have little control of the environment; focus on automated parts you do control</li>
<li>Serverless Movement: People have opinions and want you to know them</li>
<li>Understand continuum of options for running your application in the Cloud; learn pros and cons; and pick the right tool</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) turned off a customer that it thought was doing something out of bounds. This led to an Internet outrage, and GCP tried to explain itself and prevent the problem in the future. </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Daniel Compton, an independent software consultant who focuses on Clojure and large-scale systems. He’s currently building Deps, a private Maven repository service. As a third-party observer, we pick Daniel’s brain about the GCP issue, especially because he wrote a post called, Google Cloud Platform - The Good, Bad, and Ugly (It’s Mostly Good).</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommendations: Use enterprise billing - costs thousands of dollars; add phone number and extra credit card to Google account; get support contract</li>
<li>Google describing what happened and how it plans to prevent it in the future seemed reasonable; but why did it take this for Google to make changes?</li>
<li>GCP has inherited cultural issues that don’t work in the enterprise market; GCP is painfully learning that they need to change some things</li>
<li>Google tends to focus on writing services aimed purely at developers; it struggles to put itself in the shoes of corporate-enterprise IT shops</li>
<li>GCP has a few key design decisions that set it apart from AWS; focuses on global resources rather than regional resources</li>
<li>When picking a provider, is there a clear winner? AWS or GCP? Consider company’s values, internal capabilities, resources needed, and workload</li>
<li>GCP’s tendency to end service on something people are still using vs. AWS never ending a service tends to push people in one direction</li>
<li>GCP has built a smaller set of services that are easy to get started with, while AWS has an overwhelming number of services</li>
<li>Different Philosophies: Not every developer writes software as if they work at Google; AWS meets customers where they are, fixes issues, and drops prices </li>
<li>GCP understands where it needs to catch up and continues to iterate and release features</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Do you deal with a lot of data? Do you need to analyze and interpret data? Veritone’s platform is designed to ingest audio, video, and other data through batch processes to process the media and attach output, such as transcripts or facial recognition data.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Christopher Stobie, a DevOps professional with more than seven years of experience building and managing applications. Currently, he is the director of site reliability engineering at Veritone in Costa Mesa, Calif. Veritone positions itself as a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) tools designed to help other companies analyze and organize unstructured data. Previously, Christopher was a technical account manager (TAM) at Amazon Web Services (AWS); lead DevOps engineer at Clear Capital; lead DevOps engineer at ESI; Cloud consultant at Credera; and Patriot/THAAD Missile Fire Control in the U.S. Army. Besides staying busy with DevOps and missiles, he enjoys playing racquetball in short shorts and drinking good (not great) wine.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various problems can be solved with AI; companies are spending time and money on AI</li>
<li>Tasks can be automated that are too intelligent to write around simple software</li>
<li>Machine learning (ML) models are applicable for many purposes; real people with real problems and who are not academics can use ML</li>
<li>Fargate is instant-on Docker containers as a service; handles infrastructure scaling, but involves management expense</li>
<li>Instant-on works with numerous containers, but there will probably be a time when it no longer delivers reasonable fleet performance on demand</li>
<li>Decision to use Kafka was based on workload, stream-based ingestion</li>
<li>Veritone’s writes code that tries to avoid provider lock-in; wants to make an integration as decoupled as possible</li>
<li>People spend too much time and energy being agnostic to their technology and giving up benefits</li>
<li>If you dream about seeing your name up in lights, Christopher describes the process of writing a post for AWS </li>
<li>Pain Points: Newness of Fargate and unfamiliarity with it; limit issues; unable to handle large containers</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Google builds platforms for developers and strives to make them happy. There's a team at Google that wakes up every day to make sure developers have great outcomes with its services and products. The team listens to the developers and brings all feedback back into Google. It also spends a lot of time all over the world talking to and connecting with developer communities and showing stuff being worked on. It doesn't do the team any good to build developer products that developers don’t love.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Adam Seligman, vice president of developer relations at Google, where he is responsible for the global developer community across product areas. He is the ears and voice for customers.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>What is serverless? What do people want it to be? Serverless is when you write your software, deploy it to a Cloud vendor that will scale and run it, and you receive a pay-for-use bill. It’s not necessarily a function of a service, but a concept.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Nitzan Shapira, co-founder and CEO of Epsagon, which brings observability to serverless Cloud applications by using distributed tracing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. He is a software engineer with experience in software development, cyber security, reverse engineering, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern renaissance of “functions as a service” compared to past history; is as abstracted as it can be, which means almost no constraints</li>
<li>If you write your own software, ship it, and deploy it - it counts as serverless</li>
<li>Some treat serverless as event-driven architecture where code swings into action</li>
<li>When being strategic to make it more efficient, plan and develop an application with specific and complicated functioning</li>
<li>Epsagon is a global observer for what the industry is doing and how it is implementing serverless as it evolves</li>
<li>Trends and use cases include focusing on serverless first instead of the Cloud</li>
<li>Economic Argument: Less expensive than running things all the time and offers ability to trace capital flow; but be cautious about unpredictable cost   </li>
<li>Use bill to determine how much performance and flow time has been spent</li>
<li>Companies seem to be trying to support every vendor’s serverless offering; when it comes to serverless, AWS Lambda appears to be used most often</li>
<li>Not easy to move from one provider to another; on-premise misses the point</li>
<li>People starting with AWS Lambda need familiarity with other services, which can be a reasonable but difficult barrier that’s worth the effort</li>
<li>Managing serverless applications may have to be done through a third party </li>
<li>Systemic view of how applications work focuses on overall health of a system, not individual function</li>
<li>Epsagon is headquartered in Israel, along with other emerging serverless startups; Israeli culture fuels innovation</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>It is easy to pick apart the general premise of Cloud agnosticism being a myth. What about reasonable use cases? Well, generally, when you have a workload that you want to put on multiple Cloud providers, it is a bad idea. It’s difficult to build and maintain. Providers change, some more than others. The ability to work with them becomes more complex. Yet, Cloud providers rarely disappoint you enough to make you hurry and go to another provider. </p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Jay Gordon, Cloud developer advocate for MongoDB, about databases, distribution of databases, and multi-Cloud strategies. MongoDB is a good option for people who want to build applications quicker and faster but not do a lot of infrastructural work. </p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to consider distributed data to be something reliable and available, than not being reliable and available</li>
<li>People spend time buying an option that doesn’t work, at the cost of feature velocity</li>
<li>If Cloud provider goes down, is it the end of the world?</li>
<li>Cloud offers greater flexibility; but no matter what, there should be a secondary option when a critical path comes to a breaking point</li>
<li>Hand-off from one provider to another is more likely to cause an outage than a multi-region single provider failure</li>
<li>Exclusion of Cloud Agnostic Tooling: The more we create tools that do the same thing regardless of provider, there will be more agnosticism from implementers</li>
<li>Workload-dependent where data gravity dictates choices; bandwidth isn’t free</li>
<li>Certain services are only available on one Cloud due to licensing; but tools can help with migration</li>
<li>Major service providers handle persistent parts of architecture, and other companies offer database services and tools for those providers</li>
<li>Cost may/may not be a factor why businesses stay with 1 instead of multi-Cloud</li>

Workload-dependent where data gravity dictates choices; bandwidth isn’t free
Certain services are only available on one Cloud due to licensing; but tools can help with migration
Major service providers handle persistent parts of architecture, and other companies offer database services and tools for those providers
Cost may/may not be a factor why businesses stay with 1 instead of multi-Cloud
How much RPO and RTO play into a multi-Cloud decision 
Selecting a database/data store when building; consider security encryption

        <![CDATA[<p>Are you about to head off to college? Interested in DevOps and the Cloud? Is there a good way for someone like you who is starting out in the world of technology to absorb the necessary skills? The Open Source Lab (OSL) at Oregon State University (OSU) is one program that helps students and serves as a career accelerator. OSL is a unicorn because OSU is willing to invest in open source.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Lance Albertson, director of OSL at OSU. OSL does a variety of projects to provide private Clouds that are neutrally hosted on its premises. The lab also gives undergraduate students hands-on experience with DevOps skills, including dealing with configuration management, deploying applications, learning how applications deploy, working with projects, and troubleshooting issues. OSL is for any student who has a general interest or passion for it, and a willingness to learn.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow focuses on what students need to learn about Linux and giving access to various repos; then they experience the lab’s configuration management suite</li>
<li>Interview Process: Put out a posting, student submits an application online, each candidate is reviewed, student is given a screening quiz, </li>
<li>If a student passes the screening process, they are brought in for an in-person interview for personality and technical questions</li>
<li>Students tend to initially have the least amount of experience and most difficulty with a repository that has multiple people committing to it and dealing with PRs</li>
<li>Spinning up VMs and understanding how configuration management is connected, how services communicate, and how to set up an application</li>
<li>Round-Robins and System Sprint Meetings: Focus on discussing and documenting processes, issues, suggestions, comments, and other information </li>
<li>Younger students are mentored by Lance and the older students; every generation has to evolve because the environment and industry evolve</li>
<li>OSL made OpenStack work on POWER8, PowerPC, and PowerPC little-endian; gateway into Cloud - having OpenStack instance to offer services</li>
<li>Vast majority of OSL’s revenue comes from donations; no direct support from the university; finding companies to serve as sponsors is beneficial to all</li>
<li>Future of OSL: Providing more Cloud-like services; creating a more internal, private Cloud’ and containerized ways of running or deploying applications</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today, we’re talking to Jeff Barr, vice president and chief evangelist at Amazon Web Services (AWS). He founded the AWS Blog in 2004 and has written more than 2,900 posts for it and another 1,100 for his personal blog. As chief evangelist, Jeff strives to explain the benefits of Cloud computing and Web services to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>Jeff is the voice of AWS. He does what he does best - exploits his superpower of explaining technology in ways that people can understand it. Jeff tries to be the same person all the time. He loves to meet people and go out of his way to say “Hello.” So, if you see him at re:Invent, say “Cheese” and take a selfie with him!</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff uses AWS Workspaces for his blog; one of Jeff’s blogging principles is to not take anybody else's word for anything to the absolute best of his technical ability</li>
<li>Zero Client: Jeff has no rotating hardware, disk drives, just a zero client; wherever he is, it's the same workspace</li>
<li>AWS has something for everyone; it build things in response to customers’ questions, requests, and feedback</li>
<li>Naming Services and Products: Is it helpful? Is it descriptive? Does it have any hidden meanings? </li>
<li>Amazonian DNA and Dog Friendly Workspace: Jeff went from super fearful to accepting, to now thinking of dogs as incredible creations because they add fun and excitement to the office</li>
<li>As part of hiring, each interviewer is assigned Amazon leadership principles (LPs) to ask questions that measure a candidate against those LPs</li>
<li>What is the secret to getting hired at Amazon? Study the LPs to understand what they're about and be able to express your philosophies and history with LPs</li>
<li>re:Invent makes sure customers understand services - What is it? What does it do? How do they put it to work? What are the best use cases for it?</li>
<li>Things can never be too simple; you start from zero, put a lot of different things in there, and then you need the feedback to build in simplicity</li>
<li>AWS is following a more on-demand approach than traditional reserve instances; it opens the door to being used in a lot of ways</li>
<li>AWS does a lot of work before a launch to make sure it’s got infrastructure, scaling, monitoring, and capacity in place</li>
<li>If you are a customer, talk to AWS and let them know what they're doing right or wrong; write a blog post, tweet about it, share it with them in some way</li>
<li>Is the breadth of product offerings from AWS too vast? Is it offering too many things? </li>
<li>AWS was not explicit about where it was going with Cloud computing or do analyses or projections about it; it simply launched SQS and let it speak for itself</li>
<li>Customer feedback shapes what Amazon works on; customers share and then AWS re-prioritizes to make sure it’s delivering the right thing at the right time</li>
<li>Remember: It's not just bits and bytes, it's about the organic life form</li>

      <itunes:summary>Today, we’re talking to Jeff Barr, vice president and chief evangelist at Amazon Web Services (AWS). He founded the AWS Blog in 2004 and has written more than 2,900 posts for it and another 1,100 for his personal blog. As chief evangelist, Jeff strives to explain the benefits of Cloud computing and Web services to anyone who will listen.
Jeff is the voice of AWS. He does what he does best - exploits his superpower of explaining technology in ways that people can understand it. Jeff tries to be the same person all the time. He loves to meet people and go out of his way to say “Hello.” So, if you see him at re:Invent, say “Cheese” and take a selfie with him!
Some of the highlights of the show include:

Jeff uses AWS Workspaces for his blog; one of Jeff’s blogging principles is to not take anybody else's word for anything to the absolute best of his technical ability
Zero Client: Jeff has no rotating hardware, disk drives, just a zero client; wherever he is, it's the same workspace
AWS has something for everyone; it build things in response to customers’ questions, requests, and feedback
Naming Services and Products: Is it helpful? Is it descriptive? Does it have any hidden meanings? 
Amazonian DNA and Dog Friendly Workspace: Jeff went from super fearful to accepting, to now thinking of dogs as incredible creations because they add fun and excitement to the office
As part of hiring, each interviewer is assigned Amazon leadership principles (LPs) to ask questions that measure a candidate against those LPs
What is the secret to getting hired at Amazon? Study the LPs to understand what they're about and be able to express your philosophies and history with LPs
re:Invent makes sure customers understand services - What is it? What does it do? How do they put it to work? What are the best use cases for it?
Things can never be too simple; you start from zero, put a lot of different things in there, and then you need the feedback to build in simplicity
AWS is following a more on-demand approach than traditional reserve instances; it opens the door to being used in a lot of ways
AWS does a lot of work before a launch to make sure it’s got infrastructure, scaling, monitoring, and capacity in place
If you are a customer, talk to AWS and let them know what they're doing right or wrong; write a blog post, tweet about it, share it with them in some way
Is the breadth of product offerings from AWS too vast? Is it offering too many things? 
AWS was not explicit about where it was going with Cloud computing or do analyses or projections about it; it simply launched SQS and let it speak for itself
Customer feedback shapes what Amazon works on; customers share and then AWS re-prioritizes to make sure it’s delivering the right thing at the right time
Remember: It's not just bits and bytes, it's about the organic life form

        <![CDATA[<p>Some companies that offer services expect you to do things their way or take the highway. However, Google expects people to simply adapt the tech company’s suggestions and best practices for their specific context. This is how things are done at Google, but this may not work in your environment.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Liz Fong-Jones, a Senior Staff Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at Google. Liz works on the Google Cloud Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) team and enjoys helping people adapt reliability practices in a way that makes sense for their companies.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liz figures out an appropriate level of reliability for a service and how a service is engineered to meet that target</li>
<li>Staff SRE involves implementation, and then identifying and solving problems</li>
<li>Google’s CRE team makes sure Google Cloud customers can build seamless services on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</li>
<li>Service Level Objectives (SLOs) include error budgets, service level indicators, and key metrics to resolve issues when technology fails</li>
<li>Learn from failures through instant reports and shared post-mortems; be transparent with customers and yourself</li>
<li>GCP: Is it part of Google or not? It’s not a division between old and new.</li>
<li>Perceptions and misunderstandings of how Google does things and how it’s a different environment</li>
<li>Google’s efforts toward customer service and responsiveness to needs</li>
<li>Migrating between different Cloud providers vs. higher level services</li>
<li>How to use Cloud machine learning-based products</li>
<li>GCP needs to focus on usability to maintain a phase of growth</li>
<li>Offer sensible APIs; tear up, turn down, and update in a programmatic fashion</li>
<li>Promotion vs. Different Job: When you’ve learned as much as you can, look for another team to teach something new</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>What’s serverless? Are you serverless now? Is going from enterprise to serverless a natural evolution? Or, is it a “that was fun, now let’s go ride our bikes” moment? Is serverless “just a toy?” Is it a wide and varied ecosystem, or is it Lambda plus some other randos? What's up with serverless vs. containers?</p>
<p>Today, Forrest Brazeal is here to answer those questions and discuss pros and cons of serverless. He was a senior Cloud architect prior to joining Trek10. Forrest spent several years leading AWS and serverless engineering projects at Infor. He understands the challenges faced by enterprises moving to the Cloud and enjoys building solutions that provide maximum business value at a minimal cost. </p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bimodality: Backend development going away and being replaced by managed services; undifferentiated items are being moved to the Cloud</li>
<li>Serverless is application designs with “Backend as a Service” (BaaS) and/or “Functions as a Service” (FaaS) platforms; everything is managed for you</li>
<li>AWS Lambda: Is it today’s trend or a bias that everyone is using it; Lambda makes up 80% of current FaaS adoption</li>
<li>Serverless Ecosystem: You can build it however you want, and you’re doing it right; but don’t take that at face-value; no two Lambda environments are alike</li>
<li>Cloud services at this scale have not been knitted together to form applications that are serving major workloads; best practices need to be established</li>
<li>Native Cloud providers will consolidate, and individual frameworks will be created with components of application stacks tied together to build systems</li>
<li>Serverless vs. Containers: No need for disparity - we can learn to get along; people use containers because it is easier than going serverless</li>
<li>Serverless Heroes series features people thinking out-of-the-box and helps identify emerging trends; serverless is growing, and it’s not just about startups</li>
<li>Went from working with a Sharpie to Procreate for the FaaS and Furious cartoon series; serverless component of process is for invoicing    </li>
<li>Changes? Packaging to handle sharing; more knobs on console; unified process needed because too many building own workflow and tooling</li>
<li>Certification: Proof-positive that you know what you’re talking about or is it questionable value if not backing up expertise in the real world? </li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Are you interested in going beyond basic monitoring and visibility? Need tools to build and operate serverless applications and extract business intelligence? IOpipe provides extended visibility and metrics around AWS Lambda, including profiling, core dumps, and incoming input events.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Erica Windisch, who is the founder and CTO of IOpipe. She brings her experience in building developer and operational tooling to serverless applications.

        <![CDATA[<p>Let’s chat about the Cloud and everything in between. The people in this world are pretty comfortable with not running physical servers on their own, but trusting someone else to run them. Yet, people suffer from the psychological barrier of thinking they need to build, design, and run their own monitoring system. Fortunately, more companies are turning to Datadog.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Ilan Rabinovitch, Datadog’s vice president of product and community. He spends his days diving into container monitoring metrics, collaborating with Datadog’s open source community, and evangelizing observability best practices. Previously, Ilan led infrastructure and reliability engineering teams at various organizations, including Ooyala and Edmunds.com. He’s active in the open source and DevOps communities, where he is a co-organizer of events, such as SCALE and Texas Linux Fest.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Datadog is well-known, especially because it is a frequent sponsor</li>
<li>More organizations know their core competency is not monitoring or managing servers</li>
<li>Monitoring/metrics is a big data problem; Datadog takes monitoring off your plate</li>
<li>Alternate ways, other than using Nagios, to monitor instances and regenerate configurations</li>
<li>Datadog is first to identify patterns when there is a widespread underlying infrastructure issue</li>
<li>Trends of moving from on-premise to Cloud; serverless is on the horizon</li>
<li>How trends affect evolution of Datadog; adjusting tools to monitor customers’ environments</li>
<li>Datadog’s scope is enormous; the company tries to present relevant information as the scale of what it’s watching continues to grow</li>
<li>Datadog’s pricing is straightforward and simple to understand; how much Cloud providers charge to use Datadog is less clear</li>
<li>Single Pane of Glass: Too much data to gather in small areas (dashboards)  </li>
<li>Why didn’t monitoring catch this? Alerts need to be actionable and relevant</li>
<li>How to use Datadog’s workflow for setting alerts and work metrics</li>
<li>Datadog’s first Dash user conference will be held in July in New York; addresses how to solve real business problems, how to scale/speed up your organization</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Does your job challenge and motivate you? Does it utilize your skills? Or, are you ready to go job hunting? Do you want an awesome job that is a resume booster? Companies should be supportive of their employees finding a job that matches their skills and interests. Also, when hiring, companies should offer thoughtful processes for interviews.  </p>
<p>Today, I’m talking to Sarah Withee, a polyglot software engineer, mentor, teacher, and robot tinkerer. Sarah went job hunting, and after several job interviews, she finally found a job that made her super happy at Arcadia Healthcare Solutions. Sarah compares the interview processes she experienced at big name tech companies that offer Cloud services.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies sometimes lose sight that even interview interactions need to be a two-way sale</li>
<li>Interviews often involve talking to many people; and if several are bad, that forms a negative impression of the company </li>
<li>Companies need to provide interview training and follow the same standards </li>
<li>Don’t farm out challenging or unfamiliar issues when interviewing candidates</li>
<li>Sarah is very competent, but she is new to Cloud platforms; she is like a sponge, who enjoys learning and having a bare knowledge of new technology</li>
<li>How HIPAA regulations impact Sarah’s learning and software engineering work; she has to be more aware of security and safety of healthcare data</li>
<li>Being a teacher and mentor affects how Sarah learns new things; everybody learns slightly differently</li>

      <itunes:summary>Docker went from being a small startup to an enterprise company that changed the way people think about their infrastructure to now, where its relevance is somewhat minimal. The conversation is no longer around the container level. Docker has become commonplace.
Today, we’re talking to Jérôme Petazzoni, formerly of Docker. While he was with the company for about 8 years, Docker definitely experienced a roller coaster ride.  
Some of the highlights of the show include:

Amount of work conducted on the enterprise vs. community editions
Docker was so widely adopted because its core technology was open source 
Challenge is to build a viable business and revenue model for the long run
Similarities between Docker and Red Hat open source platforms 
Docker went from six people working in a garage to having a few hundred employees and $1.3 billion valuation
Changes happened, but they were gradual; the changes were necessary to be a profitable and sustainable company
Contingent of internal and external people believed that Docker was the answer for whatever problem surfaced; Docker would save you, but not always
Balancing Act: Pushing forward with a correct message and regulating enthusiasm 
Networking and Docker for dummies; confusion and problems of things not working as expected have been resolved
Things will continue to shift; Kubernetes and the orchestration battle
What was unthinkable, could happen by companies pushing the envelope and making progress
Will who you have as your Cloud provider stop mattering? It depends.
All major Cloud providers plan to offer managed Kubernetes services and what Jérôme thinks of them
Jérôme’s opinion on whether Kubernetes will follow this same path as Docker
What does the road ahead look like for infrastructure automation? There is potential and lots of best practices in Cloud environments.

        <![CDATA[<p>Like migrating caribou, you tend to follow the trends of what clients are doing, which dictates what you work on as a consultant.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Lynn Langit, an independent Cloud architect. She is an AWS Community Hero, Google Cloud developer expert, and former Microsoft MVP. Lynn is a lifelong learner, and she has worked broad and deep across all three large providers.

<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differences between the West Coast and global use of Cloud</li>
<li>Education is key; Lynn is th co-founder of Teachingkidsprogramming.org</li>
<li>Lynn helped create curriculum and resources for school-age children; even her young daughter taught classes on how to code</li>
<li>Training for teachers was also needed, so TKP Labs was formed to offer fee-based teacher and developer training</li>
<li>Lynn started with classroom training, but has transitioned to online learning </li>
<li>Lynn is focusing on Big Data projects and using tools to solve real-world problems</li>
<li>Pre-processing and batching data, but not streaming it </li>
<li>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are all coming out with Big Data-oriented tools</li>
<li>Companies need to understand when the market is ready to accept a new paradigm; in the data world, change is more slow than in the programming world</li>

<li>Machine learning APIs give customers value quickly; review them before building custom models</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has experienced a renaissance. By everything that we've seen coming out of Microsoft over the past few years, it feels like the company is really walking the walk. Instead of just talking about how it’s innovative, it’s demonstrating that. Microsoft has been on an amazing journey, making the progression from telling customers what they need to listening to them and responding by building what they ask for.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Corey Sanders, Corporate Vice President of Azure Compute at Microsoft. </p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers are asking for Microsoft to help them through support and enabling platforms</li>
<li>Storytelling efforts through advocates, who play a double role – engaging and defending Microsoft</li>
<li>Customers moving to the Cloud are focused on a continuum and progression; they have stuff to move from one location to another and want all the benefits–better agility, faster startup time, etc.</li>
<li>Virtual serial console into existing VMs; this is how people are using this and Microsoft is going to, if not encourage this behavior, at least support it</li>
<li>Microsoft is the only Cloud with a single-instance SLA</li>
<li>Serial consoles: Windows' has seen less usage, partly due to operational aspects of Windows vs. Linux. It's not a GUI; it's scripting.</li>
<li>Does the operating system matter? From a Cloud perspective, it shouldn't have to matter; you should be able to deploy it the way you want</li>
<li>Edge enables much more complex and segregated scenarios; that combination with cognitive searches running locally will make it accessible anywhere</li>
<li>Branding challenge as customers start to notice that devices are smarter and more complex; will they lose awareness that Microsoft Azure is powering most of these things - they shouldn’t care</li>
<li>An awareness of not just what's possible, but what's coming; the democratization of AI</li>
<li>Education and fear gap of trying something new and taking that first step; make products and services stupid and simple to use</li>
<li>Customers return to add cognitive services and AI capabilities to existing, running deployments, environments, and applications</li>
<li>Multi-Cloud solutions can be successful, but there's a caveat; they’re actually built on a service-by-service perspective</li>
<li>Azure Stack, offers consistency, but some people may place blame on it for poor data center management practices; some expectations and regulations may be frustrating to some customers, but lets Microsoft offer a consistent experience</li>
<li>Freedom and flexibility have been challenges for Microsoft and other products for private Clouds </li>
<li>What people need to understand about Azure, including from a durability and reliability experience</li>
<li>To some extent, scale becomes a necessary prerequisite for some applications</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you dabbled with IT infrastructure in AWS? Have you been through the process of AWS partnership? Does being an AWS partner add value? Amazon seeks partners that helps drive its business, goals, and value.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Justin Brodley, the vice president of Cloud engineering at Ellie Mae. He has been through the AWS partnership process and shares his thoughts about it. He encourages you to find the right partner for your business!</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different levels and types of AWS partnerships</li>
<li>Shakedown vs. opportunity method for new leads; lead generation expectations</li>
<li>Amazon’s improvements eroding business models</li>
<li>Partners trying to pivot, but not exclusive to AWS</li>
<li>Whether to invest in multi-Cloud</li>
<li>Amazon can’t scale its sales team to handle everybody; views partner program as an extension of its salesforce</li>
<li>Your company is important and you’re spending a lot of money, but Amazon may not care about you; partner market fills that gap and makes you feel important</li>
<li>Corporate prisoner’s dilemma: Your tech company offers something that Amazon doesn’t; but what about when Amazon does offer it?</li>
<li>Competitors’ horizontal move to become more diversified</li>
<li>Amazon expects partners to offer products and services that it cannot offer yet</li>
<li>If partners fail, Amazon decides to do it and do it better</li>
<li>Is Amazon’s best interest geared toward its partners or you and your customers?</li>
<li>Amazon needs to give incentives and support partners</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>How are companies evolving in a world where Cloud is on the rise? Where Cloud providers are bought out and absorbed into other companies?</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Nell Shamrell-Harrington about Cloud infrastructure. She is a senior software engineer at Chef, CTO at Operation Code, and core maintainer of the the Habitat open source product. Nell has traveled the world to talk about Chef, Ruby, Rails, Rust, DevOps, and Regular Expressions. </p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chef is a configuration management tool that handles instance, files, virtual machine container, and other items. </li>
<li>Immutable infrastructure has emerged as the best of practice approach. </li>
<li>Chef is moving into next gen through various projects, including one called, Compliance - a scanning tool.</li>
<li>Some people don’t trust virtualization. </li>
<li>Habitat is an open source project featuring software that allows you to use a universal packaging format. </li>
<li>Habitat is a run-time, so when you run a package on multiple virtual machines, they form a supervisor ring to communicate via leader/follower roles. </li>
<li>Deploying an application depends on several factors, including application and infrastructure needs. </li>
<li>It is possible to convert old systems with old deployment models to Habitat. </li>
<li>Habitat allows you to lift a legacy application and put it into that modern infrastructure without needing to rewrite the application.</li>
<li>You can ease in packages to Habitat, and then have Habitat manage pieces of the application.</li>
<li>Habitat is Cloud-agnostic and integrates with public and private Cloud providers by exporting an application as a container. </li>
<li>Chef is one of just a few third-party offerings marketed directly by AWS.</li>
<li>From inception to deployment, there is a place for large Cloud providers to parlay into language they already speak. </li>
<li>Operation Code is a non-profit that teaches software engineer skills to veterans. It helps veterans transition into high-paying engineering jobs.</li>
<li>The technology landscape is ever changing. What skills are most marketable?  </li>
<li>Operation Code is a learning by experience type of organization and usually starts people on the front-end to immediately see results.</li>

        <![CDATA[<p>How do you encourage businesses to pick Google Cloud over Amazon and other providers? How do you advocate for selecting Google Cloud to be successful on that platform? Google Cloud is not just a toy with fun features, but is a a capable Cloud service.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Seth Vargo, a Senior Staff Developer Advocate at Google. Previously, he worked at HashiCorp in a similar advocacy role and worked very closely with Terraform, Vault, Consul, Nomad, and other tools. He left HashiCorp to join Google Cloud and talk about those tools and his experiences with Chef and Puppet, as well as communities surrounding them. He wants to share with you how to use these tools to integrate with Google Cloud and help drive product direction.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengths related to Google Cloud include its billing aspect. You can work on Cloud bills and terminate all billable resources. The button you click in the user interface to disable billing across an entire project and delete all billable resources has an API. You can build a chat bot or script, too. It presents anything you’ve done in the Consul by clicking and pointing, as well as gives you what that looks like in code form. </li>
<li>You can expose that from other people’s accounts because turning off someone else’s Website as a service can be beneficial. You can invite anyone with a Google account, not just ‘@gmail.com’ but ‘@’ any domain and give them admin or editor permissions across a project. They’re effectively part of your organization within the scope of that project. For example, this feature is useful for training or if a consultant needs to see all of your different clients in one dashboard, but your clients can’t see each other.</li>
<li>Google is a household name. However, it’s important to recognize that advocacy is not just external advocacy, there’s an internal component to it. There’s many parts of Google and many features of Google Cloud that people aren’t aware of. As an advocate, Seth’s job is to help people win. </li>
<li>Besides showing people how they can be successful on Google Cloud, Seth focuses on strategic complaining. He is deeply ingrained in several DevOps and configuration management communities, which provide him with positive and negative feedback. It’s his job to take that feedback and convert it into meaningful action items for product teams to prioritize and put on roadmaps. Then, the voice of the communities are echoed in the features and products being internally developed.</li>
<li>Amazon has been in the Cloud business for a long time. What took Google so long? For a long time, Google was perceived as being late to the party and not able to offer as comprehensive and experienced services as Amazon. Now, people view Google Cloud as not being substandard, but not where serious business happens. It’s a fully feature platform and it comes down to preferences and pre-existing features, not capability.</li>
<li>Small and mid-size companies typically pick a Cloud provider and stick with their choice. Larger companies and enterprises, such as Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 companies, pick multiple Clouds. This is usually due to some type of legal compliance issues, or there are Cloud providers that have specific features. </li>
<li>Externally at Google, there is the Deployment Manager tool at cloud.google.com. It’s the equivalent of CloudFormation, and teams at Google are staffed full time to perform engineering work on it. Every API that you get by clicking a button on cloud.google.com are viewing the API Docs accessible via the Deployment Manager. </li>
<li>Google Cloud also partners with open source tools and corresponding companies. There are people at Google who are paid by Google who work full time on open source tools, like Terraform, Chef, and Puppet. This allows you to provision Google Cloud resources using the tools that you prefer. </li>
<li>According to Seth, there’s five key pillars of DevOps: 1) Reduce organizational silos and break down barriers between teams; 2) Accept failures; 3) Implement gradual change; 4) Tooling and automation; and 5) Measure everything.</li>
<li>Think of DevOps as an interface in programming language, like Java, or a type of language where it doesn’t actually define what you do, but gives you a high level of what the function is supposed to implement.</li>
<li>With the SRE discipline, there’s a prescribed way for performing those five pillars of DevOps. Specific tools and technologies used within Google, some of which are exposed publicly as part of Google Cloud, enable the kind of DevOps culture and DevOps mindset that occur. </li>
<li>A reason why Google offers abstract classes in programming is that there’s more than one way to solve a problem, and SRE is just one of those ways. It’s the way that has worked best for Google, and it has worked best for a number of customers that Google is working with. But there are some other ways, too. Google supports those ways and recognizes that there isn’t just one path to operational success, but many ways to reach that prosperity.</li>
<li>The book, <em>Site Reliability Engineering</em>, describes how Google does SRE, which tried to be evangelized with the world because it can help people improve  operations. The flip side of that is that organizations need to be cognizant of their own requirements. </li>
<li>Google has always held up along several other companies as a shining beacon of how infrastructure management could be. But some say there’s still problems with its infrastructure, even after 20-some years and billions invested. </li>
<li>Every company has problems, some of them technical, some cultural. Google is no exception. The one key difference is the way Google handles issues from a cultural perspective. It focuses on fixing the problem and making sure it doesn’t happen again. There’s a very blameless culture. </li>
<li>Conferences tend to include a lot of hand waving and storytelling. But as an industry, more war stories need to be told instead of pleasure stories. Conference organizers want to see sunshine and rainbows because that sells tickets and makes people happy. The systemic problem is how to talk about problems out in the open.</li>
<li>Becoming frustrated and trying to figure out why computers do certain things is a key component of the SRE discipline referred to as Toil -  work tied to systems that either we don’t understand or don’t make sense to automate. </li>
<li>Those going to Google Cloud to ‘move and improve’ tend to be a mix of those from other Cloud providers and those from...</li></ul>]]>

You can invite anyone with a Google account, not just ‘@gmail.com’ but ‘@’ any domain and give them admin or editor permissions across a project. They’re effectively part of your organization within the scope of that project. For example, this feature is useful for training or if a consultant needs to see all of your different clients in one dashboard, but your clients can’t see each other.
Google is a household name. However, it’s important to recognize that advocacy is not just external advocacy, there’s an internal component to it. There’s many parts of Google and many features of Google Cloud that people aren’t aware of. As an advocate, Seth’s job is to help people win. 
Besides showing people how they can be successful on Google Cloud, Seth focuses on strategic complaining. He is deeply ingrained in several DevOps and configuration management communities, which provide him with positive and negative feedback. It’s his job to take that feedback and convert it into meaningful action items for product teams to prioritize and put on roadmaps. Then, the voice of the communities are echoed in the features and products being internally developed.
Amazon has been in the Cloud business for a long time. What took Google so long? For a long time, Google was perceived as being late to the party and not able to offer as comprehensive and experienced services as Amazon. Now, people view Google Cloud as not being substandard, but not where serious business happens. It’s a fully feature platform and it comes down to preferences and pre-existing features, not capability.
Small and mid-size companies typically pick a Cloud provider and stick with their choice. Larger companies and enterprises, such as Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 companies, pick multiple Clouds. This is usually due to some type of legal compliance issues, or there are Cloud providers that have specific features. 
Externally at Google, there is the Deployment Manager tool at cloud.google.com. It’s the equivalent of CloudFormation, and teams at Google are staffed full time to perform engineering work on it. Every API that you get by clicking a button on cloud.google.com are viewing the API Docs accessible via the Deployment Manager. 
Google Cloud also partners with open source tools and corresponding companies. There are people at Google who are paid by Google who work full time on open source tools, like Terraform, Chef, and Puppet. This allows you to provision Google Cloud resources using the tools that you prefer. 
According to Seth, there’s five key pillars of DevOps: 1) Reduce organizational silos and break down barriers between teams; 2) Accept failures; 3) Implement gradual change; 4) Tooling and automation; and 5) Measure everything.
Think of DevOps as an interface in programming language, like Java, or a type of language where it doesn’t actually define what you do, but gives you a high level of what the function is supposed to implement.
With the SRE discipline, there’s a prescribed way for performing those five pillars of DevOps. Specific tools and technologies used within Google, some of which are exposed publicly as part of Google Cloud, enable the kind of DevOps culture and DevOps mindset that occur. 
A reason why Google offers abstract classes in programming is that there’s more than one way to solve a problem, and SRE is just one of those ways. It’s the way that has worked best for Google, and it has worked best for a number of customers that Google is working with. But there are some other ways, too. Google supports those ways and recognizes that there isn’t just one path to operational success, but many ways to reach that p...</itunes:summary>
      <itunes:subtitle>How do you encourage businesses to pick Google Cloud over Amazon and other providers? How do you advocate for selecting Google Cloud to be successful on that platform? Google Cloud is not just a toy with fun features, but is a a capable Cloud service.

        <![CDATA[<p>When companies migrate to the Cloud, they are literally changing how they do everything in their IT department. If lots of customers exclusively rely on a service, like us-east-1, then they are directly impacted by outages. There is safety in a herd and in numbers because everybody sits there, down and out. But, you don’t engineer your application to be a little more less than a single point of failure. It’s a bad idea to use a sole backing service for something, and it’s unacceptable from a business perspective.</p>
<p>Today, we’re talking to Chris Short from the Cloud and DevOps space. Recently, he was recognized for his DevOps’ish newsletter and won the Opensource.com People’s Choice Award for his DevOps writing. He’s been blogging for years and writing about things that he does every day, such as tutorials, codes, and methods. Now, Chris, along with Jason Hibbets, run the DevOps team for Opensource.com</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the show include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris’ writing makes difficult topics understandable. He is frank and provides broad information. However, he admits when he is not sure about something.</li>
<li>SJ Technologies aims to help companies embrace a DevOps philosophy, while adapting their operations to a Cloud-native world. Companies want to take advantage of philosophies and tooling around being Cloud native.</li>
<li>Many companies consider a Cloud migration because they’ve got data centers across the globe. It’s active-passive backup with two data centers that are treated differently and cannot switch to easily.</li>
<li>Some companies do a Cloud migration to refactor and save money. A Cloud migration can result in you having to shove your SAN into the USC1. It can become a hybrid workflow.</li>
<li>Lift and shift is often considered the first legitimate step toward moving to the Cloud. However, know as much as you can about your applications and RAM and CPU allowances. Look at density when you’re lifting and shifting.</li>
<li>Know how your applications work and work together. Simplify a migration by knowing what size and instances to use and what monitoring to have in place.</li>
<li>Some do not support being on the Cloud due to a lack of understanding of business practices and how they are applied. But, most are no longer skeptical about moving to the Cloud. Now, instead of ‘why cloud,’ it becomes ‘why not.’</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don’t jump without looking. Planning phases are important, but there will be unknowns that you will have to face.</li>
<li>Downtime does cost money. Customers will go to other sites. They can find what they want and need somewhere else. There’s no longer a sole source of anything.</li>
<li>The DevOps journey is never finished, and you’re never done migrating. Embrace changes yourself to help organizations change.</li>

      <itunes:summary>This podcast features people doing interesting work in the world of Cloud. What is the state of the technical world? Let’s first focus on the up or down, on or off function of feature flags.
Today, we’re talking to Heidi Waterhouse, a technical writer turned Developer Advocate at LaunchDarkly, which is a feature flag service - a way to wrap a snippet of code around your feature and make it into an instrument to turn on or off. It lets you turn things on and off in your codebase quickly without having to do several commits. However, it is difficult to track it when there are more than about a dozen flags. So, LaunchDarkly provides a way to manage your features at scale with a usable interface and API.
Some of the highlights of the show include:

A feature flag allows you to hide items before you want them to go live on your Website. You hide it behind a feature flag, doing all the work ahead of time. Then, at some point, you turn it all on instantly without the risk of pushing untested code into your production.
You can test at scale to gain authentic data. Test something with your team, your company’s employees, your customers, etc. However, no matter how good your integration tests are, there’s always wobbles to watch for in the system.
With implementation, there are a few paths that can work, such as the massive reorganization path. Or, you can just start incrementally with feature flags for new features.
LaunchDarkly thinks in the Cloud as the surface because it mostly works with people who are doing Web-based delivery of features.


Major companies, like Google and Facebook, offer services similar to feature flags for their own development. They’re operating on such a giant scale that they have internal teams doing it.
Companies use feature flags on the front-end and other purposes. It works through the whole stack from frontend page delivery, pricing tiers, white labeling, style sheets, to safer deployments.
Do not focus on documentation. You should not have to read documentation for anything that you don’t own. Every feature should have documentation tied to its code. Create a customized experience.
Feature flags effectively manage and minimize risk. There is always risk in the world, but what causes disaster is not just one failure. It is a multiplication of failures. This goes wrong and that goes wrong. Feature flagging breaks monolithic releases into tiny chunks that can go forward or backward.
LaunchDarkly holds monthly meet-ups called, Test and Production. People share their use case regarding continuous integration, continuous deployment, DevOps, etc.

Quotes by Heidi:
“What feature flags do is make it possible for you to push out a deployment with things hidden, we call it launching darkly.”
“We’re all about avoiding risk, I think this is our motto this year, eliminate risk…you can’t eliminate risk, but you can make it much less risky.”
“Go ahead and write your feature. You know that it’s hidden behind the magical feature flying curtain until you’re ready to turn it on.”
 “If 20 years of technical writing taught me anything, it’s that nobody wants to be reading documentation.”
