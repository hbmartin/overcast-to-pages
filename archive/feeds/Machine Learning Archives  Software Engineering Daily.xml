										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Java is one of the most widely used programming languages, and a key contributor to its success is VMware Tanzu’s Spring, the most common framework for Java development. The Spring Framework is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine and provides a consistent programming and configuration model for application developers. From inception, it was designed with developer experience and modularity in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The open-source application framework has been accelerating Java development times since its inception in 2004 (Happy 20th birthday). Since then, the platform has been expanding: growing 50% year over year during the last five years. In this blog we’re exploring what makes Spring important to Java, how the framework influenced the developer experience, and a look at the latest version of Spring, which introduces features to support AI integration.</p>
<h2>Spring Success</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, there were dozens of different ways to connect to a database, something just about every application has to do at some point. “At the time, the various approaches were very cumbersome: developers wrote a lot of code and gained very little functionality,” explained Mark Pollack, a Senior Staff Engineer, Tanzu Division, Broadcom. “Spring provided a lot of value by simplifying the process. Just getting a single app to talk to a database, present a web form, and do transactions correctly was a huge win. In that era, developers could spend weeks trying to create that function.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another reason for its success is its enterprise-focus. Most open source projects concentrate on the consumer market. However, large companies invest a lot of money building applications to run their businesses. “At the end of the day, large corporations’ largest expense is probably their developers,” explained Ryan Morgan, Senior Director of Engineering, Tanzu Division, Broadcom. Spring makes developer teams more efficient, which greatly enhances the bottom line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the years, the ecosystem has grown. “There’s a large and vibrant community behind Spring,” noted Tanzu’s Morgan. Now, it has more than 200 different technology starters. These software building blocks make it simpler for software engineers to integrate their code with different third-party systems.</p>
<h2>Get a Great Start</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Development problems evolve over time, so various elements were added. Spring Initializer is a bootstrapping tool, a way for developers to create a new project. “Normally, software engineers started from a blank piece of paper and had to figure out what type of project it was and what type of libraries were needed,” said Tanzu’s Morgan. Then, they searched the web to find some place in the documentation that told them what library dependency was needed to add for different pieces of functionality. Then invariably, you cut and pasted from something that wasn&#8217;t consistent. You ended up with a mess.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Spring Initializer, software engineers go to a website which has clear instructions about what the options are and presents them in a typical web form. Then, they enter the Generate command and out comes a shell that they can use to start building their program. The solution does not generate any code but solves the problem of finding the right application dependencies. Developers start faster and are less frustrated than previous methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under development is Spring CLI, which not only creates the shell of the app but also includes code. The advances have a significant impact because 1 million new projects are created each month.</p>
<h2>Meet the Need for Development Speed</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last 10 years have seen a major move to container deployment and Spring has aligned with this paradigm shift. “Really, when you think about all those cloud native patterns, a lot of those container functions are really baked into our projects already,” stated Tanzu’s Morgan. “If you want to do distributed configuration, we have a solution for that. You want to do service discovery; Spring has patterns and tools for that.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, a major change to Spring occurred. Rather than release new functions autonomously, they are gathered and bundled into Spring Boot. Version 3.0, which is based on Spring Framework 6.0, requires Java 17 or above. Previously, Spring supported Java 8, so the change is significant for some companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Better performance is one benefit from the change. “We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/how-netflix-increased-application-performance-with-spring-boot-3-and-java-17">customers</a> realize 15% performance improvements, just from doing the upgrade,” said Tanzu’s Morgan.</p>
<h2>Java Supports Generative AI</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI is being woven into many applications, especially with the emergence of Generative AI solutions. They represent a quantum leap in capabilities and overall intelligence compared to previous iterations of AI. One reason why today’s generative models are gaining so much attention is that they work with much larger volumes of information (hundreds of billions of words) and larger data models (hundreds of billions of parameters) compared to previous AI systems. They possess impressive and unprecedented power. Consequently, they can perform very sophisticated functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However as developers try to take advantage of the functionality, platform diversity again presents development challenges. “OpenAI has their API, Amazon Bedrock offers a different one, and so do other companies,” noted Tanzu’s Pollack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A guiding focus and design principle in the Spring framework is simplifying such work by providing common abstractions over similar technologies and interfaces. Spring AI is quickly becoming the starting point when Java developers write AI applications. “Spring AI has the common patterns that Spring developers are used to,” noted Tanzu’s Pollack. It can abstract out models, clients, etc. in ways that are familiar to Spring users.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another crucial part of AI applications is using a vector database. Spring supports multiple vector databases, and its portable API simplifies changing implementations. So, Spring streamlines AI application development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Java has been a popular programming language for enterprises for decades. Spring provides software engineers with tools that help them enhance the development process. The framework has reached its 20th year of empowering developers, and its years, engaged community is laying the groundwork for continued expansion in the coming decades. “Maybe one reason why Spring continues to do well is it constantly tries to improve itself and doesn&#8217;t just rest on its laurels,” concluded Tanzu’s Pollack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">On a recent trip to my hometown in Eastern Canada, my father picked me up at the airport. One of the first things he asked me was, “Is AI going to take everyone’s jobs?”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When AI, generative AI, and large language models (LLM) have become topics of conversation within the senior citizen community of rural Canada, you know it’s on <em>everyone’s</em> minds. Generative AI, and especially the use of LLMs, is the “<a href="https://www.michaellewiswrites.com/index.html#the-new-new-thing">new new thing</a>”. It dominates my X (i.e. Twitter) feed and nearly every conversation I have about technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s justifiably a ton of excitement about the power of generative AI, reminiscent of the introduction of the Internet or the first smartphone. Generative AI is poised to transform how we build products, design drugs, write content, and interact with technology. But as the utilization of AI grows, many governments and companies have raised concerns about the privacy and compliance issues that adopters of these technologies face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The core challenge posed by generative AI right now is that unlike conventional applications, LLMs have no “delete” button. There’s no straightforward mechanism to “unlearn” specific information, no equivalent to deleting a row in your database’s <strong>user</strong> table. In a world where the “right to be forgotten” is central to many privacy regulations, using LLMs presents some difficult challenges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what does all this mean for businesses that are building new AI-powered applications or AI models?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this post, we’ll explore this question and attempt to provide answers. We’ll examine the potential impact of generative AI, ongoing compliance hurdles, and a variety of privacy strategies. Finally, we’ll examine a novel approach grounded in the <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2022/10/09903879/1H0G8Iq3qDu">IEEE&#8217;s recommended architecture</a> for securely storing, managing, and utilizing sensitive customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information)—the data privacy vault.</p>
<h2 id="h2-e2f1bb9792f20">Generative AI’s privacy and compliance challenges</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine the following scenario: You&#8217;ve just copied and pasted sensitive contract details into an LLM to get some quick assistance with routine contract due diligence. The LLM serves its purpose, but here&#8217;s the catch: depending on how it&#8217;s configured, that confidential contract data might linger within the LLM, accessible to other users. Deleting it isn&#8217;t an option, predicting its future use—or misuse—becomes a daunting task, and retraining the LLM to “roll it back” to its state before you shared those sensitive contract details can be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only foolproof solution?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep sensitive data far away from LLMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sensitive information, including internal company project names, core intellectual property, or personal data like birthdates, social security numbers, and healthcare records, can inadvertently find its way into LLMs in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Training data</strong>: LLMs are trained and honed on expansive datasets that often contain PII. Without robust anonymization or redaction measures in place, sensitive data becomes part of the model&#8217;s training dataset, meaning that this data can potentially resurface later.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inference</strong>: LLMs generate text based on user inputs or prompts. Much like training data, a prompt containing sensitive data seeps into the model and can influence the generated content, potentially exposing this data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h3-178f0f3dee860">Privacy laws</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI data privacy is a formidable challenge for any company interested in investing in generative AI technology. Recent temporary bans of ChatGPT in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406">Italy</a> and by companies like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-chatbots-for-employees-after-sensitive-code-leak/">Samsung</a> have pushed these concerns to the forefront for businesses looking to invest in generative AI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even outside of generative AI, there are increasing concerns about protecting data privacy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/business/meta-facebook-eu-privacy-fine.html">Meta was recently fined </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/business/meta-facebook-eu-privacy-fine.html">$</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/business/meta-facebook-eu-privacy-fine.html">1.3 billion</a> by the European Union (EU) for its non-compliant transfers of sensitive data to the U.S. And this isn’t just an issue for companies doing business in the EU.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are now more than 100 countries with some form of privacy regulation in place. Each country’s privacy regulations include unique and nuanced requirements that place a variety of restrictions on the use and handling of sensitive data. The most common restrictions relate to cross-border data transfers, where sensitive data can be stored, and to individual data subject rights such as the “right to be forgotten.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest shortcomings of LLMs is their inability to selectively delete or &#8220;unlearn&#8221; specific data points, such as an individual&#8217;s name or date of birth. This limitation presents significant risks for businesses leveraging these systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, privacy regulations in Europe, Argentina, and the Philippines (just to name a few) all support an individual’s “right to be forgotten.” This grants individuals the right to have their personal information removed or erased from a system. Without an LLM delete button, there’s no way for a business to address such a request without retraining their LLM from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consider the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which grants individuals the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data—a task that becomes daunting if that data is embedded within an LLM. GDPR also empowers individuals with the right to object to automated decision-making, further complicating compliance for companies that use LLMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data localization requirements pose another challenge for users of LLMs. These requirements pertain to the physical location where customer data is stored. Different countries and regions have precise laws dictating how customer data should be handled, processed, stored, and safeguarded. This poses a significant challenge when using an LLM used for a company’s global customer base.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) under GDPR and other laws add another layer of complexity. In the EU and California, individuals (i.e., “data subjects”) have the right to request access to their personal data, but complying with such requests proves challenging if that data has been processed by LLMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the intricate privacy and compliance landscape and the complexity of LLMs, the most practical approach to maintaining compliance is to prevent sensitive data from entering the model altogether. By implementing stringent data handling practices, businesses can mitigate the privacy risks associated with LLMs, while also maintaining the utility of the model. Many companies have already decided that the risks are too high, so they’ve banned the use of ChatGPT, but this approach is shortsighted. Properly managed, these models can create a lot of value.</p>
<h2 id="h2-f20f8240ce180">Privacy approaches for generative AI</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To address the privacy challenges associated with generative AI models, there have been a few proposals such as banning or controlling access, using <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/17/synthetic-data-big-data-fewer-privacy-risks/">synthetic data</a> instead of real data, and running private LLMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Banning ChatGPT and other generative AI systems isn’t an effective long-term strategy, and these other “band aid” approaches are bound to fail as people can find easy workarounds. Using synthetic data replaces sensitive information with similar-looking but non-sensitive data and keeps PII out of the model, but at the cost of losing the value that motivated you to share sensitive data with the LLM in the first place. The model loses context, and there’s no referential integrity between the synthetically generated data and the original sensitive information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most popular approach to addressing AI data privacy, and the one that’s being promoted by cloud providers like Google, Microsoft, AWS, and Snowflake, is to run your LLM privately on their infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, with Snowflake’s Snowpark Model Registry, you can take an open source LLM and run it within a container service in your Snowflake account. They <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/container-services-llama2-snowpark-ml/">state</a> that this allows you to train the LLM using your proprietary data.</p>

<figure class="my48"><figcaption class="ta-center fs-body2 fc-black-500 mb0"><em>Snowpark Model Registry and Container Service (Source: Snowflake Blog)</em></figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, there are several drawbacks to using this approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of privacy concerns, if you’re choosing to run an LLM privately rather than take advantage of an existing managed service, then you’re stuck with managing the updates, and possibly the infrastructure, yourself. It’s also going to be much more expensive to run an LLM privately. Taken together, these drawbacks mean running a private LLM likely doesn’t make sense for most companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the bigger issue is that, from a privacy standpoint, private LLMs simply don’t provide effective data privacy. Private LLMs give you model isolation, but they don’t provide data governance in the form of fine-grained access controls: any user who can access the private LLM can access all of the data that it contains. Data privacy is about giving a user control over their data, but private LLMs still suffer from all of the intrinsic limitations around data deletion that are blocking the adoption of public LLMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What matters to a business—and individual data subjects—is who sees what, when, where, and for how long. Using a private LLM doesn’t give you the ability to make sure that Susie in accounting sees one type of LLM response based on her job title while Bob in customer support sees something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how can we prevent PII and other sensitive data from entering an LLM, but also support data governance so we can control who can see what and support the need to delete sensitive data?</p>
<h2 id="h2-b6d3af29a8d50">A new approach to PII management</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the world of traditional data management, an increasingly popular approach to protecting the privacy of sensitive data is through the use of a data privacy vault. A data privacy vault isolates, protects, and governs sensitive customer data while facilitating region-specific compliance with laws like GDPR through data localization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a vault architecture, sensitive data is stored in your vault, isolated outside of your existing systems. Isolation helps ensure the integrity and security of sensitive data, and simplifies the regionalization of this data. De-identified data that serve as references to the sensitive data are stored in traditional cloud storage and downstream services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">De-identification happens through a tokenization process. This is not the same as LLM tokenization, that has to do with splitting texts into smaller units. With data de-identification, tokenization is a non-algorithmic approach to data obfuscation that swaps sensitive data for tokens. A token is a pointer that lets you reference something somewhere else while providing obfuscation.Traditional data management versus a data privacy vault architec</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s look at a simple example. In the workflow below a phone number is collected by a front end application. The phone number, along with any other PII, is stored securely in the vault, which is isolated outside of your company’s existing infrastructure. In exchange, the vault generates a de-identified representation of the phone number (e.g. ABC123). The de-identified (or tokenized) data has no mathematical connection with the original data, so it can’t be reverse engineered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any downstream services—application databases, data warehouse, analytics, any logs, etc.—store only a token representation of the data, and are removed from the scope of compliance:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, a data privacy vault can store sensitive data in a specific geographic location, and tightly control access to this data. Other systems, including LLMs, only have access to non-sensitive de-identified data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vault not only stores and generates de-identified data, but it tightly controls access to sensitive data through a zero trust model where no user account or process has access to data unless it’s granted by explicit access control policies. These policies are built from the bottom, granting access to specific columns and rows of PII. This allows you to control who sees what, when, where, for how long, and in what format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, let’s say we have a vault containing customer records with columns defined for a customer’s name, social security number (SSN), date of birth (DOB), and email. In our application we want to support two types of users: support and marketing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Support doesn’t need to know the exact details about a customer, they only need masked data so they can speak to the customer by name and verify their identity using the last four digits of the customer’s SSN. We can create a policy for the role support that grants access to only the limited view of the data.</p>
<pre class="s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-delphi">ALLOW <span class="hljs-keyword">READ</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> users.full_name, users.ssn, users.email <span class="hljs-keyword">WITH</span> REDACTION = MASKED
ALLOW <span class="hljs-keyword">READ</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> users.dob <span class="hljs-keyword">WITH</span> REDACTION = REDACTED</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, a marketing person needs someone’s name and email, but they don’t need the customer’s SSN or need to know how old someone is.</p>
<pre class="s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-delphi">ALLOW <span class="hljs-keyword">READ</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> users.full_name, users.email <span class="hljs-keyword">WITH</span> REDACTION = PLAIN_TEXT
ALLOW <span class="hljs-keyword">READ</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> users.dob <span class="hljs-keyword">WITH</span> REDACTION = MASKED
ALLOW <span class="hljs-keyword">READ</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> users.ssn <span class="hljs-keyword">WITH</span> REDACTION = REDACTED</code></pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With roles and policies similar to ones above in place, the same de-identified data is exchanged with the vault. Based on the role and associated access control policies for the caller, different views of the same sensitive data can be supported.</p>

<h2 id="h2-52d05fc93cf00">A privacy firewall for LLMs</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies can address privacy and compliance concerns with LLMs with a similar application of the data privacy vault architectural pattern. A data privacy vault prevents the leakage of sensitive data into LLMs, addressing privacy concerns around LLM training and inference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because data privacy vaults use modern privacy-enhancing technologies like polymorphic encryption and tokenization, sensitive data can be de-identified in a way that preserves referential integrity. This means that responses from an LLM containing de-identified data can be re-identified based on zero trust policies defined in the vault that let you make sure that only the right information is shared with the LLM user. This lets you make sure Susie in accounting only sees what she should have access to (i.e., account numbers and invoice amounts) while Bob in customer support sees only what he needs to do his job.</p>
<h3 id="h3-693528df68da0">Preserving privacy during model training</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To preserve privacy during model training, the data privacy vault sits at the head of your training pipeline. Training data that might include sensitive and non-sensitive data goes to the data privacy vault first. The vault detects the sensitive data, stores it within the vault, and replaces it with de-identified data. The resulting dataset is de-identified and safe to share with an LLM.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An LLM doesn’t care whether my name, Sean Falconer, is part of the training data or some consistently generated representation of my name (such as “dak5lhf9w”) is part of the training data. Eventually, it’s just a vector.</p>
<h3 id="h3-bc43b93df41d0">Preserving privacy during inference</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sensitive data may also enter a model during inference. In the example below, a prompt is created asking for a summary of a will. The vault detects the sensitive information, de-identifies it, and shares a non-sensitive version of the prompt with the LLM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the LLM was trained on non-sensitive and de-identified data, inference can be carried out as normal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On egress from the LLM, the response is passed through the data privacy vault for re-identification. Any de-identified data will be re-identified assuming the end-user has the right to see the information, according to explicit access control policies configured in the vault.</p>
<h3 id="h3-262c039832ad0">Privacy and compliance</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a privacy and compliance standpoint, using a data privacy vault means that no sensitive data is ever shared with an LLM, so it remains outside of the scope of compliance. Data residency, DSARs, and delete requests are now the responsibility of a data privacy vault that’s designed to handle these requirements and workflows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Incorporating the vault into the model training and inference pipelines allows you to combine the best of modern sensitive data management with any LLM stack, private, public, or proprietary.</p>
<h2 id="h2-6bc81835d0b60" style="text-align: justify;">Final thoughts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As every company gradually morphs into an AI company, it’s critically important to face data privacy challenges head-on. Without a concrete solution to data privacy requirements, businesses risk remaining stuck indefinitely in the “demo” or “proof-of-concept” phase. The fusion of data privacy vaults and generative AI offers a promising path forward, freeing businesses to harness the power of AI without compromising on privacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the widely recognized GDPR in Europe to Brazil&#8217;s LGPD regulations, and the more recent introduction of India&#8217;s DPDP law, over 100 countries now have some form of privacy regulation in place. What&#8217;s common among many of these regulations is the concept of data residency – the physical location of your data. However, each region&#8217;s requirements bring their own unique nuances, encompassing restrictions on data transfer, data storage locations, and individual data rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Navigating this complex sphere of privacy regulations is a huge burden for many companies born in the cloud. Their data simply ends up everywhere, and tracking down the locations, adhering to local laws, and even storing and using it locally is enormously complex and expensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past year, I&#8217;ve engaged with numerous companies eager to expand their businesses into new markets, such as Europe and Australia. However, they&#8217;ve encountered a significant roadblock – the absence of a robust technology solution to address the data residency requirements of these regions. As a result, they face the expensive and nightmarish scenario of duplicating their cloud infrastructure for each new region, which not only hampers operational efficiency but also limits their data analyst and scientists from running analytics globally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this blog post, I offer a solution to this pressing technology and business challenge by introducing a PII data privacy vault. This architectural approach to data privacy effectively removes the burden of data residency, compliance, and data security responsibilities from your infrastructure, providing a seamless path for global expansion and data management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#data-residency-and-barriers-to-expansion" name="data-residency-and-barriers-to-expansion"></a>Data Residency and Barriers to Expansion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To grasp the intricacies of regulatory compliance in the context of global expansion, it’s important to understand a few key concepts.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#compliance" name="compliance"></a>Compliance</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compliance denotes a business&#8217;s adherence to the laws and regulations governing data privacy and protection. These regulations are contingent on the geographic location of the customer whose data is being collected. Ensuring compliance is imperative for legal reasons as it shields businesses from financial penalties, license revocations, and the erosion of customer trust.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#data-residency" name="data-residency"></a>Data Residency</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data residency pertains to the physical location where customer data is stored. For instance, a website may serve customers in the EU, but their data could be hosted on a server located in Chicago. Different countries and regions have precise laws dictating how customer data should be handled, processed, stored, and safeguarded, making data residency a critical consideration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#varying-regulations" name="varying-regulations"></a>Varying Regulations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The complexity surrounding data residency and compliance obligations primarily arises from the diversity of regulations worldwide. For instance, the European Union (EU) has <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, Brazil follows <a href="https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=law&amp;c=BR">LGPD</a>, and the United States enforces a patchwork of state-specific laws like <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> in California and <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/AG/Sections/Privacy/The-Connecticut-Data-Privacy-Act">CTDPA</a> in Connecticut. These regulations diverge significantly in terms of their stipulations and penalties.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#barriers-to-global-expansion" name="barriers-to-global-expansion"></a>Barriers to Global Expansion</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The disparities in regulations and compliance requirements often pose formidable obstacles for companies striving to attain a global presence. Navigating diverse regulatory frameworks demands significant time, resources, and expertise. The resulting complexity frequently dissuades businesses from venturing into new markets, thereby constraining opportunities for global expansion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve looked at the problem, now, let’s explore an approach to addressing these challenges.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#what-is-a-data-privacy-vault" name="what-is-a-data-privacy-vault"></a>What is a Data Privacy Vault?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/post/what-is-a-data-privacy-vault">data privacy vault</a> isolates, protects, and governs access to sensitive customer data. Within the vault, confidential information is securely stored, while abstract and non-sensitive tokens, serving as references, are retained in conventional cloud storage. This means that only non-sensitive tokenized data is accessible to other systems, ensuring the utmost protection and compliance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a recent <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2022/10/09903879/1H0G8Iq3qDu">IEEE article</a>, the authors made a case that this architectural approach to data privacy is the future of privacy engineering. Just as any modern system likely contains back end services, a database, and a warehouse, all modern systems need a data privacy vault to safely store, handle, and use of sensitive customer PII.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u52ndrX6--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vzblx5jeeeeksf4isvwy.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u52ndrX6--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vzblx5jeeeeksf4isvwy.png?resize=800%2C501&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="501" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Traditional PII management versus a data privacy vault (source: <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2022/10/09903879/1H0G8Iq3qDu">IEEE</a>).</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s take a look at a specific example for a simple web application. In the image below, a phone number is being collected by a front-end application. For effective de-scoping, it’s ideal to initiate the de-identification process at the earliest stage in the data lifecycle. In this scenario, the phone number is stored directly within the vault during collection at the front end.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lqMUQq4a--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9gz9hlm5wab48b82nwba.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lqMUQq4a--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9gz9hlm5wab48b82nwba.png?resize=800%2C231&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="231" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Example of vault architecture for collecting sensitive customer PII.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the vault, the phone number, alongside any other personally identifiable information (PII), is stored within a robust and isolated environment, segregated from your organization&#8217;s existing infrastructure. All downstream services, ranging from application databases to data warehouses, analytics platforms, and logging systems, interact solely with tokenized (de-identified) representations of the data. Queries against the PII for specialized operations or algorithmic operations against PII execute directly within the vault.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Access to de-tokenize or re-identify data is controlled through a zero trust model. Policy-based rules control who sees what, when, where, and for how long on a row and column level.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zTLfPLv6--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0md5ni2i5mkbex583kas.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zTLfPLv6--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0md5ni2i5mkbex583kas.png?resize=800%2C242&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="242" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Controlling access to vault data based on who is requesting the data.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vault combines the principle of isolation, zero trust, privacy-enhancing technologies, and governance controls to insulate your systems from ever having to touch PII directly. This places your AWS components beyond the scope of regulatory compliance, assuring a higher level of data protection and adherence to data residency requirements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s assume we have a simple application infrastructure as shown below with AWS Amplify providing the web server infrastructure, DynamoDB for application storage, and Redshift for warehousing.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuQCnvic--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o7sbn94fbxb4ow2vsm4a.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuQCnvic--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o7sbn94fbxb4ow2vsm4a.png?resize=800%2C297&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="297" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Example web application infrastructure running on AWS.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without a vault in place, everything within our AWS account is under compliance and security scope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By introducing the vault as shown below (in this example, the collection of PII is handled directly from the vault), we de-scope all our AWS services. The services are only ever handling de-identified data, including the warehouse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many analytical operations can be performed with de-identified data provided the data is consistently generated. A warehouse doesn’t need to have access to someone’s name, it only needs a consistently generated representation of the name in order to execute counts, group bys, and joins.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With Skyflow, a data privacy vault company, you can host vaults in various global regions and route sensitive data to a specific regional vault for storage and use. For instance, consider how the following application architecture meets data residency requirements across multiple regions:</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tzf-4H6K--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/56yqh4iio5tlj31qlwg4.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tzf-4H6K--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/56yqh4iio5tlj31qlwg4.png?resize=800%2C392&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="392" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Using regional multiple vaults to comply with data residency requirements.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Your company’s site collects customer PII during account creation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">On the client side, the website detects the customer’s location.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Detecting that the customer is in the EU, the client-side code uses Skyflow’s SDK to collect the PII data and store it in your company’s data privacy vault in Frankfurt, Germany. Note: For customers based in the US, the PII data is instead routed to the data privacy vault in the US (in this case, Virginia).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The EU-based customer’s sensitive PII is stored in the EU-based data privacy vault, and Skyflow responds with de-identified data.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The client-side code sends the account request, now with de-identified data, to the server.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The server processes the request, storing the data (now de-identified and tokenized) in cloud storage in the “Oregon, US” region.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the week, your company’s Redshift instance in Tokyo, Japan, loads the data (already de-identified and tokenized) from cloud storage to perform analytics.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deploying multiple vaults situated in different regions streamlines the management of your sensitive data, ensuring compliance with data residency requirements across all your markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data privacy vault architecture significantly simplifies the complexities associated with data residency and compliance. Furthermore, by exempting Redshift (or any warehouse) from the compliance responsibilities tied to data residency, global analytics operations continue seamlessly within a single warehouse instance.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/de-scoping-your-aws-services-from-data-residency-requirements-7o#final-thoughts" name="final-thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compliance regulations, with their stringent data residency stipulations, necessitate businesses to maintain rigorous standards for data localization, protection, privacy, and security. Adhering to these regulations is essential to mitigating the risks associated with breaches, penalties, and potential damage to reputation. However, enterprises operating in various global regions, serving diverse customer bases, are left to deal with the complex task of navigating multiple regulatory landscapes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using data privacy vaults as your core infrastructure for customer PII offers a streamlined solution to simplify global compliance, particularly concerning AWS services and cloud storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a data privacy vault, organizations gain the ability to centralize the security of all sensitive data, effectively removing AWS and cloud storage from their compliance scope. By deploying data privacy vaults in various regions, companies can ensure that sensitive data storage and transmission align with the specific laws and regulations of each operational jurisdiction, thereby enhancing their overall compliance and security posture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/caesars-entertainment-data-breach-cyberattack">MGM and Caesars</a> spend millions of dollars on firewalls, SIEMs, HSMs, and a whole smorgasbord of cybersecurity tools and yet, they can’t protect your social security number.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From hotels and casinos to some of the most innovative technology companies in the world, why is it that companies with seemingly endless financial and talent resources can’t get a handle on their data security challenges?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe this is due to a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of data that started over 40 years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back in the 1980s, as computers found their way more and more into businesses, we lived in a disconnected world. To steal someone’s data, you had to physically steal the box the data lived on. As a consequence, we assumed that all data is created equal, that all data is simply ones and zeros, but this is wrong. All data isn’t created equal, some data is special, and needs to be treated that way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this blog post, I share my thoughts on what I refer to as the “Cheese and Diamond Problem” and how this has led to the data security challenges companies face today. I also offer explore an alternative approach, a new way of thinking, a privacy by engineering approach that helps us move towards a world where security is the default, and not bolted on.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#the-cheese-and-diamond-problem" name="the-cheese-and-diamond-problem"></a>The Cheese and Diamond Problem</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine that in my house I have cheese and I have diamonds. As a gracious host, I want guests of my home to be able to access my cheese. They should be able to freely go into the refrigerator and help themselves to some delicious cheese and perhaps a cracker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, I don’t want just anyone to touch my diamonds. Perhaps my diamonds even have sentimental value because it’s a diamond ring that’s been passed down through many generations in my family. Clearly the diamond is special.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, if I store my diamonds in the refrigerator next to my cheese, it makes controlling access to the diamonds much more challenging. By co-locating these very different objects, my refrigerator alone isn’t enough to make sure my wife has access to the diamonds and cheese, but my guests only have access to my cheese.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rules of engagement for something like diamonds are completely different than the rules of engagement for cheese. We all understand this distinction when it comes to physical objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is exactly why my passport and my children’s birth certificates aren’t in the junk drawer in my kitchen with my batteries and my flashlights. If someone breaks into my home and steals my batteries, it&#8217;s not that big a deal, but if someone steals my daughter’s birth certificate, then I not only feel like I’ve failed as a parent, but the information on her birth certificate is also now compromised forever. I can’t simply replace her date of birth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite all of us intuitively understanding that some physical objects are different, that they’re special, we somehow miss this point when we work with data. We don’t apply this thinking to Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We treat it like any other form of transactional or application data. We stuff it in a database, pass it around, make a million copies, and this leads to a whole host of problems.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#the-pii-replication-problem" name="the-pii-replication-problem"></a>The PII Replication Problem</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s consider a simple example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the diagram below, which represents an abstraction of a modern system, a phone number is being collected in the front end of the application, perhaps during account creation. That phone number ends up being passed downstream through each node and edge of the graph and at each node, we potentially end up with a copy of the phone number.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="15838" data-permalink="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2023/12/04/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem/the-pii-replication-problem/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png?fit=800%2C182&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,182" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="The PII replication problem." data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;The PII replication problem.&lt;/p&gt;
" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png?fit=300%2C68&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png?fit=800%2C182&amp;ssl=1" class="wp-image-15838 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem-300x68.png?resize=626%2C142&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="626" height="142" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png?resize=300%2C68&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png?resize=768%2C175&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-PII-replication-problem.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We store it in our database, in the warehouse, but we may also end up with a copy in our log files and the backups of all these systems. Instead of just having one copy of the phone number, we now have many copies and we need to protect all those locations and control access consistently wherever the data is stored.</p>
<p>Imagine that instead of having one copy of your passport that you keep in a secure location, you made 10,000 copies and then distributed them all over the world. Suddenly keeping your passport safe becomes a much harder problem in all 10,000 locations than if you have one copy secure in your home.</p>
<p>But this is exactly what we do with data.</p>
<p>We copy it everywhere and then attempt to lock down the hatches across all these systems and keep the policies and controls in sync about who can see what, when, and where. Additionally, because of the Cheese and Diamond Problem, we can’t adequately govern access to the data because the intermixing of our data conflates the rules of engagement about who has access. This quickly becomes an intractable problem because businesses don’t know what they’re storing or where it is, leading to the world we live in now where major corporations have data breaches on a regular basis.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#not-all-data-is-equal" name="not-all-data-is-equal"></a>Not All Data is Equal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Businesses are collecting and processing more data than ever. With the explosion of generative AI, as much as we are in an AI revolution, we are also in a data revolution. We can’t have powerful LLMs without access to massive data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies leverage their data to drive business decisions, product direction, help serve customers better, and even create new types of consumer experiences. However, as discussed, not all data is created equal, some data, like PII, is special.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over time, we’ve recognized that other forms of data like encryption keys, secrets, and identity are special and need to be treated that way. There was a time when we stored secrets in our application code or database. We eventually realized that was a bad idea and moved them into secret managers.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MqNfNWex--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q00jgb90exe60uant5h0.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MqNfNWex--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q00jgb90exe60uant5h0.png?resize=800%2C373&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="373" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Approaches to managing different types of sensitive data.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this progress, we are still left without an accepted standard for the storage and management of sensitive PII data. PII deserves the same type of special handling. You shouldn’t be contaminating your database with customer PII.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily there’s a solution to this problem originally pioneered by companies like Netflix, Google, Apple, and Goldman Sachs and now touted by the <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2022/10/09903879/1H0G8Iq3qDu">IEEE as the future of privacy engineering</a>, the PII Data Privacy Vault.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#the-pii-data-privacy-vault" name="the-pii-data-privacy-vault"></a>The PII Data Privacy Vault</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A data privacy vault isolates, protects, and governs access to sensitive customer data (i.e. PII) while also keeping it usable. With a vault approach, you remove PII from your existing infrastructure, effectively de-scoping it from the responsibility of compliance and data security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A vault is a first principles architectural approach to data privacy and security, facilitating workflows like:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>PII storage and management for regulated industries</li>
<li>PCI storage and payment orchestration</li>
<li>Data residency compliance</li>
<li>Privacy-preserving analytics</li>
<li>Privacy-preserving AI</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s go back to our example from earlier where we were collecting a phone number from the front end of an application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the vault world, the phone number is sent directly to the vault from the front end. From a security perspective, we ideally want to de-identify sensitive data as early in the life cycle as possible. The real phone number will only exist within the vault, it acts as a single source of truth that’s isolated and protected outside of the existing systems.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PcpKewrZ--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jbgoydsqjg5lppgsmzd4.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PcpKewrZ--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jbgoydsqjg5lppgsmzd4.png?resize=800%2C231&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="231" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Example of using a data privacy vault to de-scope an application.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vault securely stores the phone number and generates a de-identified reference in the form of a token that gets passed back to the front end. The token has no mathematical connection to the original data, so it can’t be reverse engineered to reveal the original value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This way, even if someone steals the data, as what happened with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-breach-highlights-shortfalls-of-encryption-11564738200">Capital One data breach</a>, the tokenized data carries no value. In fact, Capital One was fined only because they failed to tokenize all regulated data, some records were purely encrypted and those records were compromised.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#revealing-sensitive-data" name="revealing-sensitive-data"></a>Revealing Sensitive Data</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While it’s great to securely store sensitive data, if we simply lock it up and throw away the key, it’s not super useful. We store all this customer PII so we can use it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, we may need to reveal some of the data to a customer support agent, an IT administrator, a data analyst, or to the owner of the data. In this case, if we absolutely need to reveal some of the data, we want to re-identify it as late as possible, for example during render. We also want to limit what a user has access to based on the operations they need to perform with the data. While I might be able to see my full phone number, a customer support agent likely only needs the last four digits of my phone number and an analyst maybe only needs the area code for executing geo-based analytics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vault facilitates all of these use cases through a zero trust model where no one and no thing has access to data without explicit policies in place. The policies are built bottoms up, granting access to specific columns and rows of PII. This allows you to control who sees what, when, where, for how long, and in what format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s consider the situation where we have a user logging into an application and navigating to their account page. On the account page, we want to show the user their name, email, phone number, and home address based on the information they registered with us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the application database, we’ll have a table similar to the one shown below where the actual PII has been replaced by de-identified tokens.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aydT1udP--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nezhosf39pzwn1ih3hqo.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aydT1udP--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nezhosf39pzwn1ih3hqo.png?resize=800%2C137&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="137" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Example of users table within the application database.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As in the non-vault world, the application will query the application database for the user record associated with the logged in user. The record will be passed to the front end application and the front end will exchange the tokens for a representation of the original values depending on the policies in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the image below, the front end already has the tokenized data but needs to authenticate with the vault attaching the identity of the logged in user so that access is restricted based on the contextual information of the user’s identity. This is known as <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/post/dynamic-access-control-of-sensitive-user-data">context-aware authorization</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once authenticated and authorized, the front end can directly call the data privacy vault to reveal the true values of the user’s account information. But the front end only has access to this singular row of data and it&#8217;s limited to the few columns needed to render the information on the account page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HAnRyFJf--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9te7rbvv6vtz73v9nze7.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HAnRyFJf--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9te7rbvv6vtz73v9nze7.png?resize=800%2C284&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="284" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Example of revealing sensitive data for a single record.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#sharing-sensitive-data" name="sharing-sensitive-data"></a>Sharing Sensitive Data</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No modern application exists in a silo. Most applications need to share customer PII with third party services to send emails, SMS, issue a payment, or some other type of workflow. This is also supported by the vault architecture by using the vault as a proxy to the third party service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this case, instead of calling a third party API directly, you call the data privacy vault with the de-identified data. The vault knows how to re-identify the PII securely within its environment, and then securely share that with the third party service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this flow for sending HIPAA compliant forms of communication is shown below. The backend server calls the vault directly with tokenized data and the vault then shares the actual sensitive data with the third party communication service.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WPEGoLeF--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itxg8snimwn71ndxvxau.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WPEGoLeF--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itxg8snimwn71ndxvxau.png?resize=800%2C283&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="283" /></a></p>

<h2><a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-data-clouds-cheese-and-diamond-problem-1ehm#final-thoughts" name="final-thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve come a long way since building business applications in the 1980s, but we’ve failed to evolve our thinking regarding how we secure and manage customer PII. Point solutions like firewalls, encryption, and tokenization alone aren’t enough to address the fundamental problem. We need a new approach to cut to the root of the Cheese and Diamond Problem.</p>
<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wYC5tDw3--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vdsew9g3mzv9sc3w02kg.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wYC5tDw3--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_800/https%3A//dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vdsew9g3mzv9sc3w02kg.png?resize=800%2C378&#038;ssl=1" width="800" height="378" /></a></p>
<figure><figcaption><em>Not all data is the same, PII belongs in a data privacy vault.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data privacy vault provides such an approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s an architectural approach to data privacy where security is the default. Multiple techniques like polymorphic encryption, confidential computing, tokenization, data governance, and others combine with the principle of isolation and zero trust to give you all the tools you need to store and use PII securely without exposing your systems to the underlying data.</p>

This can bring incredible efficiency and reliability to data-driven decision-making processes. However, this practice comes with its share of challenges, primarily around data privacy, protection, and governance.</p>
<p id="9315" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s consider the construction of the LLM itself, which is trained on a massive amount of data collected from public and private sources. Without careful anonymization and filtering, sensitive data — such as PII or intellectual property — may be inadvertently included in the training set, potentially leading to a privacy breach.</p>
<p id="e451" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Furthermore, privacy concerns are introduced when interacting with LLMs, as users might input sensitive data, such as names, addresses, or even confidential business information. If these inputs aren’t handled properly, the misuse or exposure of this information is a genuine risk.</p>
<p id="9bca" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">In this post, we’ll explore how to work with LLMs in a privacy-preserving way when building an LLM-based chatbot. As we walk through the technology from end-to-end, we’ll highlight the most acute data privacy concerns and we’ll show how using a data privacy vault addresses those concerns.</p>
<p id="8e99" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s start by taking a closer look at the problem we need to solve.</p>
<h1 id="d673" class="mh mi ev be mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The problem: Protecting sensitive information from exposure by a chatbot</h1>
<p id="adea" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm nf lo lp lq ng ls lt lu nh lw lx ly ni ma mb mc nj me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Consider a company that has uses an LLM-based chatbot for its internal operations. The LLM for the chatbot was built by modifying a pre-existing base model with embeddings created from internal company documents. The chatbot provides an easy-to-use interface that lets non-technical users within the company access information from internal data and documents.</p>
<p id="2555" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">The company has a sensitive internal project called “Project Titan.” Project Titan is so important and so sensitive that only people working on Project Titan know about it. In fact, the team often says: the first rule of Project Titan is don’t talk about Project Titan. Naturally, the team wants to take advantage of the internal chatbot and also include Project Titan specific information to speed up creation of design documents, documentation, and press releases. However, they need to control who can see details about this sensitive project.</p>
<p id="93e8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">What we have is a tangible and pressing privacy concern that sits at the intersection of AI and data. These challenges appear extremely difficult to solve in a scalable and production-ready way. Simply having a private version of the LLM doesn’t address the core issue of data access.</p>
<h1 id="c1e8" class="mh mi ev be mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The proposed solution: Sensitive data de-identification and fine-grained access control</h1>
<p id="7990" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm nf lo lp lq ng ls lt lu nh lw lx ly ni ma mb mc nj me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Ultimately, we need to identify the key points where sensitive data must be de-identified during the process of building (or fine-tuning) the LLM and the end user’s interaction with the LLM-based chatbot. After careful analysis, we’ve identified that there are two key points in the process where we need to de-identify (and later re-identify) sensitive data:</p>
<ol class="" style="text-align: justify;">
<li id="fb56" class="lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu nk lw lx ly nl ma mb mc nm me mf mg nn no np bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="ll ew">Before ingestion</strong>: When documents from Project Titan are used to create embeddings, the project name, any PII, and anything else sensitive to the project must be de-identified. This de-identification should occur as part of the ETL pipeline prior to data ingestion into the LLM.</li>
<li id="fd5c" class="lj lk ev ll b lm nq lo lp lq nr ls lt lu ns lw lx ly nt ma mb mc nu me mf mg nn no np bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="ll ew">During use</strong>: When a user inputs data to the chatbot, any sensitive data included in that input must also be de-identified.</li>
</ol>
<p id="38e3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can de-identify sensitive data using Skyflow’s polymorphic encryption and tokenization engine that’s included within Skyflow Data Privacy Vault. This includes detection of PII but also terms you define within a sensitive data dictionary, like intellectual property (i.e. Project Titan).</p>
<p id="6bc4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Of course, only Project Titan team members who use the chatbot should be able to access the sensitive project data. Therefore, when the chatbot forms a response, we’ll rely on Skyflow’s governance engine (which provides fine-grained access control) and detokenization API to retrieve the sensitive data from the data privacy vault, making it available only to authorized end users.</p>
<p id="3af7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before we dive into the technical implementation, let’s go through a brief overview of foundational LLM concepts. If you’re already familiar with these concepts, you can skip the next section.</p>
<h1 id="d670" class="mh mi ev be mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">A brief primer on LLMs</h1>
<p id="bd22" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm nf lo lp lq ng ls lt lu nh lw lx ly ni ma mb mc nj me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">LLMs are sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) systems designed to analyze, generate, and work with human language. Built on advanced machine learning architectures, they are trained on vast quantities of text data, enabling them to generate text that is convincingly human-like in its coherence and relevance.</p>
<p id="c456" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">LLMs leverage a technology called <em class="nv">transformers </em>— one example is GPT, which stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer — to predict or generate a piece of text when given input or context. LLMs learn from patterns in the data they are trained on and then apply these learnings to understand newly given content or to generate new content.</p>
<p id="74f6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite their benefits, LLMs pose potential challenges in terms of privacy, data security, and ethical considerations. This is because LLMs can inadvertently memorize sensitive information from their training data or generate inappropriate content if not properly regulated or supervised. Therefore, the use of LLMs necessitates effective strategies for data handling, governance, and preserving user privacy.</p>
<h1 id="5430" class="mh mi ev be mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">A technical overview of the solution</h1>
<p id="84bd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm nf lo lp lq ng ls lt lu nh lw lx ly ni ma mb mc nj me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">When embarking on any LLM project, we need to start with a model. Many open-source LLMs have been released in recent months, each with its specific area of focus. Instead of building an entire LLM model from scratch, many developers choose a pre-built model and then adjust the model with vector embeddings generated from domain-specific data.</p>
<p id="e98e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Vector embeddings encapsulate the semantic relationship between words and help algorithms understand context. The embeddings act as an additional contextual knowledge base to help augment the facts known by the base model.</p>
<p id="008d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">In our case, we’ll begin with an <a class="af nw" href="https://huggingface.co/models?other=LLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">existing model from Hugging Face</a>, and then customize it with embeddings. <a class="af nw" href="https://huggingface.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Hugging Face</a> provides ML infrastructure services as well as open-source models and datasets.</p>
<p id="d15e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lj lk ev ll b lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">In addition to the Hugging Face model, we’ll use the following additional tools to build out our privacy-preserving LLM-based ETL pipeline and chatbot:</p>

Concerns about protecting the privacy and security of sensitive data are the biggest adoption blocker that prevents many companies from making full use of AI with their datasets.</p>

You can use Skyflow Data Privacy Vault to implement effective de-identification and data governance for LLM-based AI tools like chatbots.</p>

Because of data residency requirements, the location of sensitive data has significant regulatory compliance implications in countries and regions around the world.</p>
<p id="819c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">In this post, we’ll look at the challenges of managing data residency with Snowflake. We’ll start by examining how Snowflake Cloud Regions address data residency challenges, and consider the compliance implications of this approach — especially when loading data from cloud storage. Then, we’ll look at how to simplify data residency compliance using one or more regional data privacy vaults.</p>
<p id="365c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s begin with a deeper dive into data residency, and how it impacts compliance.</p>

Some jurisdictions have regulations that govern the protection and privacy of their residents’ PII, restricting how and where it’s used by businesses and other organizations.</p>
<p id="8489" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, the personal data (i.e., PII) of European Union residents cannot be transferred outside the EU without appropriate safeguards.</p>
<p id="52da" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">The laws of each jurisdiction impact how you transmit, manage, process, and store sensitive data in that jurisdiction. Because data residency dictates where (geographically ) data is stored in the cloud, data residency becomes a critical concern in cloud environments that handle sensitive data.</p>
<h1 id="3c5a" class="mi mj ev be mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf bj" style="text-align: left;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Choose your cloud region carefully</h1>

That’s because choosing storage regions is a weighty decision that can have a long-term impact on compliance, and on your business operations.</p>

When you create an account to deploy and set up Snowflake, whichever region you select becomes the primary location for data storage and for data processing resources.</p>
<p id="e74b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">At first glance, it might seem like Snowflake Cloud Regions provides a simple, effective solution to your data residency and compliance concerns. But for global companies who need global analytics, it isn’t that simple. That’s because, as noted in the Snowflake Cloud Regions documentation:</p>
<p id="33a7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="nl">Each Snowflake account is hosted in a single region.

<p id="4bad" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">This means that for each region where your business operates that has data residency requirements, you’ll need a different Snowflake account hosted in that region. Compliance becomes increasingly complex as you scale globally to more and more regions around the world. With this approach, running global analytics operations across different accounts to get a comprehensive view of your business can be a massive and ongoing challenge.</p>
<p id="859b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Instead of managing multiple Snowflake accounts with multiple Snowflake instances distributed in various regions around the world, you’d rather maintain a Snowflake instance in a single region to support global data operations. However, you still need to consider the need to honor data residency requirements for sensitive data so you can uphold your compliance obligations and safeguard customer trust.</p>
<p id="898f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, if you collect the personal data (PII) of customers located in the EU, but your Snowflake instance is located somewhere else, then you need to think through the privacy and compliance impact of storing and processing that data.</p>

<p id="9a0a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, let’s say that your company collects PII from both US and EU customers using its website.

<p id="661f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">How does transmitting this PII data to Australia, and then storing it in Australia, affect your compliance with regulations like the EU’s GDPR?</p>

<p id="2b05" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">Businesses that handle PII must ensure regulatory compliance by aligning their choice of cloud storage regions with the data residency requirements of markets where they operate.</p>

<p id="1299" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lk ll ev lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh eo bj" style="text-align: justify;" data-selectable-paragraph="">So, to briefly recap our problem:</p>

New speech synthesis models are able to produce speech that&#8217;s often indistinguishable from real speech. I&#8217;m sure many listeners have heard deep fakes where computer speech perfectly mimics the voice of famous actors or public figures. A major factor in driving the ongoing advances is generative AI.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Speechlab</strong> is at the forefront of using new AI techniques for realtime dubbing, which is the process of converting speech from one language into another. For the interested listener, we recommend hearing the examples with President Obama speaking Spanish or Elon Musk speaking Japanese in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5k1IhLl_HM">this YouTube video</a>. <strong>Ivan Galea</strong> is the Co-founder and President at Speechlab and he joins the show to talk about how we&#8217;re on the cusp of reaching the holy grail of speech technology &#8211; real time dubbing &#8211; and how this will erase barriers to communication and likely transform the world.</div>

Many developers have even fully integrated these tools into their workflows. One way these tools accelerate development is by autocompleting entire blocks of code. The AI achieves this by having awareness of the surrounding code. It understands context. However, in many cases the context available to an AI is limited. This restricts the AI&#8217;s ability to suggest more sweeping changes to a codebase, or even to refactor an entire application.</p>

He is now hard at work on the challenge of giving more context to AI &#8211; to make it aware of entire codebases, dependencies, error logs, and other data. Quinn joins the show today to talk about what it takes to move beyond code autocomplete, how to develop the next generation of coding AI, and what the future looks like for software engineers and programming languages.</p>

Database tuning is a process in which the configurations of a database are modified to achieve optimal performance. Databases have hundreds of configuration knobs that control various factors, such as the amount of memory to use for caches or how often the data is written to the storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with these knobs is that</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are not standardized (i.e., two databases may have a different name for the same knob),</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not independent (i.e., changing one knob can impact others), </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">and not universal (i.e., what works for one application may be suboptimal for another). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, information about the effects of the knobs typically comes only from (expensive) experience.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> is automatic database tuning software that promises to overcome these problems. It uses machine learning to tune the configuration knobs of your database automatically to improve performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we interview<a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo?lang=en"> Andy Pavlo</a>. Andy is a Database Professor at Carnegie Mellon and Co-Founder of OtterTune.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a machine learning model is trained and validated, it often feels like a major milestone has been achieved.  In reality, it’s more like the first lap in a relay race.  Deploying ML to production bears many similarities to a typical software release process, but brings several novel challenges like failing to generalize as expected or model drift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Quality management is the biggest challenge in AI today.  In this episode, I interview Anupam Datta, the co-founder at TruEra.  TruEra has a solution aimed at helping with AI performance, monitoring, and model explainability.  We talk about some of the challenges of modern machine learning deployment in production and how companies are succeeding with ML Ops.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Imagine a world where you own some sort of building whether that’s a grocery store, a restaurant, a factory&#8230; and you want to know how many people reside in each section of the store, or maybe how long did the average person wait to be seated or how long did it take the average factory worker to complete their assembly task.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently today these systems are either not using AI and instead use a mix of sensors and buttons to track certain actions or they do use AI but in a way that’s highly specific to their use case and hard to easily modify for new use cases that come down the line.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is where BrainFrame comes in. BrainFrame is a tool that connects to all your on-prem cameras and lets you easily leverage AI models and business logic. Alex Thiele is the CTO of Aotu the company that makes BrainFrame and he joins me today to talk about BrainFrame and the vision for a future where computer vision can be run by anyone.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments, consumers, and companies across the world are becoming more aware and attentive to the risks and causes of climate change. From recycling to using solar power, people are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Markets like the financial sector, governments, and consulting are looking for ways to understand climate data to make smart decisions and manage risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company Sust Global was founded as a way to deliver sustainable change and climate resilient action. Sust Global uses an AI-powered platform that combines climate science, satellite-derived data, and geospatial data sets to quantify climate change. Companies can use this analysis to evaluate risk to assets, better understand future commodities like metal, and plan for future supply chain challenges and climate perils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we talk to Josh Gilbert, CEO at Sust Global. Josh explains Sust Global’s mission and product, and discusses how companies use Sust Global to prepare and respond to climate change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are interfaces that enable multiple software applications to send and retrieve data from one another. They are commonly used for retrieving, saving, editing, or deleting data from databases, transmitting data between apps, and embedding third-party services into apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company BaseTen helps companies build and deploy machine learning APIs and applications. Using pre-existing ML models, or choosing from BaseTen’s library of pretrained models, BaseTen helps you instantly deploy API endpoints powered by those models to use in your applications. These APIs easily scale and integrate with existing data sources. BaseTen’s serverless infrastructure enables chaining model outputs and pre- and post- processing code. They also use a drag-and-drop UI builder to create custom UI’s for the applications, all without learning React. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we talk with Tuhin Srivastava and Amir Haghighat, founders at BaseTen. Tuhin previously founded Shape, and also worked as a Data Scientist at Gumroad. We discuss machine learning API development, scaling ML-driven applications, and the capabilities of BaseTen’s technology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using artificial intelligence and machine learning in a product or database is traditionally difficult because it involves a lot of manual setup, specialized training, and a clear understanding of the various ML models and algorithms. You need to develop the right ML model for your data, train the model, evaluate it, optimize it, analyze it for outliers and anomalies, assemble confidence ranges of the predictions and feature importance, and eventually deploy it to make predictions. An emerging field in AI, called Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), lowers these barriers to entry by using AI to automate much of this process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the market leaders in AutoML is MindsDB. Their service lets business users and developers make predictions on top of data at its source. Rather than make expensive copies of databases, a process that creates complex infrastructures, MindsDB trains and deploys models right inside the database. The results of their ML models can be queried with standard SQL statements and integrated into other applications as easily as querying any other database. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode we learn more about the progress that has been made in AutoML to simplify incorporating machine learning throughout organizations. We discuss the current features available from MindsDB, the difference their product has made for companies trying to leverage AI, and the future of AutoML and artificial intelligence generally. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation Labs is helping bring Europe 1 step closer to fully autonomous long haul trucking. They have developed an AI Driver Assistance System (AIDAS) that retrofits to any commercial vehicle, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting with VW Crafters and MAN TGE trucks. Their system uses camera hardware mounted to the vehicle to capture video data that is processed with computer vision to understand the context on the road. This piece of the system was developed by the world’s leading experts in computer vision. While the computer interprets what is happening on the road, data is sent to a processing system that can control the vehicle’s break, throttle, and steering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AIDAS system currently augments a driver’s role but does not replace the need for one yet. However, the difference between great drivers and bad drivers is around a 30% difference in fuel efficiency, according to Creation Labs. They have trained their systems with data from the best drivers in order to lower fuel costs for vehicles driven by their AIDAS. They’ve also built their system using the highest standards of safety.</span></p>
<p>Jakub Langr <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the CEO of Creation Labs and an Oxford-educated data scientist with 10 years of industry experience. He discusses Creation Labs’s vision for the future and the impact their incredible product is having on customers’ profit margins and emissions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vectors are the foundational mathematical building blocks of Machine Learning. Machine Learning models must transform input data into vectors to perform their operations, creating what is known as a vector embedding. Since data is not stored in vector form, an ML application must perform significant work to transform data in different formats into a form that ML models can understand. This can be computationally intensive and hard to scale, especially for the high-dimensional vectors used in complex models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinecone is a managed database built specifically for working with vector data. Pinecone is serverless and API-driven, which means engineers and data scientists can focus on building their ML application or performing analysis without worrying about the underlying data infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edo Liberty is the founder and CEO of Pinecone. Prior to Pinecone, he led the creation of Amazon SageMaker at AWS. He joins the show today to talk about the fundamental importance of vectors in machine learning, how Pinecone built a vector-centric database, and why data infrastructure improvements are key to unlocking the next generation of AI applications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incredible advances in machine learning research in recent years often take time to propagate out into usage in the field. One reason for this is that such “state-of-the-art” results for machine learning performance rely on the use of handwritten, idiosyncratic optimizations for specific hardware models or operating contexts. When developers are building ML-powered systems to deploy in the cloud and at the edge, their goals to ensure the model delivers the best possible functionality and end-user experience- and importantly, their hardware and software stack may require different optimizations to achieve that goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OctoML provides a SaaS product called the Octomizer to help developers and AIOps teams deploy ML models most efficiently on any hardware, in any context. The Octomizer deploys its own ML models to analyze your model topology, and optimize, benchmark, and package the model for deployment. The Octomizer generates insights about model performance over different hardware stacks and helps you choose the deployment format that works best for your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luis Ceze is the Co-Founder and CEO of OctoML. Luis is a founder of the ApacheTVM project, which is the basis for OctoML’s technology. He is also a professor of Computer Science at the University of Washington. Jason Knight is co-founder and CPO at OctoML. Luis and Jason join the show today to talk about how OctoML is automating deep learning engineering, why it’s so important to consider hardware when building deep learning systems, and how the field of deep learning is evolving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinforcement learning is a paradigm in machine learning that uses incentives- or “reinforcement”- to drive learning. The learner is conceptualized as an intelligent agent working within a system of rewards and penalties in order to solve a novel problem. The agent is designed to maximize rewards while pursuing a solution by trial-and-error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming a system to respond to the complex and unpredictable “real world” is one of the principal challenges in robotics engineering. One field which is finding new applications for reinforcement learning is the study of MEMS devices- robots or other electronic devices built at the micrometer scale. The use of reinforcement learning in microscopic devices poses a challenging engineering problem, due to constraints with power usage and computational power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathan Lambert is a PhD student at Berkeley who works with the Berkeley Autonomous Microsystems Lab. He has also worked at Facebook AI Research and Tesla. He joins the show today to talk about the application of reinforcement learning to robotics and how deep learning is changing the MEMS device landscape.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published July 30, 2019</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Internet of Things” is a term used to describe the increasing connectivity and intelligence of physical objects within our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT has manifested within enterprises under the term “Industrial IoT,” as wireless connectivity and machine learning have started to improve devices such as centrifuges, conveyor belts, and factory robotics. In the consumer space, IoT has moved slower than many people expected, and it remains to be seen when we will have widespread computation within consumer devices such as microwaves, washing machines, and lightswitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT computers have different constraints than general purpose computers. Security, reliability, battery life, power consumption, and cost structures are very different in IoT devices than in your laptop or smartphone. One technology that could solve some of the problems within IoT is WebAssembly, a newer binary instruction format for executable programs.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published April 17, 2019</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drishti is a company focused on improving manufacturing workflows using computer vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A manufacturing environment consists of assembly lines. A line is composed of sequential stations along that manufacturing line. At each station on the assembly line, a worker performs an operation on the item that is being manufactured. This type of workflow is used for the manufacturing of cars, laptops, stereo equipment, and many other technology products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Drishti, the manufacturing process is augmented by adding a camera at each station. Camera footage is used to train a machine learning model for each station on the assembly line. That machine learning model is used to ensure the accuracy and performance of each task that is being conducted on the assembly line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krish Chaudhury is the CTO at Drishti. From 2005 to 2015 he led image processing and computer vision projects at Google before joining Flipkart, where he worked on image science and deep learning for another four years. Krish had spent more than twenty years working on image and vision related problems when he co-founded Drishti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s episode, we discuss the science and application of computer vision, as well as the future of manufacturing technology and the business strategy of Drishti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niantic is the company behind Pokemon Go, an augmented reality game where users walk around in the real world and catch Pokemon which appear on their screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for augmented reality has existed for a long time. But the technology to bring augmented reality to the mass market has appeared only recently. Improved mobile technology makes it possible for a smartphone to display rendered 3-D images over a video stream without running out of battery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingress was the first game to come out of Niantic, followed by Pokemon Go, but there are other games on the way. Niantic is also working on the Niantic Real World platform, a “planet-scale” AR platform that will allow independent developers to build multiplayer augmented reality experiences that are as dynamic and entertaining as Pokemon Go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Franceus is an engineer at Niantic, and he joins the show to describe his experience building and launching Pokemon Go, as well as abstracting the technology from Pokemon Go and opening up the Niantic Real World platform to developers.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published December 9, 2019</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning algorithms have existed for decades. But in the last ten years, several advancements in software and hardware have caused dramatic growth in the viability of applications based on machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartphones generate large quantities of data about how humans move through the world. Software-as-a-service companies generate data about how these humans interact with businesses. Cheap cloud infrastructure allows for the storage of these high volumes of data. Machine learning frameworks such as Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch allow developers to easily train statistical models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These models are deployed back to the smartphones and the software-as-a-service companies, which improves the ability for humans to move through the world and gain utility from their business transactions. And as the humans interact more with their computers, it generates more data, which is used to create better models, and higher consumer utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of smartphones, cloud computing, machine learning algorithms, and distributed computing frameworks is often referred to as “artificial intelligence.” Chris Benson is the host of </span><a href="https://changelog.com/practicalai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the podcast Practical AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he joins the show to talk about the modern applications of artificial intelligence, and the stories he is covering on Practical AI. On his podcast, Chris talks about everything within the umbrella of AI, from high level stories to low level implementation details.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published January 25, 2019</em></p>
<p>When TensorFlow came out of Google, the machine learning community converged around it. TensorFlow is a framework for building machine learning models, but the lifecycle of a machine learning model has a scope that is bigger than just creating a model. Machine learning developers also need to have a testing and deployment process for continuous delivery of models.</p>
<p>The continuous delivery process for machine learning models is like the continuous delivery process for microservices, but can be more complicated. A developer testing a model on their local machine is working with a smaller data set than what they will have access to when it is deployed. A machine learning engineer needs to be conscious of versioning and auditability.</p>
<p>Kubeflow is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes based on Google’s internal machine learning pipelines. Google open sourced Kubernetes and TensorFlow, and the projects have users AWS and Microsoft. David Aronchick is the head of open source machine learning strategy at Microsoft, and he joins the show to talk about the problems that Kubeflow solves for developers, and the evolving strategies for cloud providers.</p>
<p>David was previously on the show when he worked at Google, and in this episode he provides some useful discussion about how open source software presents a great opportunity for the cloud providers to collaborate with each other in a positive sum relationship.</p>

<p><em>Originally published April 3, 2017</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hedge fund is a collection of investors that make bets on the future. The “hedge” refers to the fact that the investors often try to diversify their strategies so that the direction of their bets are less correlated, and they can be successful in a variety of future scenarios. Engineering-focused hedge funds have used what might be called “machine learning” for a long time to predict what will happen in the future.</span></p>
<p>Numerai is a hedge fund that crowdsources its investment strategies by allowing anyone to train models against Numerai’s data. A model that succeeds in a simulated environment will be adopted by Numerai and used within its real money portfolio. The engineers who create the models are rewarded in proportion to how well the models perform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xander Dunn is a software engineer at Numerai and in this episode he explains what a hedge fund is, why the traditional strategies are not optimal, and how Numerai creates the right incentive structure to crowdsource market intelligence. This interview was fun and thought provoking&#8211;Numerai is one of those companies that makes me very excited about the future.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published November 7, 2018</em></p>
<p>An instruction set defines a low level programming language for moving information throughout a computer. In the early 1970’s, the prevalent instruction set language used a large vocabulary of different instructions. One justification for a large instruction set was that it would give a programmer more freedom to express the logic of their programs.</p>
<p>Many of these instructions were rarely used. Think of your favorite programming language (or your favorite human language). What percentage of words in the vocabulary do you need to communicate effectively? We sometimes call these language features “syntactic sugar”. They add expressivity to a language, but may not improve functionality or efficiency.</p>
<p>These extra language features can have a cost.</p>
<p>Dave Patterson and John Hennessy created the RISC architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Compiler architecture. RISC proposed reducing the size of the instruction set so that the important instructions could be optimized for. Programs would become more efficient, easier to analyze, and easier to debug.</p>
<p>Dave Patterson’s first paper on RISC was rejected. He continued to research the architecture and advocate for it. Eventually RISC became widely accepted, and Dave won a Turing Award together with John Hennessy.</p>
<p>Dave joins the show to talk about his work on RISC and his continued work in computer science research to the present. He is involved in the Berkeley RISELab and works at Google on the Tensor Processing Unit.</p>
<p>Machine learning is an ocean of new scientific breakthroughs and applications that will change our lives. It was inspiring to hear Dave talk about the changing nature of computing, from cloud computing to security to hardware design.</p>

<p><em>October 1, 2019</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of self-driving cars is one of the biggest technological changes that is under way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the world, thousands of engineers are working on developing self-driving cars. Although it still seems far away, self-driving cars are starting to feel like an inevitability. This is especially true if you spend much time in downtown San Francisco, where you will see a self-driving car being tested every day. Much of the time, that self-driving car will be operated by Cruise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruise is a company that is building a self-driving car service. The company has hundreds of engineers working across the stack, from computer vision algorithms to automotive hardware. Cruise’s engineering requires engineers who can work with cloud tools as well as low-latency devices. It also requires product developers and managers to lead these different teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of self-driving is very new. There is not much literature available on how to build a self-driving car. There is even less literature on how to manage a team of engineers that are building, testing, and deploying software and hardware for real cars that are driving around the streets of San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Elshenawy is VP of engineering at Cruise, and he joins the show to talk about the engineering that is required to develop fully self-driving car technology, as well as how to structure teams to align the roles of product design, software engineering, testing, machine learning, and hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full disclosure: Cruise is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning models are only as good as the datasets they&#8217;re trained on. Aquarium is a system that helps machine learning teams make better models by improving their dataset quality. Model improvement is often made by curating high quality datasets, and Aquarium helps make that a reality. Peter Gao works on Aquarium, and he joins the show to talk through modern machine learning and the role of Aquarium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyperparameters define the strategy for exploring a space in which a machine learning model is being developed. Whereas the parameters of a machine learning model are the actual data coming into a system, the hyperparameters define how those data points are fed into the training process for building a model to be used by an end consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A different set of hyperparameters will yield a different model. Thus, it is important to try different hyperparameter configurations to see which models end up performing better for a given application. Hyperparameter tuning is an art and a science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Liaw is an engineer and researcher, and the creator of Tune, a library for scalable hyperparameter tuning. Richard joins the show to talk through hyperparameters and the software that he has built for tuning them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots are useful for developing well-defined applications such as first-contact customer support, sales, and troubleshooting. But the potential for chatbots is so much greater. Over the last five years, there have been numerous platforms that have arisen to allow for better, more streamlined chatbot creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dialogue software enables the creation of sophisticated chatbots. ParlAI is a dialogue platform built inside of Facebook. It allows for the development of dialogue models within Facebook. These chatbots can “remember” information from session to session, and continually learn from user input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Roller is an engineer who helped build ParlAI, and he joins the show to discuss the history of chatbot applications and what the Facebook team is trying to accomplish with the development of ParlAI.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image annotation is necessary for building supervised learning models for computer vision. An image annotation platform streamlines the annotation of these images. Well-known annotation platforms include Scale AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Crowdflower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also large consulting-like companies that will annotate images in bulk for you. If you have an application that requires lots of annotation, such as self-driving cars, then you might be compelled to outsource this annotation to such a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SuperAnnotate is an image annotation platform that can be used by these image annotation outsourcing firms. This episode explores SuperAnnotate, and the growing niche of image annotation. Vahan and Tigran Petrosyan are the founders of SuperAnnotate, and join the show for today’s interview.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug trials can lead to new therapeutics and preventative medications being discovered and placed on the market. Unfortunately, these drug trials typically require animal testing. This means animals are killed or harmed as a result of needing to verify that a drug will not kill humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal testing is unavoidable, but the extent to which testing needs to occur can be reduced by inserting machine learning models which simulate the effects of a drug on the human body. If the simulated effect is negative enough, animal testing doesn’t need to be run, thus no animals need to be harmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Vicknair and Jason Walsh work at VeriSIM Life, a company which makes software simulations of animals. These simulations can be used to model drug testing, and change the workflow for drug trials. They join the show to talk through the mechanics of drug testing, and how VeriSIM Life fits into that workflow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix runs all of its infrastructure on Amazon Web Services. This includes business logic, data infrastructure, and machine learning. By tightly coupling itself to AWS, Netflix has been able to move faster and have strong defaults about engineering decisions. And today, AWS has such an expanse of services that it can be used as a platform to build custom tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metaflow is an open source machine learning platform built on top of AWS that allows engineers at Netflix to build directed acyclic graphs for training models. These DAGs get deployed to AWS as Step Functions, a serverless orchestration platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savin Goyal is a machine learning engineer with Netflix, and he joins the show to talk about the machine learning challenges within Netflix, and his experience working on Metaflow. We also talk about DAG systems such as AWS Step Functions and Airflow.</span></p>

From the perspective of the machine learning researcher, there is the iterative process of tuning hyperparameters and selecting relevant features. From the perspective of the operations engineer, there is a handoff from development to production, and the management of GPU clusters to parallelize model training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last five years, machine learning has become easier to use thanks to point solutions. TensorFlow, cloud provider tools, Spark, Jupyter Notebooks. But every company works differently, and there are few hard and fast rules for the workflows around machine learning operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determined AI is a platform that provides a means for collaborating around data prep, model development and training, and model deployment. Neil Conway is a co-founder of Determined, and he joins the show to discuss the challenges around machine learning operations, and what he has built with Determined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deepgram is an end-to-end deep learning platform for speech recognition. Unlike the general purpose APIs from Google or Amazon, Deepgram models are custom-trained for each customer. Whether the customer is a call center, a podcasting company, or a sales department, Deepgram can work with them to build something specific to their use case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound data is incredibly rich. Consider all the features in a voice recording: volume, intonation, inflection. And once the speech is transcribed, there are many more features that can be discovered from the text transcription.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Stephenson is the CEO of Deepgram, and he joins the show to talk through end-to-end deep learning for speech, as well as the dynamics of the business and the deployment strategy for working with customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a customer service center, thousands of hours of audio are generated. This audio provides a wealth of information to transcribe and analyze. With the additional data of the most successful customer service representatives, machine learning models can be trained to identify which speech patterns are associated with a successful worker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By identifying these speaking patterns, a customer service center can continuously improve, with the different representatives learning the different patterns. The same is true for other speech-based tasks, such as sales calls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cresta is a company that builds systems to ingest high volumes of speech data in order to discover features that correlate with high performance human workers. Zayd Enam is a co-founder of Cresta, and joins the show to talk about the domain of speech data and what he and his team are building at Cresta.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published October 8, 2019. We are taking a few weeks off. We&#8217;ll be back soon with new episodes.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video surveillance impacts human lives every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On most days, we do not feel the impact of video surveillance. But the effects of video surveillance have tremendous potential. It can be used to solve crimes and find missing children. It can be used to intimidate journalists and empower dictators. Like any piece of technology, video surveillance can be used for good or evil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video recognition lets us make better use of video feeds. A stream of raw video doesn’t provide much utility if we can’t easily model its contents. Without video recognition, we must have a human sitting in front of the video to manually understand what is going on in that video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veronica Yurchuk and Kosh Shysh are the founders of Traces.ai, a company building video recognition technology focused on safety, anonymity, and positive usage. They join the show to discuss the field of video analysis, and their vision for how video will shape our lives in the future.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published June 13, 2019. We are taking a few weeks off. We&#8217;ll be back soon with new episodes.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning allows software to improve as that software consumes more data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is a tool that every software engineer wants to be able to use. Because machine learning is so broadly applicable, software companies want to make the tools more accessible to the developers across the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many steps that an engineer must go through to use machine learning, and each additional step inhibits the chances that the engineer will actually get their model into production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An engineer who wants to build machine learning into their application needs access to data sets. They need to join those data sets, and load them into a machine (or multiple machines) where their model can be trained. Once the model is trained, the model needs to test on additional data to ensure quality. If the initial model quality is insufficient, the engineer might need to tweak the training parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a model is accurate enough, the engineer needs to deploy that model. After deployment, the model might need to be updated with new data later on. If the model is processing sensitive or financially relevant data, a provenance process might be necessary to allow for an audit trail of decisions that have been made by the model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Story and Kelley Rivoire are engineers working on machine learning infrastructure at Stripe. After recognizing the difficulties that engineers faced in creating and deploying machine learning models, Stripe engineers built out Railyard, an API for machine learning workloads within the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob and Kelley join the show to discuss data engineering and machine learning at Stripe, and their work on Railyard.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published January 31, 2019. We are taking a few weeks off. We&#8217;ll be back soon with new episodes.</em></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is reshaping every aspect of our lives, from transportation to agriculture to dating. Someday, we may even create a superintelligence&#8211;a computer system that is demonstrably smarter than humans. But there is widespread disagreement on how soon we could build a superintelligence. There is not even a broad consensus on how we can define the term “intelligence”.</p>
<p>Information technology is improving so rapidly we are losing the ability to forecast the near future. Even the most well-informed politicians and business people are constantly surprised by technological changes, and the downstream impact on society. Today, the most accurate guidance on the pace of technology comes from the scientists and the engineers who are building the tools of our future.</p>
<p>Martin Ford is a computer engineer and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architects-Intelligence-truth-people-building/dp/1789131510/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548626153&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=architects+of+intelligence"><em>Architects of Intelligence</em>, a new book of interviews with the top researchers in artificial intelligence.</a> His interviewees include Jeff Dean, Andrew Ng, Demis Hassabis, Ian Goodfellow, and Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p><em>Architects of Intelligence</em> is a privileged look at how AI is developing. Martin Ford surveys these different AI experts with similar questions. How will China’s adoption of AI differ from that of the US? What is the difference between the human brain and that of a computer? What are the low-hanging fruit applications of AI that we have yet to build?</p>
<p>Martin joins the show to talk about his new book. In our conversation, Martin synthesizes ideas from these different researchers, and describes the key areas of disagreement from across the field.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruise is an autonomous car company with a development cycle that is highly dependent on testing its cars&#8211;both in the wild and in simulation. The testing cycle typically requires cars to drive around gathering data, and that data to subsequently be integrated into a simulated system called Matrix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With COVID-19, the ability to run tests in the wild has been severely dampened. Cruise cannot put so many cars on the road, and thus has had to shift much of its testing procedures to rely more heavily on the simulations. Therefore, the simulated environments must be made very accurate, including the autonomous agents such as pedestrians and cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Boyd is VP of Simulation at Cruise. He joins the show to talk about the testing workflow at Cruise, how the company builds simulation-based infrastructure, and his work managing simulation at the company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning workflows have had a problem for a long time: taking a model from the prototyping step and putting it into production is not an easy task. A data scientist who is developing a model is often working with different tools, or a smaller data set, or different hardware than the environment which that model will be deployed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This problem existed at Uber just as it does at many other companies. Models were difficult to release, iterations were complicated, and collaboration between engineers could never reach a point that resembled a harmonious “DevOps”-like workflow. To address these problems, Uber developed an internal system called Michelangelo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the engineers working on Michelangelo within Uber realized that there was a business opportunity in taking the Michelangelo work and turning it into a product company. Thus, Tecton was born. Tecton is a machine learning platform focused on solving the same problems that existed within Uber. Kevin Stumpf is the CTO at Tecton, and he joins the show to talk about the machine learning problems of Uber, and his current work at Tecton.</span></p>

TensorFlow Lite allows machine learning models to run on microcontrollers and other devices with only kilobytes of memory. Microcontrollers are very low-cost, tiny computational devices. They are cheap, and they are everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The low-energy embedded systems community and the machine learning community have come together with a collaborative effort called tinyML. tinyML represents the improvements of microcontrollers, lighter weight frameworks, better deployment mechanisms, and greater power efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach Shelby is the CEO of EdgeImpulse, a company that makes a platform called Edge Impulse Studio. Edge Impulse Studio provides a UI for data collection, training, and device management. As someone creating a platform for edge machine learning usability, Zach was a great person to talk to the state of edge machine learning and his work building a company in the space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots became widely popular around 2016 with the growth of chat platforms like Slack and voice interfaces such as Amazon Alexa. As chatbots came into use, so did the infrastructure that enabled chatbots. NLP APIs and complete chatbot frameworks came out to make it easier for people to build chatbots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first suite of chatbot frameworks were largely built around rule-based state machine systems. These systems work well for a narrow set of use cases, but fall over when it comes to chatbot models that are more complex. Rasa was started in 2015, amidst the chatbot fever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Rasa has developed a system that allows a chatbot developer to train their bot through a system called interactive learning. With interactive learning, I can deploy my bot, spend some time talking to it, and give that bot labeled feedback on its interactions with me. Rasa has open source tools for natural language understanding, dialogue management, and other components needed by a chatbot developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Bocklisch works at Rasa, and he joins the show to give some background on the field of chatbots and how Rasa has evolved over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning models require the use of training data, and that data needs to be labeled. Today, we have high quality data infrastructure tools such as TensorFlow, but we don’t have large high quality data sets. For many applications, the state of the art is to manually label training examples and feed them into the training process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snorkel is a system for scaling the creation of labeled training data. In Snorkel, human subject matter experts create labeling functions, and these functions are applied to large quantities of data in order to label it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I want to generate training data about spam emails, I don’t have to hire 1000 email experts to look at emails and determine if they are spam or not. I can hire just a few email experts, and have them define labeling functions that can indicate whether an email is spam. If that doesn’t make sense, don’t worry. We discuss it in more detail in this episode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braden Hancock works on Snorkel, and he joins the show to talk about the labeling problems in machine learning, and how Snorkel helps alleviate those problems. We have done many shows on machine learning in the past, </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/posts/machine-learning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which you can find on SoftwareDaily.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p>Descript is a software product for editing podcasts and video.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descript is a deceptively powerful tool, and its software architecture includes novel usage of transcription APIs, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and other domain-specific machine learning applications. Some of the most popular podcasts and YouTube channels use Descript as their editing tool because it provides a set of features that are not found in other editing tools such as Adobe Premiere or a digital audio workstation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descript is an example of the downstream impact of machine learning tools becoming more accessible. Even though the company only has a small team of machine learning engineers, these engineers are extremely productive due to the combination of APIs, cloud computing, and frameworks like TensorFlow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descript was founded by Andrew Mason, who also founded Groupon and Detour, and Andrew joins the show to describe the technology behind Descript and the story of how it was built. It is a remarkable story of creative entrepreneurship, with numerous takeaways for both engineers and business founders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these applications used supervised learning, a process in which labeled data sets are used to find correlations between the labels and the trends in that underlying data. But supervised learning is only one application of machine learning. Another broad set of machine learning methods is described by the term “reinforcement learning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with its environment. As the model interacts with the environment, it learns to make better decisions over time based on a reward function. Newer AI applications will need to operate in increasingly dynamic environments, and react to changes in those environments, which makes reinforcement learning a useful technique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinforcement learning has several attributes that make it a distinctly different engineering problem than supervised learning. Reinforcement learning relies on simulation and distributed training to rapidly examine how different model parameters could affect the performance of a model in different scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray is an open source project for distributed applications. Although Ray was designed with reinforcement learning in mind, the potential use cases go beyond machine learning, and could be as influential and broadly applicable as distributed systems projects like Apache Spark or Kubernetes. Ray is a project from the Berkeley RISE Lab, the same place that gave rise to Spark, Mesos, and Alluxio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RISE Lab is led by Ion Stoica, a professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is also the co-founder of Anyscale, a company started to commercialize Ray by offering tools and services for enterprises looking to adopt Ray. Ion Stoica returns to the show to discuss reinforcement learning, distributed computing, and the Ray project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoy the show, you can find all of our past episodes about machine learning, data, and the RISE Lab by going to </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftwareDaily.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and searching for the technologies or companies you are curious about .

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning algorithms have existed for decades. But in the last ten years, several advancements in software and hardware have caused dramatic growth in the viability of applications based on machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartphones generate large quantities of data about how humans move through the world. Software-as-a-service companies generate data about how these humans interact with businesses. Cheap cloud infrastructure allows for the storage of these high volumes of data. Machine learning frameworks such as Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch allow developers to easily train statistical models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These models are deployed back to the smartphones and the software-as-a-service companies, which improves the ability for humans to move through the world and gain utility from their business transactions. And as the humans interact more with their computers, it generates more data, which is used to create better models, and higher consumer utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of smartphones, cloud computing, machine learning algorithms, and distributed computing frameworks is often referred to as “artificial intelligence.” Chris Benson is the host of </span><a href="https://changelog.com/practicalai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the podcast Practical AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he joins the show to talk about the modern applications of artificial intelligence, and the stories he is covering on Practical AI. On his podcast, Chris talks about everything within the umbrella of AI, from high level stories to low level implementation details.</span></p>

<p><em>Originally published June 7, 2018</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Moore’s Law is less like a “law” and more like an observation or a prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore’s Law is ending. We can no longer fit an increasing amount of transistors in the same amount of space with a highly predictable rate. Dennard scaling is also coming to an end. Dennard scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, the power density stays constant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These changes in hardware trends have downstream effects for software engineers. Most importantly&#8211;power consumption becomes much more important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a software engineer, how does power consumption affect you? It means that inefficient software will either run more slowly or cost more money relative to our expectations in the past. Whereas software engineers writing code 15 years ago could comfortably project that their code would get significantly cheaper to run over time due to hardware advances, the story is more complicated today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is Moore’s Law ending? And what kinds of predictable advances in technology can we still expect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Hennessy is the chairman of Alphabet. In 2017, he won a Turing award (along with David Patterson) for his work on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Compiler) architecture. From 2000 to 2016, he was the president of Stanford University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John joins the show to explore the future of computing. While we may not have the predictable benefits of Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling, we now have machine learning. It is hard to plot the advances of machine learning on any one chart (as we explored </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/04/openai-compute-and-safety-with-dario-amodei/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a recent episode with OpenAI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). But we can say empirically that machine learning is working quite well in production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If machine learning offers us such strong advances in computing, how can we change our hardware design process to make machine learning more efficient?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As machine learning training workloads eat up more resources in a data center, engineers are developing domain specific chips which are optimized for those machine learning workloads. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) from Google is one such example. John mentioned that chips could become even more specialized within the domain of machine learning. You could imagine a chip that is specifically designed for a LSTM machine learning model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other domains where we could see specialized chips&#8211;drones, self-driving cars, wearable computers. In this episode, John describes his perspective on the future of computing, and offers some framework for how engineers can adapt to that future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software bugs cause unexpected problems at every company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some problems are small. A website goes down in the middle of the night, and the outage triggers a phone call to an engineer who has to wake up and fix the problem. Other problems can be significantly larger. When a major problem occurs, it can cause millions of dollars in losses and requires hours of work to fix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When software unexpectedly breaks, it is called an incident. To triage these incidents, an engineer uses a combination of tools, including Slack, GitHub, cloud providers, and continuous deployment systems. These different tools emit updates that can be received by an incident response platform, which allow the on-call engineer to have the information they need centralized to more easily work through the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-call rotation means that different people will be responsible for dealing with different incidents that occur. When an incident happens, the current engineer who is on-call may not be aware that a similar incident happened last week. It might be easier for the new engineer to triage the issue if they have insights about how the incident was managed during the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Riley is a DevOps advocate with Splunk. He joins the show to discuss the application of machine learning to incident response. We discuss the different data points that are created during an incident, and how that data can be used to build models for different types of incidents, which can generate information to help the engineer respond appropriately to an incident.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video surveillance impacts human lives every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On most days, we do not feel the impact of video surveillance. But the effects of video surveillance have tremendous potential. It can be used to solve crimes and find missing children. It can be used to intimidate journalists and empower dictators. Like any piece of technology, video surveillance can be used for good or evil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video recognition lets us make better use of video feeds. A stream of raw video doesn’t provide much utility if we can’t easily model its contents. Without video recognition, we must have a human sitting in front of the video to manually understand what is going on in that video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veronica Yurchuk and Kosh Shysh are the founders of Traces.ai, a company building video recognition technology focused on safety, anonymity, and positive usage. They join the show to discuss the field of video analysis, and their vision for how video will shape our lives in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of self-driving cars is one of the biggest technological changes that is under way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the world, thousands of engineers are working on developing self-driving cars. Although it still seems far away, self-driving cars are starting to feel like an inevitability. This is especially true if you spend much time in downtown San Francisco, where you will see a self-driving car being tested every day. Much of the time, that self-driving car will be operated by Cruise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruise is a company that is building a self-driving car service. The company has hundreds of engineers working across the stack, from computer vision algorithms to automotive hardware. Cruise’s engineering requires engineers who can work with cloud tools as well as low-latency devices. It also requires product developers and managers to lead these different teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of self-driving is very new. There is not much literature available on how to build a self-driving car. There is even less literature on how to manage a team of engineers that are building, testing, and deploying software and hardware for real cars that are driving around the streets of San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Elshenawy is VP of engineering at Cruise, and he joins the show to talk about the engineering that is required to develop fully self-driving car technology, as well as how to structure teams to align the roles of product design, software engineering, testing, machine learning, and hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full disclosure: Cruise is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large sales organization has hundreds of sales people. Each of those sales people manages a set of accounts who they are trying to close sales deals on. Sales people are overseen by managers who ensure that the sales people are performing well. Directors and VPs ensure the scalability and health of the overall sales organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales lifecycle mostly takes place within a piece of software called a CRM: customer relationship management. This tool documents the interactions between sales people and accounts. CRMs have been around for many years, and although CRM software is a useful repository of data, it does not fulfill all the needs of a salesperson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People.ai is a system of machine learning tools built around the sales tooling ecosystem. People.ai helps a sales organization avoid manual data entry, understand areas of potential improvement, and decide on who the highest value sales lead to pursue might be. Andrey Akselrod is the CTO At People.ai and he joins the show to discuss the potential applications of machine learning in the domain of sales, and the engineering work that his company has done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Internet of Things” is a term used to describe the increasing connectivity and intelligence of physical objects within our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT has manifested within enterprises under the term “Industrial IoT,” as wireless connectivity and machine learning have started to improve devices such as centrifuges, conveyor belts, and factory robotics. In the consumer space, IoT has moved slower than many people expected, and it remains to be seen when we will have widespread computation within consumer devices such as microwaves, washing machines, and lightswitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT computers have different constraints than general purpose computers. Security, reliability, battery life, power consumption, and cost structures are very different in IoT devices than in your laptop or smartphone. One technology that could solve some of the problems within IoT is WebAssembly, a newer binary instruction format for executable programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Beri is a software engineer and the organizer of the San Francisco WebAssembly Meetup. He has significant experience in the IoT industry, and joins the show to discuss the state of WebAssembly, the surrounding technologies, and their impact on IoT.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A grocery store contains fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and other items that can expire. In order to keep these items in stock, the store must be aware of how much food has been sold and what has gone bad. When a food item is low in stock, the store needs to order more of that food from a central distribution system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing food inventory is not simple. Some kinds of meat might expire faster than others. Avocados do not become ripe at the same rate as apples. In order to keep the shelves stocked, there are manual workflows for checking the inventory and ordering new inventory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh is a company that builds software for grocery stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh works with grocery chains that have a central distribution center. These grocery stores already have some software. At the back of the store, inventory management systems maintain records of the items that the store has on the shelves. At the front of the store, checkout systems detect what has been sold and help to update inventory. When the inventory is running low, the store can order more inventory from the central distribution center, so that trucks can deliver more inventory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh improves the operational intelligence of these stores by detecting spoilage among items that are prone to expiration, such as fruit. Volodomyr Kuleshov is the CTO and co-founder of Afresh and he joins the show to discuss the technical challenges of a grocery store, and the software that Afresh is building to make groceries more intelligent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niantic is the company behind Pokemon Go, an augmented reality game where users walk around in the real world and catch Pokemon which appear on their screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for augmented reality has existed for a long time. But the technology to bring augmented reality to the mass market has appeared only recently. Improved mobile technology makes it possible for a smartphone to display rendered 3-D images over a video stream without running out of battery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingress was the first game to come out of Niantic, followed by Pokemon Go, but there are other games on the way. Niantic is also working on the Niantic Real World platform, a “planet-scale” AR platform that will allow independent developers to build multiplayer augmented reality experiences that are as dynamic and entertaining as Pokemon Go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Franceus is an engineer at Niantic, and he joins the show to describe his experience building and launching Pokemon Go, as well as abstracting the technology from Pokemon Go and opening up the Niantic Real World platform to developers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning allows software to improve as that software consumes more data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is a tool that every software engineer wants to be able to use. Because machine learning is so broadly applicable, software companies want to make the tools more accessible to the developers across the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many steps that an engineer must go through to use machine learning, and each additional step inhibits the chances that the engineer will actually get their model into production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An engineer who wants to build machine learning into their application needs access to data sets. They need to join those data sets, and load them into a machine (or multiple machines) where their model can be trained. Once the model is trained, the model needs to test on additional data to ensure quality. If the initial model quality is insufficient, the engineer might need to tweak the training parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a model is accurate enough, the engineer needs to deploy that model. After deployment, the model might need to be updated with new data later on. If the model is processing sensitive or financially relevant data, a provenance process might be necessary to allow for an audit trail of decisions that have been made by the model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Story and Kelley Rivoire are engineers working on machine learning infrastructure at Stripe. After recognizing the difficulties that engineers faced in creating and deploying machine learning models, Stripe engineers built out Railyard, an API for machine learning workloads within the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob and Kelley join the show to discuss data engineering and machine learning at Stripe, and their work on Railyard. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drishti is a company focused on improving manufacturing workflows using computer vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A manufacturing environment consists of assembly lines. A line is composed of sequential stations along that manufacturing line. At each station on the assembly line, a worker performs an operation on the item that is being manufactured. This type of workflow is used for the manufacturing of cars, laptops, stereo equipment, and many other technology products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Drishti, the manufacturing process is augmented by adding a camera at each station. Camera footage is used to train a machine learning model for each station on the assembly line. That machine learning model is used to ensure the accuracy and performance of each task that is being conducted on the assembly line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krish Chaudhury is the CTO at Drishti. From 2005 to 2015 he led image processing and computer vision projects at Google before joining Flipkart, where he worked on image science and deep learning for another four years. Krish had spent more than twenty years working on image and vision related problems when he co-founded Drishti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s episode, we discuss the science and application of computer vision, as well as the future of manufacturing technology and the business strategy of Drishti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Google DeepMind came into the field, protein structure prediction was dominated by academics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein structure prediction is the process of predicting how a protein will fold by looking at genetic code. Protein structure prediction is a perfect field to approach through the application of deep learning, because the inputs are highly dimensional and there is a plentiful array of different sets of labeled data. Protein structure deep learning is a field in which many different approaches are taken, often involving supervised learning and reinforcement learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed Al Quraishi is a systems biologist at Harvard. His background spans computer engineering, statistics, and genetics. In his work, Mohammed explores the interplay between biology and computer systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area of Mohammed’s focus is protein structure prediction. </span><a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blog post last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mohammed gave a brief history of protein structure prediction and described the significance of DeepMind entering the field. DeepMind’s AlphaFold technology surpassed all other competitors in the most recent CASP protein structure competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed joins the show to discuss biology, academia, deep learning, and DeepMind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data sets can be modeled in a row-wise, relational format. When two data sets share a common field, those data sets can be combined in a procedure called a join. A join combines the data of two data sets into one data set that is often bigger than the initial two data sets independently occupied. In fact, this new data set is often so much bigger that it creates problems for the machine learning engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arun Kumar is an assistant professor at UC San Diego. He joins the show to discuss the modern lifecycle of machine learning models, and the gaps in the tooling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arun’s research into improving processing of joined data sets has been adopted by companies such as Google. Some of that research has been adapted into open source machine learning tools that improve the performance of machine learning jobs with minimal code required.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for electricity is based on the consumption of the electrical grid at a given time. The supply of electricity is based on how much energy is being produced or stored on the grid at a given time. Because these sources of supply and demand fluctuate rapidly but predictably, energy markets present profit opportunities for traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minh Dang and Corey Noone are engineers with Advanced Microgrid Solutions, a company that builds software to help traders capture better opportunities in the energy markets. Minh and Corey join the show to talk about how their company builds and deploys machine learning models for market prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We discussed data infrastructure, machine learning model deployments, and the dynamics of the energy markets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoox is a full-stack self-driving car company. Zoox engineers work on everything a self-driving car company needs, from the physical car itself to the algorithms running on the car to the ride hailing system which the company plans to use to drive around riders. Since starting in 2014, Zoox has grown to over 500 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethan Dreyfuss is a software infrastructure engineer at Zoox. He joins the show to discuss scaling an engineering team for self-driving. Machine learning was a big part of our conversation, because there are so many different approaches that an engineering team can take when it comes to machine learning for cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you take computer vision algorithms from academic papers and apply them to cars? Can you use the computer vision APIs from the cloud providers for anything useful? What about physical world mapping companies like Mapillary? How do you do data labeling, and data management? And how do you manage the interactions across the stack, from mechanical engineering to user interface design?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We touched on some of these areas, but barely scratched the surface of the self-driving car domain. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DoorDash is a food delivery company where users find restaurants to order from. When a user opens the DoorDash app, the user can search for types of food or specific restaurants from the search bar or they can scroll through the feed section and look at recommendations that the app gives them within their local geographic area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recommendations is a classic computer science problem. Much like sorting, or mapping, or scheduling, we will probably never “solve” recommendations. We will adapt our recommendation systems based off of discoveries in computer science and software engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One pattern that has been utilized recently by software engineers in many different areas is the “word2vec”-style strategy of embedding entities in a vector space and then finding relationships between them. If you have never heard of the word2vec algorithm, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/28/word2vec-with-adrian-colyer-holiday-repeat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can listen to the episode we did with computer scientist and venture capitalist Adrian Colyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or listen to this episode in which we will describe the algorithm with a few brief examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store2vec is a strategy used by DoorDash to model restaurants in vector space and find relationships between them in order to generate recommendations. Mitchell Koch is a senior data scientist with DoorDash, and he joins the show to discuss the application of store2vec, and the more general strategy of word2vec-like systems. This episode is also a great companion to our episode about data infrastructure at DoorDash.</span></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is reshaping every aspect of our lives, from transportation to agriculture to dating. Someday, we may even create a superintelligence&#8211;a computer system that is demonstrably smarter than humans. But there is widespread disagreement on how soon we could build a superintelligence. There is not even a broad consensus on how we can define the term “intelligence”.</p>
<p>Information technology is improving so rapidly we are losing the ability to forecast the near future. Even the most well-informed politicians and business people are constantly surprised by technological changes, and the downstream impact on society. Today, the most accurate guidance on the pace of technology comes from the scientists and the engineers who are building the tools of our future.</p>
<p>Martin Ford is a computer engineer and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architects-Intelligence-truth-people-building/dp/1789131510/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548626153&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=architects+of+intelligence">Architects of Intelligence, a new book of interviews with the top researchers in artificial intelligence.</a> His interviewees include Jeff Dean, Andrew Ng, Demis Hassabis, Ian Goodfellow, and Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>Architects of Intelligence is a privileged look at how AI is developing. Martin Ford surveys these different AI experts with similar questions. How will China’s adoption of AI differ from that of the US? What is the difference between the human brain and that of a computer? What are the low-hanging fruit applications of AI that we have yet to build?</p>
<p>Martin joins the show to talk about his new book. In our conversation, Martin synthesizes ideas from these different researchers, and describes the key areas of disagreement from across the field.</p>

<p>When TensorFlow came out of Google, the machine learning community converged around it. TensorFlow is a framework for building machine learning models, but the lifecycle of a machine learning model has a scope that is bigger than just creating a model. Machine learning developers also need to have a testing and deployment process for continuous delivery of models.</p>
<p>The continuous delivery process for machine learning models is like the continuous delivery process for microservices, but can be more complicated. A developer testing a model on their local machine is working with a smaller data set than what they will have access to when it is deployed. A machine learning engineer needs to be conscious of versioning and auditability.</p>
<p>Kubeflow is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes based on Google’s internal machine learning pipelines. Google open sourced Kubernetes and TensorFlow, and the projects have users AWS and Microsoft. David Aronchick is the head of open source machine learning strategy at Microsoft, and he joins the show to talk about the problems that Kubeflow solves for developers, and the evolving strategies for cloud providers.</p>
<p>David was previously on the show when he worked at Google, and in this episode he provides some useful discussion about how open source software presents a great opportunity for the cloud providers to collaborate with each other in a positive sum relationship.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robots are making their way into every area of our lives. Security robots roll around industrial parks at night, monitoring the area for intruders. Amazon robots tirelessly move packages around in warehouses, reducing the time and cost of logistics. Self-driving cars have become a ubiquitous presence in cities like San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a hacker in a dorm room, or a researcher in a small lab, how do you get started with robotics? There are drones and other small options like AWS DeepRacer&#8211;but what is the equivalent of the Raspberry Pi for large, human-sized robots?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach Allen is the founder of Slate Robotics, a company that makes large, human-sized robots that are at a low enough cost to be accessible to tinkerers, researchers, and prototype builders. Zach joins the show to talk about the state of robotics and why he started a robot company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Zach is doing is quite hard&#8211;he is a solo founder who has bootstrapped a robotics company from scratch. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEWiVd2vDnA&amp;t=11s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is set up in a strip mall in Missouri, where he has set up a row of 3-D printers to create the parts for his robots.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He programs and assembles these robots himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are interested in robots are thinking about starting a hardware company, this episode could be useful to you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machines understand the world through mathematical representations. In order to train a machine learning model, we need to describe everything in terms of numbers.  Images, words, and sounds are too abstract for a computer. But a series of numbers is a representation that we can all agree on, whether we are a computer or a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent shows, we have explored how to train machine learning models to understand images and video. Today, we explore words. You might be thinking&#8211;”isn’t a word easy to understand? Can’t you just take the dictionary definition?” A dictionary definition does not capture the richness of a word. Dictionaries do not give you a way to measure similarity between one word and all other words in a given language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word2vec is a system for defining words in terms of the words that appear close to that word. For example, the sentence “Howard is sitting in a Starbucks cafe drinking a cup of coffee” gives an obvious indication that the words “cafe,” “cup,” and “coffee” are all related. With enough sentences like that, we can start to understand the entire language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adrian Colyer is a venture capitalist with Accel, and blogs about technical topics </span><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as word2vec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We talked about word2vec specifically, and the deep learning space more generally. We also explored how the rapidly improving tools around deep learning are changing the venture investment landscape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving cars are here. Fully autonomous systems like Waymo are being piloted in less complex circumstances. Human-in-the-loop systems like Tesla Autopilot navigate drivers when it is safe to do so, and lets the human take control in ambiguous circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computers are great at memorization, but not yet great at reasoning. We cannot enumerate to a computer every single circumstance that a car might find itself in. The computer needs to perceive its surroundings, plan how to take action, execute control over the situation, and respond to changing circumstances inside and outside of the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lex Fridman has worked on autonomous vehicles with companies like Google and Tesla. He recently taught a class on deep learning for semi-autonomous vehicles at MIT, which is freely available online. There was so much ground to cover in this conversation. Most of the conversation was higher level. How do you even approach the problem? What is the hardware and software architecture of a car?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed talking to Lex, and if you want to hear more from him check out his podcast </span><a href="http://takeituneasy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take It Uneasy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is about jiu jitsu, judo, wrestling, and learning.</span></p>

There is no hidden information. There is no bluffing. Poker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be different! It is too human to be automated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game space of poker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different than that of Go. It has 10^160 different situations&#8211;which is more than the number of atoms in the universe. And the game space keeps getting bigger as the stack sizes of the two competitors gets bigger.</span></p>
<p>But it is still possible for a computer to beat a human at calculating game theory optimal decisions&#8211;if you approach the problem correctly.</p>
<p>Libratus was developed by CMU professor Tuomas Sandholm, along with my guest today Noam Brown. The Libratus team taught their AI the rules of poker, they gave it a reward function (to win as much money as possible), and they told it to optimize that reward function. Then they had Libratus train itself with simulations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After enough training, Libratus was ready to crush human competitors, which it did in hilarious, entertaining fashion. There is a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLXPGwJNLHk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video from Engadget on YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the AI competing against professional humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Noam Brown explains how they built Libratus, what it means for poker players, and what the implications are for humanity&#8211;if we can automate poker, what can’t we automate?</span></p>
<p>Stay tuned at the end of this episode for the Indeed Prime tip on hiring developers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volume of data in the world is always increasing. The costs of storing that data is always decreasing. And the means for processing that data is always evolving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensors, cameras, and other small computers gather large quantities of data from the physical world around us. User analytics tools gather information about how we are interacting with the Internet. Logging servers collect terabytes of records about how our systems are performing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the popularity of MapReduce, to the rise of open source distributed processing frameworks like Spark and Flink, to the wide variety of cloud services like BigQuery: there is an endless set of choices for how to analyze gigantic sets of data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning training and inference is another dimension of the modern data engineering stack. Whereas tools like Spark and BigQuery are great for performing ad-hoc queries, systems like TensorFlow are optimized for the model training and deployment process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stitching together these tools allows a developer to compose workflows for how data pipelines progress through a data engineering system. One popular tool for this is Apache Airflow, which was created in 2014 and is widely used at companies like Airbnb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few years, we will see a proliferation of new tools in the world of data engineering&#8211;and for good reason. There is a wealth of opportunity for companies to leverage their data to make better decisions, and potentially to clean and offer their internal data as APIs and pre-trained machine learning models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there is a vast number of enterprises who are modernizing their software development process with Kubernetes, cloud providers, and continuous delivery. Eventually, these enterprises will improve their complex software architecture, and will move from a defensive position to an offensive one. These enterprises will shift their modernization efforts from “DevOps” to “</span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/18/dataops-and-the-data-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DataOps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, and thousands of software vendors will be ready to sell them new software for modernizing their data platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is not a consensus for the best way to build and run a “data platform”. Nearly every company we have talked to on the show has a different definition and a different architecture for their “data platform”: </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/08/16/doordash-engineering-with-raghav-ramesh/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doordash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/18/dremio-data-engineering-with-tomer-shiran/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dremio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/09/28/prisma-graphql-infrastructure-with-soren-bramer-schmidt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prisma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/05/24/ubers-data-platform-with-zhenxiao-luo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/mapr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MapR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/15/data-warehouse-with-christian-kleinerman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowflake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/07/10/kafka-in-the-cloud-with-neha-narkhede/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confluent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/26/spark-and-streaming-with-matei-zaharia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Databricks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t expect to have a concise answer for how to run a data platform any time soon&#8211;but on the bright side, data infrastructure seems to be improving. Companies are increasingly able to ask questions about their data and get quick answers, in contrast to the data breadlines that were so prevalent five years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we cover yet another approach to large scale data processing.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/grailbio/reflow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a system for incremental data processing in the cloud. Reflow includes a functional, domain specific language for writing workflow programs, a runtime for evaluating those programs incrementally, and a scheduler for dynamically provisioning resources for those workflows. Reflow was created for large bioinformatics workloads, but should be broadly applicable to scientific and engineering computing workloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflow  evaluates programs incrementally. Whenever the input data or the program changes, only the outputs that depend on the changes are recomputed. This minimizes the amount of recomputation that needs to be performed across a computational graph.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marius Eriksen is the creator of Reflow and an engineer at GRAIL. He joins the show to discuss the motivation for a new data processing system&#8211;which involves explaining why workloads in bioinformatics are different than in some other domains.</span></p>

<p>An instruction set defines a low level programming language for moving information throughout a computer. In the early 1970’s, the prevalent instruction set language used a large vocabulary of different instructions. One justification for a large instruction set was that it would give a programmer more freedom to express the logic of their programs.</p>
<p>Many of these instructions were rarely used. Think of your favorite programming language (or your favorite human language). What percentage of words in the vocabulary do you need to communicate effectively? We sometimes call these language features “syntactic sugar”. They add expressivity to a language, but may not improve functionality or efficiency.</p>
<p>These extra language features can have a cost.</p>
<p>Dave Patterson and John Hennessy created the RISC architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Compiler architecture. RISC proposed reducing the size of the instruction set so that the important instructions could be optimized for. Programs would become more efficient, easier to analyze, and easier to debug.</p>
<p>Dave Patterson’s first paper on RISC was rejected. He continued to research the architecture and advocate for it. Eventually RISC became widely accepted, and Dave won a Turing Award together with John Hennessy.</p>
<p>Dave joins the show to talk about his work on RISC and his continued work in computer science research to the present. He is involved in the Berkeley RISELab and works at Google on the Tensor Processing Unit.</p>
<p>Machine learning is an ocean of new scientific breakthroughs and applications that will change our lives. It was inspiring to hear Dave talk about the changing nature of computing, from cloud computing to security to hardware design.</p>

<p>Google Search allows humans to find and access information across the web. A human enters an unstructured query into the search box, the search engine provides several links as a result, and the human clicks on one of those links. That link brings up a web page, which is a set of unstructured data. Humans can read and understand news articles, videos, and Wikipedia pages.</p>
<p>Google Search solves the problem of organizing and distributing all of the unstructured data across the web, for humans to consume. Diffbot is a company with a goal of solving a related, but distinctly different problem: how to derive structure from the unstructured web, understand relationships within that structure, and allow machines to utilize those relationships through APIs.</p>
<p>Mike Tung is the founder of Diffbot. He joins the show to talk about the last decade that he has spent building artificial intelligence applications, from his research at Stanford to a mature, widely used product in Diffbot. I have built a few applications with Diffbot, and I encourage anyone who is a tinkerer or prototype builder to play around with it. It’s an API for accessing web pages as structured data.</p>
<p>Diffbot crawls the entire web, parsing websites, using NLP and NLU to comprehend those pages, and using probabilistic estimations to draw relationships between entities. It’s an ambitious product, and Mike has been working on it for a long time. I enjoyed our conversation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Cancel has started five companies, most recently Drift. Drift is a conversational marketing and sales platform. David has a depth of engineering skills and a breadth of business experience that make him an amazing source of knowledge. In today’s episode, David discusses topics ranging from the technical details of making a machine learning-driven sales platform to the battle scars from his early career, when he spent a lot of time building products that people did not want. He has found success by focusing on building software that the market has shown a desire for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots were a popular, trendy subject a few years ago. The success of chatbots manifested in them fading into the background, and becoming a subtle, increasing part of our everyday interactions. Not every online interaction can be replaced by a chatbot, but many online interactions can be made more efficient by using chatbots. Chatbots can serve well-defined information, like product features, or the hours of operation of a business. When a chatbot gets a question that it cannot answer, the bot can route the conversation to a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a customer lands on a web page of a company using Drift, they see a chat box appear in the corner of the screen. The customer is able to communicate through that chat box with a bot that represents the company. The customer can learn about the product, schedule a call with a salesperson, and get other useful utilities from the Drift sales bot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Drift chatbot messaging system is handled by Elixir/Erlang. Erlang is widely known as the messaging language that was used to scale WhatsApp while maintaining high availability. On the backend, Java services take the interactions from the Driftbot and pull it into a CRM, which allows sales and marketing people to manage information about the customers that are interacting with the chatbot. David gives lots more detail around the engineering stack, the deployment model, and his thoughts on the business and modern engineering.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently launched a new podcast: Fintech Daily! Fintech Daily is about payments, cryptocurrencies, trading, and the intersection between finance and technology. You can find it on fintechdaily.co or Apple and Google podcasts. We are looking for other hosts who want to participate. If you are interested in becoming a host, send us an email: host@fintechdaily.co</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Brain is an engineering team focused on deep learning research and applications. One growing area of interest within Google Brain is that of generative models. A generative model uses neural networks and a large data set to create new data similar to the ones that the network has seen before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One approach to making use of generative models is GANs: generative adversarial networks. GANs can use a generative model (which creates new examples) together with a discriminator model (which can classify examples). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, let’s take the task of generating new pictures of cats. We want an artificial cat picture generator. First, we train a discriminator by feeding it billions of example pictures of cats. We now have a model that can tell what a cat is. Next, we make a model that generates completely random images. We feed those randomly generated images to the discriminator. The discriminator outputs a “loss” for these random images. Loss is a metric we can use to represent how far off a given image is from being something that the discriminator would recognize as a cat. Finally, you can feed this “loss” back into the generative model, so that the generative model will adjust its weights in a way that will reduce loss. Over time, the generator gets better and better at reducing loss, until the discriminator starts believing that some of these semi-random images are actually cats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative model systems have produced useful applications, such as object detection, image editing, and text-to-image generation. Today’s guest Doug Eck works on the Magenta team at Google Brain. Magenta uses applications of deep learning to produce tools and experiments around music, art, and creativity.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/05/01/google-brain-music-generation-with-doug-eck/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous show, Doug described his vision for humans and computers to work together on creative tasks such as music.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, we dive into some of the core machine learning building blocks that make machine creativity possible.</span></p>

<p>Stock traders have access to high volumes of information to help them make decisions on whether to buy an asset. A trader who is considering buying a share of Google stock can find charts, reports, and statistical tools to help with their decision. There are a variety of machine learning products to help a technical investor create models of how a stock price might change in the future.</p>
<p>Real estate investors do not have access to the same data and tooling. Most people who invest in apartment buildings are using a combination of experience, news, and basic reports.</p>
<p>Real estate data is very different from stock data. Real estate assets are not fungible&#8211;each one is arguably unique from all others, whereas one share of Google stock is the same as another share. But there are commonalities between real estate assets.</p>
<p>Just like collaborative filtering can be applied to find a new movie that is similar to the ones you have watched on Netflix, comparable analysis can be used to find an apartment building that is very similar to another apartment building which recently appreciated in asset value.</p>
<p>Skyline.ai is a company that is building tools and machine learning models for real estate investors. Or Hiltch is the CTO at Skyline.ai and he joins the show to explain how to apply machine learning to real estate investing. He also describes the mostly serverless architecture of the company. This is one of the first companies we have talked to that is so heavily on managed services and functions-as-a-service.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving transportation will be widely deployed at some point in the future. How far off is that future? There are widely varying estimations: maybe you will summon a self-driving Uber in a New York within 5 years, or maybe it will take 20 years to work out all of the challenges in legal and engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between now and the self-driving future, there will be a long span of time where cars are semi-autonomous. Maybe your car is allowed to drive itself in certain areas of the city. Maybe your car can theoretically drive itself in 99% of conditions, but the law requires you to be behind the wheel until the algorithms get just a little bit better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we wait for self-driving to be widely deployed to consumers, a lot could change in the market. We know about Uber, Lyft, Waymo, Tesla and Cruise. But what about the classic car companies like Ford, Mercedes Benz, and Volkswagen? These companies are great at making cars, and they have hired teams of engineers working on self-driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But self-driving functionality is not the only piece of software you need to compete as a transportation company. You also need to build a marketplace for your autonomous vehicles, because in the future, far fewer people will want to own a car. Customers will want to use transportation as a service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RideOS is a company that is building fleet management and navigation software. If you run a company that is building autonomous cars, you need to solve the problem of making an autonomous, safe robot that can drive you around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an autonomous car is hard, but to go to market as a next-generation transportation company, you also need fleet management software, so you can deploy your cars in an Uber-like transportation system. And you need navigation software so that your cars know how to drive around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RideOS lets a car company like Ford focus on building cars by providing a set of SDKs and cloud services for managing and navigating fleets of cars. Rohan Paranjpe joins today’s show to talk about the world of self-driving cars. Rohan worked at Tesla and Uber before joining RideOS, so he has a well-informed perspective on a few directions the self-driving car market might go in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DoorDash is a last mile logistics company that connects customers with their favorite national and local businesses. When a customer orders from a restaurant, DoorDash needs to identify the ideal driver for picking up the order from the restaurant and dropping it off with the customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process of matching an order to a driver takes in many different factors. Let’s say I order spaghetti from an Italian restaurant. How long does the spaghetti take to prepare? How much traffic is there in different areas of the city? Who are the different drivers who could potentially pick the spaghetti up? Are there other orders near the Italian restaurant, that we could co-schedule the spaghetti delivery with?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to perform this matching of drivers and orders, DoorDash builds machine learning models that take into account historical data. In today’s episode, Raghav Ramesh explains how DoorDash’s data platform works, and how that data is used to build machine learning models. We also explore the machine learning model release process—which involves backtesting, shadowing, and gradual rollout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the smartphone market there are two dominant operating systems: one closed source (iPhone) and one open source (Android). The market for self-driving cars could play out the same way, with a company like Tesla becoming the closed source iPhone of cars, and a company like Comma.ai developing the open source Android of self-driving cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Hotz is the CEO of Comma.ai. Comma makes hardware devices that allow users with “normal” cars to be augmented with advanced cruise control and lane assist features. This means you can take your own car&#8211;for example, a Toyota Prius&#8211;and outfit your car to have something similar to the Tesla Autopilot. Comma’s hardware devices cost under $1000 to order online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George joins the show to explain how the Comma hardware and software stack works in detail&#8211;from the low level interface with a car’s CAN bus to the high level machine learning infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users who purchase the Comma.ai hardware drive around with a camera facing the front of their windshield. This video is used to orient the state of the car in space. The video from that camera also gets saved and uploaded to Comma’s servers. Comma can use this video together with labeled events from the user’s driving experience to crowdsource their model for self-driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a user is driving down a long stretch of highway, and they turn on the Comma.ai driving assistance, the car will start driving itself and the video capture will begin. If the car begins to swerve into another lane, the user will take over for the car and the Comma system will disengage. This “disengagement” event gets labeled as such, and when that data makes it back to Comma’s servers, Comma can use the data to update their models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George is very good at explaining complex engineering topics, and is also quite entertaining and open to discussing the technology as well as other competitors in the autonomous car space. I have not been able to get many other people on the show to talk about autonomous cars, so this was quite refreshing! I hope to do more in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bots” are becoming increasingly relevant to our everyday interactions with technology. A bot sometimes mediates the interactions of two people. Examples of bots include automated reply systems, intelligent chat bots, classification systems, and prediction machines. These systems are often powered by machine learning systems that are black boxes to the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest Rob May argues that these systems should be auditable and accountable, and that using a blockchain-based identity system for bots is a viable solution to the machine learning auditability problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob is the CEO of Talla, a knowledge base provider for business teams. The Botchain project was spun out of Talla as a solution to the problem of bot identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we talk about Botchain and the application of blockchain to bot identity, the current state of ICOs, and the viability of utility token ecosystems. Botchain has its own cryptotoken called “Botcoin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning models allow our applications to perform highly accurate inferences. A model can be used to classify a picture as a cat, or to predict what movie I might want to watch. But before a machine learning model can be used to make these inferences, the model must be trained and deployed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the training process, a machine learning model consumes a data set and learns from it. The training process can consume significant resources. After the training process is over, you have a trained model that you need to get into production. This is known as the “deployment” step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deployment can be a hard problem. You are taking a program from a training environment to a production environment. A lot can change between these two environments. In production, your model is running on a different machine&#8211;which can lead to compatibility issues. If your model serves a high volume of requests, it might need to scale up. In production, you also need caching, and monitoring, and logging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large companies like Netflix, Uber, and Facebook have built their own internal systems to control the pipeline of getting a model from training into production. Companies who are newer to machine learning can struggle with this deployment process, and these companies usually don’t have the resources to build their own machine learning platform like Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego Oppenheiner is the CEO of Algorithmia, a company that has built a system for automating machine learning deployments. This is the second cool product that Algorithmia has built, the first being </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/06/19/algorithm-marketplace-diego-oppenheimer-algorithmia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the algorithm marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we covered in an episode a few years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s show, Diego describes the challenges of deploying a machine learning model into production, and how that product was a natural complement to the algorithms marketplace. Full disclosure: Algorithmia is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a patient comes into the hospital with stroke symptoms, the hospital will give that patient a CAT scan, a 3-dimensional imaging of the patient’s brain. The CAT scan needs to be examined by a radiologist, and the radiologist will decide whether to refer the patient to an interventionist&#8211;a surgeon who can perform an operation to lower the risk of long-term damage to the patient’s brain function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting the CAT scan, the patient might wait for hours before a radiologist has a chance to look at the scan. In that period of time, the patient’s brain function might be rapidly degrading. To speed up this workflow, a company called Viz.ai built a machine learning model that can recognize whether a patient is at high risk of stroke consequences or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have predicted that radiologists will be automated away by machine learning in the coming years. This episode presents a much more realistic perspective: first of all, we don’t have nearly enough radiologists, so if we can create automated radiologists that would be a very good thing; second of all, even in this workflow with a cutting-edge machine learning radiologist, you still need the human radiologist in the loop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Golan is the CTO at Viz.ai, and in today’s show he explains why he is working on a system for automated stroke identification, and the engineering challenges in building that system.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolutionary algorithms can generate surprising, effective solutions to our problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolutionary algorithms are often let loose within a simulated environment. The algorithm is given a function to optimize for, and the engineers expect that algorithm to evolve a solution that optimizes for the objective function given the constraints of the simulated environment. But sometimes these results are not exactly what we are looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, imagine an evolutionary algorithm that tries to evolve a creature that does a flip within a simulated physics engine that mirrors the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could imagine all sorts of evolutionary traits. Maybe the creature will evolve to have legs that are like springs, and let the creature jump high enough to do a flip. Maybe the creature will develop normal legs with strong muscles that propel the creature high enough to flip. But you wouldn’t expect the creature to evolve to be extremely tall&#8211;so tall that the creature can merely lean over fast enough so that the top of its body flips upside down. In one experiment, this is exactly what happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another, similar experiment, the evolving creature discovered a bug in the physics engine of the simulated environment. This creature was able to exploit the problem with this physics engine to be able to move in ways that would not be possible in our real-world physical universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolutionary algorithms sometimes evolve solutions in ways that we don’t expect. Researchers usually throw those results away, because they don’t contribute to the result that the researchers are looking for. The consequence is that lots of interesting anecdotes get lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Lehman, Dusan Misevic, and Jeff Clune are the lead authors of the paper “T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution.” The paper was a collection of anecdotes about strange results within the world of digital evolution. They join the show to describe what digital evolution is and some of the strange results that they surveyed in their paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Jeff are engineers at Uber’s artificial intelligence division&#8211;so this topic has applicable importance to them. Machine learning is all about evolution within simulated environments, and developing safe algorithms for AI requires an understanding of what can go wrong in a poorly defined evolutionary system.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit double about every two years. Moore’s Law is less like a “law” and more like an observation or a prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore’s Law is ending. We can no longer fit an increasing amount of transistors in the same amount of space with a highly predictable rate. Dennard scaling is also coming to an end. Dennard scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, the power density stays constant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These changes in hardware trends have downstream effects for software engineers. Most importantly&#8211;power consumption becomes much more important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a software engineer, how does power consumption affect you? It means that inefficient software will either run more slowly or cost more money relative to our expectations in the past. Whereas software engineers writing code 15 years ago could comfortably project that their code would get significantly cheaper to run over time due to hardware advances, the story is more complicated today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is Moore’s Law ending? And what kinds of predictable advances in technology can we still expect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Hennessy is the chairman of Alphabet. In 2017, he won a Turing award (along with David Patterson) for his work on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Compiler) architecture. From 2000 to 2016, he was the president of Stanford University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John joins the show to explore the future of computing. While we may not have the predictable benefits of Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling, we now have machine learning. It is hard to plot the advances of machine learning on any one chart (as we explored </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/04/openai-compute-and-safety-with-dario-amodei/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a recent episode with OpenAI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). But we can say empirically that machine learning is working quite well in production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If machine learning offers us such strong advances in computing, how can we change our hardware design process to make machine learning more efficient?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As machine learning training workloads eat up more resources in a data center, engineers are developing domain specific chips which are optimized for those machine learning workloads. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) from Google is one such example. John mentioned that chips could become even more specialized within the domain of machine learning. You could imagine a chip that is specifically designed for an LSTM machine learning model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other domains where we could see specialized chips&#8211;drones, self-driving cars, wearable computers. In this episode, John describes his perspective on the future of computing and offers some framework for how engineers can adapt to that future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications of artificial intelligence are permeating our everyday lives. We notice it in small ways&#8211;improvements to speech recognition; better quality products being recommended to us; cheaper goods and services that have dropped in price because of more intelligent production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what can we quantitatively say about the rate at which artificial intelligence is improving? How fast are models advancing? Do the different fields in artificial intelligence all advance together, or are they improving separately from each other? In other words, if the accuracy of a speech recognition model doubles, does that mean that the accuracy of image recognition will double also? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to know the answer to these questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning models trained today can consume 300,000 times the amount of compute that could be consumed in 2012. This does not necessarily mean that models are 300,000 times better&#8211;these training algorithms could just be less efficient than yesterday’s models, and therefore are consuming more compute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can observe from empirical data that models tend to get better with more data. Models also tend to get better with more compute. How much better do they get? That varies from application to application, from speech recognition to language translation. But models do seem to improve with more compute and more data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dario Amodei works at OpenAI, where he leads the AI safety team. In a post called “AI and Compute,” Dario observed that the consumption of machine learning training runs is increasing exponentially&#8211;doubling every 3.5 months. In this episode, Dario discusses the implications of increased consumption of compute in the training process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dario’s focus is AI safety. AI safety encompasses both the prevention of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">accidents</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the prevention of deliberate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">malicious</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AI application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, humans are dying in autonomous car crashes&#8211;this is an accident. The reward functions of social networks are being exploited by botnets and fake, salacious news&#8211;this is malicious. The dangers of AI are already affecting our lives on the axes of accidents and malice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be more accidents, and more malicious applications&#8211;the question is what to do about it. What general strategies can be devised to improve AI safety? After Dario and I talk about the increased consumption of compute by training algorithms, we explore the implications of this increase for safety researchers.</span></p>

Voice recordings can be turned into visualizations called spectrograms. Machine learning models can be trained to identify features of these spectrograms. Using this kind of analytic strategy, breakthroughs in voice analysis are happening at an amazing pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita Singh researches voice at Carnegie Mellon University. Her work studies the high volume of latent data that is available in the human voice. As she explains, just a small fragment of a human voice can be used to identify who a speaker is. Your voice is as distinctive as your fingerprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your voice can also reveal medical conditions. Features of the human voice can be strongly correlated with psychiatric symptom severity, and potentially heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. The human voice can even suggest a person’s physique&#8211;your height, weight, and facial features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Rita explains the machine learning techniques that she uses to uncover the hidden richness of the human voice.</span></p>

Kyle is one of the best explainers of machine learning concepts I have met, and for this episode, he presented some material that is perfect for this audience: machine learning for software engineers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.secondspectrum.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Spectrum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a company that analyzes data from professional sports, turning that data into visualizations, reports, and futuristic sports viewing experiences. We had a previous show about Second Spectrum where we went into the company in detail&#8211;it was an excellent show, so I wanted to have Kevin Squire, an engineer from Spectrum, come on the show to talk about how the company builds machine learning tools to analyze sports data. If you have not seen any of the visualizations from Second Spectrum, stop what you are doing and watch a video on it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we have had three Software Engineering Daily Meetups: in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. At each of these Meetups, listeners from the SE Daily community got to meet each other and talk about software&#8211;what they are building and what they are excited about. I was happy to be in attendance at each of these, and I am posting the talks given by our presenters. The audio quality is not perfect on these, but there are also no ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Telesign for graciously providing a space and some delicious food for our Meetup. Telesign has beautiful offices in Los Angeles, and they make SMS, voice, and data solutions. If you are looking for secure and reliable communications APIs, check them out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d love to have you as part of our community. We will have more Meetups eventually, and you can be notified of these by signing up for </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/register"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our newsletter.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Come to SoftwareDaily.com and get involved with the discussion of episodes and software projects.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorithms for building neural networks have existed for decades. For a long time, neural networks were not widely used. Recent changes to the cost of compute and the size of our data have made neural networks extremely useful. Our smartphones generate terabytes of useful data. Lower storage costs make it economical to keep that data. Cloud computing democratized the ability to do large scale machine learning across deep learning hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last few years, these trends have been driving widespread use of deep learning, in which neural nets with a large series of layers are used to create powerful results in various fields of classification and prediction. Neural networks are a tool for making sense of unstructured data&#8211;text, images, sound waves, and videos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unstructured” data is data with high volume or high dimensionality. For example, an image has a huge collection of pixels, and each pixel has a color value. One way to think about image classification is that you are finding correlations between those pixels. A certain cluster of pixels might represent an edge. After doing edge detection on pixels, you have a collection of edges. Then you can find correlations between those edges, and build up higher levels of abstraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yinyin Liu is a principal engineer and head of data science at the Intel AI products group. She studies techniques for building neural networks. Each different configuration of a neural network for a given problem is called a “topology.” Engineers are always looking at new topologies for solving a deep learning application&#8211;such as natural language processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Yinyin describes what a deep learning topology is and describes topologies for natural language processing. We also talk about the opportunities and the bottlenecks in deep learning&#8211;including why the tools are so immature, and what it will take to make the tooling better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keybase is a platform for managing public key infrastructure. Keybase’s products simplify the complicated process of associating your identity with a public key. Keybase is the subject of the first half of today’s show. Michael Maxim, an engineer from Keybase gives an overview of how the technology works and what kinds of applications Keybase unlocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second half of today’s show is about Clarifai. Clarifai is an AI platform that provides image recognition APIs as a service. Habib Talavati explains how Clarifai’s infrastructure processes requests, and the opportunities for improving the efficiency of that infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, we had three Software Engineering Daily Meetups: in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. At each of these Meetups, listeners from the SE Daily community got to meet each other and talk about software&#8211;what they are building and what they are excited about. I was happy to be in attendance at each of these, and I am posting the talks given by our presenters. The audio quality is not perfect on these, but there are also no ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Datadog for graciously providing a space for our Meetup, and for being a sponsor of SE Daily. You can sign up for Datadog and get a free t-shirt by going to <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/datadog">softwareengineeringdaily.com/datadog</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d love to have you as part of our community. We will have more Meetups eventually, and you can be notified of these by signing up for </span><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/register"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our newsletter.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Come to SoftwareDaily.com and get involved with the discussion of episodes and software projects.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rajat Monga is a director of engineering at Google where he works on TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a framework for numerical computation developed at Google. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of TensorFlow users are building machine learning applications such as image recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing&#8211;but TensorFlow is actually applicable to a broader range of scientific computation than just machine learning. TensorFlow has APIs for decision trees, support vector machines, and linear algebra libraries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current focus of the TensorFlow team is usability. There are thousands of engineers building data-intensive applications with TensorFlow, but Rajat and the rest of the TensorFlow team would like to see millions more. In today’s show, Rajat and I discussed how TensorFlow is becoming more usable, as well as some of the developments in TensorFlow around edge computing, TensorFlow Hub, and TensorFlow.js, which allows TensorFlow to run in the browser.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way to train a computer to recognize a picture of a cat is to show the computer a million labeled images of cats. The easiest way to train a computer to recognize a stop sign is to show the computer a million labeled stop signs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervised machine learning systems require labeled data. Today, most of that labeling needs to be done by humans. When a large tech company decides to “build a machine learning model,” that often requires a massive amount of effort to get labeled data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of thousands of knowledge workers around the world earn their income from labeling tasks. An example task might be “label all of the pedestrians in this intersection.” You receive a picture of a crowded intersection, and your task is to circle all the pedestrians. You have now created a piece of labeled data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scale API is a company that turns API requests into human tasks. Their most recent release is an API for labeling data that has been generated from sensors. As self-driving cars emerge onto our streets, the sensors on these cars generate LIDAR, radar, and camera data. The cars will interpret that data in real-time using their machine learning models, and then they will send that data to the cloud so that the data can be processed offline to improve the machine learning models of every car on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in that processing pipeline is the labeling&#8211;which is the focus of today’s conversation. Alexandr Wang is the CEO of Scale, and he joins the show to discuss self-driving cars, labeling, and the company he co-founded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few notes before we get started. We just launched the Software Daily, job board. To check it out, go to <a href="http://softwaredaily.com/jobs">softwaredaily.com/jobs</a>. You can post jobs, you can apply for jobs, and it’s all free. If you are looking to hire, or looking for a job, I recommend checking it out. And if you are looking for an internship, you can use the job board to apply for an internship at Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Meetups for Software Engineering Daily are being planned! Go to <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup">softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup</a> if you want to register for an upcoming Meetup. In March, I’ll be visiting Datadog in New York and Hubspot in Boston, and in April I’ll be at Telesign in LA.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest is a visual feed of ideas, products, clothing, and recipes. Millions of users browse Pinterest to find images and text that are tailored to their interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most companies, Pinterest started with a large monolithic application that served all requests. As Pinterest’s engineering resources expanded, some of the architecture was broken up into microservices and Dockerized, which make the system easier to reason about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To serve users with better feeds, Pinterest built a machine learning pipeline using Kafka, Spark, and Presto. User events are generated from the frontend, logged onto Kafka, and aggregated to build machine learning models. These models are deployed into Docker containers much like the production microservices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinnary Jangla is a senior software engineer at Pinterest, and she joins the show to talk about her experiences at the company&#8211;breaking up the monolith, architecting a machine learning pipeline, and deploying those models into production.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training a deep learning model involves operations over tensors. A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers. For several years, GPUs were used for these linear algebra calculations. That’s because graphics chips are built to efficiently process matrix operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensor processing consists of linear algebra operations that are similar in some ways to graphics processing&#8211;but not identical. Deep learning workloads do not run as efficiently on these conventional GPUs as they would on specialized chips, built specifically for deep learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to train deep learning models faster, new hardware needs to be designed with tensor processing in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xin Wang is a data scientist with the artificial intelligence products group at Intel. He joins today’s show to discuss deep learning hardware and Flexpoint, a way to improve the efficiency of space that tensors take up on a chip. Xin presented his work at NIPS, the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, and we talked about what he saw at NIPs that excited him. Full disclosure: Intel, where Xin works, is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A modern farm has hundreds of sensors to monitor the soil health, and robotic machinery to reap the vegetables. A modern shipping yard has hundreds of computers working together to orchestrate and analyze the freight that is coming in from overseas. A modern factory has temperature gauges and smart security cameras to ensure workplace safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these devices could be considered “edge” devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, these edge devices have mostly been used to gather data and save it to an on-premise server, or to the cloud. Today, as the required volumes of data and compute scale, we look for ways to better utilize our resources. We can start to deploy more application logic to these edge devices, and build a more sophisticated relationship between our powerful cloud servers and the less powerful edge devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soil sensors at the farm are recording long time series of chemical levels. The pressure sensors in a centrifuge are recording months and years of data. The cameras are recording terabytes of video. These huge data sets are correlated with labeled events&#8211;such as crop yields. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these large volumes of data, we can construct models for responding to future events. Deep learning can be used to improve systems over time. The models can be trained in the cloud and deployed to devices at the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aran Khanna is an AI engineer with Amazon Web Services, and he joins the show to discuss workloads at the cloud and at the edge&#8211;how work can be distributed between the two places, and the tools that can be used to build edge deep learning systems more easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation is changing the labor market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To automate a task, someone needs to put in the work to describe the task correctly to a computer. For some tasks, the reward for automating a task is tremendous&#8211;for example, putting together mobile phones. In China, companies like FOXCONN are investing time and money into programming the instructions for how to assemble your phone. Robots execute those instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FOXCONN spends millions of dollars deploying these robots, but it is a worthwhile expense. Once FOXCONN pays off the capital investment in those robots, they have a tireless workforce that can build phones all day long. Humans require training, rest, and psychological considerations. And with robots, the error rate is lower. Your smart phone runs your life, and you do not want the liability of human imperfection involved in constructing that phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we race towards an automated future, the manual tasks that get automated first depend on their economic value. The manual labor costs of smartphone construction is a massive expense for corporations. This is also true for truck driving, food service, and package delivery. The savings that will be reaped from automating these tasks are tremendous&#8211;regardless of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we automate them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There two ways of building automated systems: rule-based systems and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With rule-based systems, we can describe to the computer exactly what we want it to do&#8211;like following a recipe. With machine learning, we can train the computer by giving it examples and let the computer derive its own understanding of how to automate a task. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both approaches to automation have difficulties. A rule-based approach requires us to enumerate every single detail to the machine. This might work well in a highly controlled environment like a manufacturing facility. But rule-based systems don’t work well in the real world, where there are so many unexpected events, like snowstorms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we reported </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/07/28/self-driving-deep-learning-with-lex-fridman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a previous episode about how to build self-driving cars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, engineers still don’t quite know what the right mix of rule-based systems and machine learning techniques are for autonomous vehicles. But we will continue to pour money into solving this problem, because the investment is worth figuring out how to train the machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The routine tasks in our world </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be automated given enough time. How soon something will be automated depends on how expensive that task is when it is performed by a human, and how hard it is to design an artificial narrow intelligence to perform the task instead of a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manual software testing is another type of work that is being automated today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I am building a mobile app to play podcast episodes, and I make a change to the user interface, I want to have manual quality assurance (QA) testers run through tests that I describe to them, to make sure my change did not break anything. QA tests describe high level application functionality. Can the user register and log in? Can the user press the play button and listen to a podcast episode on my app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit tests are not good enough, because unit tests only verify the logic and the application state from the point of view of the computer itself. Manual QA tests ensure that the quality of the user experience was not impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many different device types, operating systems, and browsers, I need my QA test to be executed in all of the different target QA environments. This requires lots of manual testers. If I want manual testing for every deployment I push, that manual testing can get expensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RainforestQA is a platform for QA testing that turns manual testing into automated testing. The manual test procedures are recorded, processed by computer vision, and turned into automated tests. RainforestQA hires human workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to execute the well-defined manual tests, and the recorded manual procedure is used to train the machines that can execute the same task in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russell Smith is the CTO and co-founder of RainforestQA, and he joins the show to explain how RainforestQA works: the engineering infrastructure, the process of recruiting workers from mechanical turk, and the machine learning system for taking manual tasks and automating them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning models can be built by plotting points in space and optimizing a function based off of those points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, I can plot every person in the United States in a 3 dimensional space: age, geographic location, and yearly salary. Then I can draw a function that minimizes the distance between my function and each of those data points. Once I define that function, you can give me your age and a geographic location, and I can predict your salary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plotting these points in space is called embedding. By embedding a rich data set, and then experimenting with different functions, we can build a model that makes predictions based on those data sets. Yufeng Guo is a developer advocate at Google working on CloudML. In this show, we described two separate examples for preparing data, embedding the data points, and iterating on the function in order to train the model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a future episode, Yufeng will discuss CloudML and more advanced concepts of machine learning.</span></p>

<p>A basketball game gives off endless amounts of data. Cameras from all angles capture the players making their way around the court, dribbling, passing, and shooting. With computer vision, a computer can build a well-defined understanding for what a sport looks like. With other machine learning techniques, the computer can make predictions by combining historical data with a game that is going on right now.</p>
<p>Second Spectrum is a company that builds products for analyzing sports. At major basketball arenas, Second Spectrum cameras sit above the court, recording the game and feeding that information to the cloud. Second Spectrum’s servers crunch on the raw data, processing it through computer vision and putting it into deep learning models. The output can be utilized by teams, coaches, and fans.</p>
<p>Yu-Han Chang and Jeff Su are co-founders of Second Spectrum. They join the show to describe the data pipeline of Second Spectrum from the cameras on the basketball court to the entertaining visualizations. After talking to them, I am convinced that machine learning will completely change how sports are played&#8211;and will probably open up a platform for new sports to be invented.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The applications that demand deep learning range from self-driving cars to healthcare, but the way that models are developed and trained is similar. A model is trained in the cloud and deployed to a device. The device engages with the real world, gathering more data. That data is sent back to the cloud, where it can improve the model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the processor level to the software frameworks at the top of the stack, the impact of deep learning is so significant that it is driving changes everywhere. At the hardware level, new chips are being designed to perform the matrix calculations at the heart of a neural net. At the software level, programmers are empowered by new frameworks like Neon and TensorFlow. In between the programmer and the hardware, middleware can transform software models into representations that can execute with better performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milena Marinova is the senior director of AI solutions at the Intel AI products group, and joins the show today to talk about modern applications of machine learning and how those translate into Intel’s business strategy around hardware, software, and cloud. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca">From September 18-20, Milena is attending the O&#8217;Reilly AI Conference, hosted by Intel Nervana and O&#8217;Reilly.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I have a picture of a dog, and I want to search the Internet for pictures that look like that dog, how can I do that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to make an algorithm to build an index of all the pictures on the Internet. That index can define the different features of my images. I can find mathematical features in each image that describe that image. The mathematical features can be represented by a matrix of numbers. Then I can run the same algorithm on the picture of my dog, which will make another matrix of numbers. I can compare the matrix representing my dog picture to the matrices of all the pictures on the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what Google and Facebook do&#8211;and we covered this topic</span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/08/22/similarity-search-with-jeff-johnson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our episode about similarity search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few weeks ago. Today, we evaluate a similar problem: searching images within Squarespace. Squarespace is a platform where users can easily build their own website for blogging, e-commerce, or anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neel Vadoothker is a machine learning engineer at Squarespace, and he joins the show to talk about how and why he built a visual similarity search engine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machines understand the world through mathematical representations. In order to train a machine learning model, we need to describe everything in terms of numbers.  Images, words, and sounds are too abstract for a computer. But a series of numbers is a representation that we can all agree on, whether we are a computer or a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent shows, we have explored how to train machine learning models to understand images and video. Today, we explore words. You might be thinking&#8211;”isn’t a word easy to understand? Can’t you just take the dictionary definition?” A dictionary definition does not capture the richness of a word. Dictionaries do not give you a way to measure similarity between one word and all other words in a given language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word2vec is a system for defining words in terms of the words that appear close to that word. For example, the sentence “Howard is sitting in a Starbucks cafe drinking a cup of coffee” gives an obvious indication that the words “cafe,” “cup,” and “coffee” are all related. With enough sentences like that, we can start to understand the entire language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adrian Colyer is a venture capitalist with Accel, and blogs about technical topics </span><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as word2vec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We talked about word2vec specifically, and the deep learning space more generally. We also explored how the rapidly improving tools around deep learning are changing the venture investment landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about machine learning with guests like Matt Zeiler, the founder of Clarif.ai and Francois Chollet, the creator of Keras. You can check out our back catalog by downloading </span><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/software-engineering-daily-podcast-app/id1253734426?mt=8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Software Engineering Daily app for iOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where you can listen to all of our old episodes, and easily discover new topics that might interest you.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software companies that have been around for a decade have a ton of data. Modern machine learning techniques are able to turn that data into extremely useful models. Salesforce users have been entering petabytes of data into the company’s CRM tool since 1999. With its Einstein suite of products, Salesforce is using that data to build new product features and APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Chan is the senior director of product management with Einstein. He oversees the efforts to give longtime Salesforce customers new value, and the efforts to build brand new APIs for image recognition and recommendation systems, which can form the backbone of entirely new businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies spend billions of dollars on sales and marketing, and I wanted to understand where the best opportunities for Salesforce were. Simon and I spent much of our time exploring higher level applications, but we got to lower level engineering eventually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 600 episodes of Software Engineering Daily, and it can be hard to find the shows that will interest you. If you have an iPhone and you listen to a lot of Software Engineering Daily, check out the Software Engineering Daily mobile app in the iOS App Store. Every episode can be accessed through the app, and we give you recommendations based on the ones you have already heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation will make healthcare more efficient and less prone to error. Today, machine learning is already being used to diagnose diabetic retinopathy and improve radiology accuracy. Someday, an AI assistant will assist a doctor in working through a complicated differential diagnosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our hospitals look roughly the same today as they did ten years ago, because getting new technology into the hands of doctors and nurses is a slow process&#8211;just ask anyone who has tried to sell software in the healthcare space. But technological advancement in healthcare is inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosima Gretton is a medical doctor and a product manager with KariusDX, a company that is building diagnostic tools for infectious diseases. She writes about the future of healthcare, exploring the ways that workflows will change and how human biases could impact the diagnostic process&#8211;even in the presence of sophisticated AI.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Querying a search index for objects similar to a given object is a common problem. A user who has just read a great news article might want to read articles similar to it. A user who has just taken a picture of a dog might want to search for dog photos similar to it. In both of these cases, the query object is turned into a vector and compared to the vectors representing the objects in the search index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook contains a lot of news articles and a lot of dog pictures. How do you index and query all that information efficiently? Much of that data is unlabeled. How can you use deep learning to classify entities and add more richness to the vectors?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Johnson is a research engineer at Facebook. He joins the show to discuss how similarity search works at scale, including how to represent that data and the tradeoffs of this kind of search engine across speed, memory usage, and accuracy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving cars are here. Fully autonomous systems like Waymo are being piloted in less complex circumstances. Human-in-the-loop systems like Tesla Autopilot navigate drivers when it is safe to do so, and lets the human take control in ambiguous circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computers are great at memorization, but not yet great at reasoning. We cannot enumerate to a computer every single circumstance that a car might find itself in. The computer needs to perceive its surroundings, plan how to take action, execute control over the situation, and respond to changing circumstances inside and outside of the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lex Fridman has worked on autonomous vehicles with companies like Google and Tesla. He recently taught a class on deep learning for semi-autonomous vehicles at MIT, which is freely available online. There was so much ground to cover in this conversation. Most of the conversation was higher level. How do you even approach the problem? What is the hardware and software architecture of a car?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed talking to Lex, and if you want to hear more from him check out his podcast </span><a href="http://takeituneasy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take It Uneasy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is about jiu jitsu, judo, wrestling, and learning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart is a grocery delivery service. Customers log onto the website or mobile app and pick their groceries. Shoppers at the store get those groceries off the shelves. Drivers pick up the groceries and drive them to the customer. This is an infinitely complex set of logistics problems, paired with a rich data set given by the popularity of Instacart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Stanley is the VP of data science for Instacart. In this episode, he explains how Instacart’s 4-sided marketplace business is constructed, and how the different data science teams break down problems like finding the fastest route to groceries within a store, finding the best path to delivering groceries from a store to a user, and personalizing recommendations so people can find new items to try.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep learning allows engineers to build models that can make decisions based on training data. These models improve over time using stochastic gradient descent. When a model gets big enough, the training must be broken up across multiple machines. Two strategies for doing this are “model parallelism” which divides the model across machines and “data parallelism” which divides the data across multiple copies of the model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed deep learning brings together two advanced software engineering concepts: distributed systems and deep learning. In this episode, Will Constable, the head of distributed deep learning algorithms at Intel Nervana, joins the show to give us a refresher on deep learning and explain how to parallelize training a model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full disclosure: Intel is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily, and if you want to find out more about Intel Nervana including other interviews and job postings, go to <a href="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/intel">softwareengineeringdaily.com/intel</a>. Intel Nervana is looking for great engineers at all levels of the stack, and in this episode we’ll dive into some of the problems the Intel Nervana team is solving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans have now been defeated by computers at heads up no-limit holdem poker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people thought this wouldn’t be possible. Sure, we can teach a computer to beat a human at Go or Chess. Those games have a smaller decision space. There is no hidden information. There is no bluffing. Poker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be different! It is too human to be automated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game space of poker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different than that of Go. It has 10^160 different situations&#8211;which is more than the number of atoms in the universe. And the game space keeps getting bigger as the stack sizes of the two competitors gets bigger.</span></p>
<p>But it is still possible for a computer to beat a human at calculating game theory optimal decisions&#8211;if you approach the problem correctly.</p>
<p>Libratus was developed by CMU professor Tuomas Sandholm, along with my guest today Noam Brown. The Libratus team taught their AI the rules of poker, they gave it a reward function (to win as much money as possible), and they told it to optimize that reward function. Then they had Libratus train itself with simulations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After enough training, Libratus was ready to crush human competitors, which it did in hilarious, entertaining fashion. There is a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLXPGwJNLHk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video from Engadget on YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the AI competing against professional humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Noam Brown explains how they built Libratus, what it means for poker players, and what the implications are for humanity&#8211;if we can automate poker, what can’t we automate?</span></p>
<p>Stay tuned at the end of this episode for the Indeed Prime tip on hiring developers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convolutional neural networks are a machine learning tool that uses layers of convolution and pooling to process and classify inputs. CNNs are useful for identifying objects in images and video. In this episode, we focus on the application of convolutional neural networks to image and video recognition and classification.</span></p>
<p>Matt Zeiler is the CEO of Clarifai, an API for image and video recognition. Matt takes us through the basics of a convolutional neural network&#8211;you don’t need any background in machine learning to understand the content of the episode. He also discusses the subjective aspects of image and video recognition, and some of the tactics Clarifai has explored. This is far from a solved problem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt also discusses the infrastructure of Clarifai&#8211;how they use Kubernetes, how models are deployed, and how models are updated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most popular music today uses a computer as the central instrument. A single musician is often selecting the instruments, programming the drum loops, composing the melodies, and mixing the track to get the right overall atmosphere. </span></p>
<p>With so much work to do on each song, popular musicians need to simplify&#8211;the result is that pop music today consists of simple melodies without much chord progression.</p>
<p>Magenta is a project out of Google Brain to design algorithms that learn how to generate art and music. One goal of Magenta is to advance the state of the art in machine intelligence for music and art generation. Another goal is to build a community of artists, coders, and machine learning researchers who can collaborate.</p>
<p>Engineers today are happy to outsource server management to a cloud service provider. Similarly, a musician can use Magenta for creation of a melody, so she can focus on other aspects of a song, such as instrumentation.</p>
<p>Doug Eck is a research scientist at Google. In today’s episode, we explore the Magenta project and the future of music.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco. The theme of this Meetup is Fraud and Risk in Software.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hedge fund is a collection of investors that make bets on the future. The “hedge” refers to the fact that the investors often try to diversify their strategies so that the direction of their bets are less correlated, and they can be successful in a variety of future scenarios. Engineering-focused hedge funds have used what might be called “machine learning” for a long time to predict what will happen in the future.</span></p>
<p>Numerai is a hedge fund that crowdsources its investment strategies by allowing anyone to train models against Numerai’s data. A model that succeeds in a simulated environment will be adopted by Numerai and used within its real money portfolio. The engineers who create the models are rewarded in proportion to how well the models perform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xander Dunn is a software engineer at Numerai and in this episode he explains what a hedge fund is, why the traditional strategies are not optimal, and how Numerai creates the right incentive structure to crowdsource market intelligence. This interview was fun and thought provoking&#8211;Numerai is one of those companies that makes me very excited about the future.</span></p>

<p>Multiagent systems involve the interaction of autonomous agents that may be acting independently or in collaboration with each other. Examples of these systems include financial markets, robot soccer matches, and automated warehouses. Today’s guest Peter Stone is a professor of computer science who specializies in multiagent systems and robotics.</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss some of the canonical problems of multiagent systems, which have some overlap with the canonical problems of distributed systems&#8211;for example, the problems of coordinating between different agents with varying levels of trust resembles the problem of establishing consistency across servers in a database cluster.</p>
<p>Peter has recently contributed to the 100 year study of artificial intelligence, so we also had a chance to discuss the opportunities and roadblocks for AI in the near future. And since Peter teaches computer science at my alma mater, UT Austin, I had to ask him a few questions about the curriculum.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biology research is complex. The sample size of a biological data set is often too small to make confident judgments about the biological system being studied. </span></p>
<p>During Jason Knight’s PhD research, the RNA sequence data that he was studying was not significant enough to make strong conclusions about the gene regulatory networks he was trying to understand.</p>
<p>After working in academia, and then at Human Longevity, Inc Jason came to the conclusion that the best way to work towards biology breakthroughs was to work on the computer systems that enable those breakthroughs. He went to work at Nervana Systems on hardware and software for deep learning. Nervana was subsequently acquired by Intel. In this episode, we discuss how machine learning can be applied to biology today, and how industrial research and development is key to enabling more breakthroughs in the future.</p>
<p>The main lesson I took away from this show is that while we have seen phenomenal breakthroughs in certain areas of health&#8211;like image recognition applied to diabetic retinopathy or skin cancer&#8211;the challenges of reverse engineering our genome to understand how nucleic acids fit together into humans are still out of reach, and improving the hardware used for deep learning will be necessary to tackle these kinds of informational challenges.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every company that deals with payments deals with fraud. The question is not whether fraud will occur on your system, but rather how much of it you can detect and prevent. If a payments company flags too many transactions as fraudulent, then real transactions might accidentally get flagged as well. But if you don’t reject enough of the fraudulent transactions, you might not be able to make any money at all.</span></p>
<p>Because fraud detection is such a difficult optimization problem, it is a good fit for machine learning. Today’s guest Michael Manapat works on machine learning fraud detection at Stripe.</p>
<p>This conversation explores aspects of both data science and data engineering. Michael seems to benefit from having a depth of knowledge in both aspects of the data pipeline, which made me question whether data science and data engineering are roles that an engineering organization wants to separate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the third in a series of episodes about Stripe engineering. Throughout these episodes, we’ve tried to give a picture for how Stripe’s engineering culture works. We hope to do more experimental series like this in the future. Please give us feedback for what you think of the format by sending us email, joining the Slack group, or filling out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/softwareengineeringdaily.com/forms/d/19Za57bocA4316IvEtKyyixsrPq94sIw6l90Ju4nhwPQ/edit">listener survey</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning frameworks like Torch and TensorFlow have made the job of a machine learning engineer much easier. But machine learning is still hard. Debugging a machine learning model is a slow, messy process. </span></p>
<p>A bug in a machine learning model does not always mean a complete failure. Your model could continue to deliver usable results even in the presence of a mistaken implementation. Perhaps you made a mistake when cleaning your data, leading to an incorrectly trained model.</p>
<p>It is a general rule in computer science that partial failures are harder to fix than complete failures. In this episode, Zayd Enam describes the different dimensions on which a machine learning model can develop an error. Zayd is a machine learning researcher at the Stanford AI Lab, so I also asked him about AI risk, job displacement, and academia versus industry.</p>

Lots of engineers know these languages, and their ecosystems have great library support. But these languages have some issues around deployment, reproducibility, and other areas.

<p>Daniel Whitenack transitioned from doing most of his data science work in Python to writing code in Golang. In this episode, Daniel explains the workflow of a data scientist and discusses why Go is useful. We also talk about the blurry line between data science and data engineering, and how Pachyderm is useful for versioning and reproducibility. Daniel works at Pachyderm, and listeners who are more curious about it can check out the episode I did with <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/10/11/replacing-hadoop-with-joe-doliner">Pachyderm founder Joe Doliner</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning can be used to generate music. In the case of Feynman Liang’s research project BachBot, the machine learning model is seeded with the music of famous composer Bach. The music that BachBot creates sounds remarkably similar to Bach, although it has been generated by an algorithm, not by a human.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BachBot is a research project on computational creativity. Feynman Liang created BachBot using Python machine learning tools to build a long-short term memory model. Our conversation explores artificial intelligence, music, and his approach to this research project.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have probably read a news article that was written by a machine. When earnings reports come out, or a series of sports events like the Olympics occurs, there are so many small stories that need to be written that a news organization like the Associated Press would have to use all of its resources to write enough content to cover it all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wordsmith is a tool for automated content generation, and today’s guest Robbie Allen is the CEO of Automated Insights, the company that makes Wordsmith. He talks today about the wide range of uses for automated content, as well as how to engineer a product that takes data from a spreadsheet and turns it into a human-readable sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robbie is also speaking at the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/25365">O’Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference</a> in New York, September 26-27.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research in artificial intelligence takes place mostly at universities and large corporations, but both of these types of institutions have constraints that cause the research to proceed a certain way. In a university, basic research might be hindered by lack of funding. At a big corporation, the researcher might be encouraged to study a domain that is not squarely in the interest of public good&#8211;such as targeted advertising.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oren Etzioni is the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and in this episode we discuss AI research&#8211;from the doomful premonitions of Nick Bostrom to the unbridled optimism of Ray Kurzweil, as well as the realities of how AI research actually proceeds. Projects at the Allen Institute are defined and structured to solve problems in an intelligent, scalable fashion, so that engineering can proceed steadily from the local maxima of a problem domain to the global maxima. The Allen Institute seeks to bridge the gap by providing ample funding for open source AI research for the common good.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oren is also speaking at the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/25365">O’Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference in New York, September 26-27</a>.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per Harald Borgen is a developer at Xeneta. He started programming fairly recently, but has already built a machine learning application that cuts down on the time his sales team has to spend qualifying leads. What I found most interesting about this episode was that machine learning gets used by a single developer to solve a simple business problem and deliver solid value. This is in contrast to how many of us think about machine learning&#8211;as an intimidating domain that requires a large team to build anything meaningful.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war against spam has been going on for decades. Email spam blockers and ad blockers help protect us from unwanted messages in our communication and browsing experience. These spam prevention tools are powered by machine learning, which catches most of the emails and ads that we don’t want to see. TrueCaller is a company that is bringing this quality of spam detection to our phone call systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Umut Alp is the CTO of TrueCaller, and he joins the show today to break down the engineering problems of preventing telephone call spam. Users of TrueCaller install it on their phones, and the software allows users to report when they have received a spam call. Using this reporting mechanism, and other learning algorithms, TrueCaller is able to learn what types of calls it should block from being accepted by your phone. Today on Software Engineering Daily, we discuss cell phone spam prevention.<br />

<h3>“Building a model to predict disease and deploying that in the wild – the bar for success is much higher there than, say, deciding what ad to show you.”</h3>
<p>Diagnosing illness today requires the trained eye of a doctor. With machine learning, we might someday be able to diagnose illness using only a data set. Today on Software Engineering Daily, we are joined by David Kale, a researcher at the intersection of machine learning and clinical data. We discuss the machine learning and research techniques he is using to diagnose illnesses using neural networks, and we also talk about the challenges of performing data science in hospitals, where the data is mostly confidential. David will also be presenting at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/9373">Strata + Hadoop World</a> in San Jose. We&#8217;re partnering with O&#8217;Reilly to support this conference &#8211; if you want to go to Strata, you can save 20% off a ticket with our code PCSED.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What kind of work does a data scientist at a children’s hospital do?</li>
<li>Where is machine learning actually improving healthcare?</li>
<li>What types of data are present in the intensive care unit?</li>
<li>Can you give me an example of how you used an LSTM to make a prediction?</li>
<li>What were the results of your recurrent neural network experiments?</li>
<li>Do you think that deep learning is overhyped right now?</li>

<h3>“Nothing’s cool unless you call it ‘as a service.’ ”</h3>
<p>Monsanto is a company that is known for its chemical and biological engineering. It is less well known for its data science and software engineering teams. Tim Williamson is a data scientist at Monsanto, and on today’s show he talked about how he and a small group of engineers at Monsanto dramatically shifted the culture around data science-driven genetic engineering.</p>
<p>In this episode, Tim explains how useful graph databases are for modeling the genetic lineages, and talks about how Monsanto manages simulations and experiments on their genomics software pipeline. Tim also talks about how just a few engineers can create a cultural shift within a large company like Monsanto using the leverage allowed by software.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why is data science important to Monsanto?</li>
<li>How will data science be used in the future to improve food production?</li>
<li>What are a genomics pipeline and a breeding cycle?</li>
<li>Can you use simulations to improve genetic predictions?</li>
<li>Why are graph databases useful for Monsanto?</li>
<li>What is ancestry-as-a-service?</li>
<li>Are there any agri-tech companies or products that are really exciting to you?</li>
<li>Is it realistic or desirable to move to a meat-free nutrition model?</li>

<h3>“I definitely think we can try to abstract away the first principles of intelligence and then try to go from these principles to an intelligent machine that might look nothing like the brain.”</h3>
<p>Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. In this episode, François discusses the state of deep learning, and explains why the field is experiencing a cambrian explosion that eventually may taper off. He explains the need for Keras and why its simplicity and ease makes it a useful deep learning library for developers to experiment and build with.</p>
<p>François Chollet is the author of Keras and the founder of <a href="http://www.wysp.ws/">Wysp</a>, learning platform for artists. He currently works for Google as a deep learning engineer and researcher.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you try to design intelligent machines using the human brain as a blueprint?</li>
<li>How has the structure of software engineering teams changed to accommodate the addition of machine learning?</li>
<li>What are the best practices for deploying machine learning systems developed in production by data scientists?</li>
<li>Why do neural network developers need to be able to perform fast experimentation?</li>
<li>Why is modularity important to a deep learning library?</li>
<li>How does Keras interface with the GPU?</li>
<li>What are the interesting trends you notice in machine learning?</li>

<h3>“You’ve got software engineers who are interested in machine learning, and think what they need to do is just bring in another module and then that will solve their problem. It’s particularly important for those people to understand that this is a different type of beast.”</h3>
<p>Machine learning is something that many business are starting to tack onto their existing processes. Yet, to add machine learning capabilities after the fact is often a fool&#8217;s errand. Joshua argues that machine learning cannot be an afterthought, but rather must be custom developed to suit the specific problem or question that each company is trying to answer. His company, <a href="http://www.wise.io/">Wise.io</a>, tackles this challenge of helping business build ground up machine learning applications that generate accurate predictions for use in an array of business processes.</p>
<p>Joshua Bloom is the cofounder and CTO of Wise.io. He is also an astrophysicist, and a professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley.</p>

<h3>“You don’t mind if failures slow things down, but its very important that failures do not stop forward progress.”</h3>
<p>TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library intended to bring large-scale, distributed machine learning and deep learning to everyone. Google recently released the framework to the public as a second-generation API, having learned from the successes and failures of <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4687-large-scale-distributed-deep-networks.pdf">DistBelief</a>.</p>
<p>Greg Corrado is a senior research scientist and tech lead at Google, where he focuses on the research areas of machine intelligence, machine perception and natural language processing.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the end-user’s point of view, how does Smart Reply work?</li>
<li>How can teams blend research and engineering to make better products?</li>
<li>How did the DistBelief project shape Tensor Flow?</li>
<li>How does Tensor Flow differ from streaming frameworks that are more generalized like Spark or Storm?</li>
<li>Why would I want to do machine learning on my phone?</li>
<li>How is Tensor Flow fault tolerant?</li>
<li>What are things the open source community should dive into in Tensor Flow, to fix and improve it?</li>

<h3>“Changing anything changes everything.”</h3>
<p>Technical debt, referring to the compounding cost of changes to software architecture, can be especially challenging in machine learning systems.</p>
<p>D. Sculley is a software engineer at Google, focusing on machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval. He recently co-authored the paper <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf">Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt</a>.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do you define technical debt?</li>
<li>Why does technical debt tend to compound like financial debt?</li>
<li>Is machine learning the marriage of hard-coded software logic and constantly changing external data?</li>
<li>What types of anti-patterns should be avoided by machine learning engineers?</li>
<li>What is a decision threshold in a machine learning system?</li>
<li>What advice would you give to organizations that are building their prototypes and product systems in different languages?</li>
