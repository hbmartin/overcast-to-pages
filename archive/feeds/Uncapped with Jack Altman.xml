      <title>Uncapped #13 | Sam Altman from OpenAI</title>
      <description>This was a fun one! Sam is my brother and the CEO of a small company in SF called OpenAI. I’m glad he was able to take time out of his busy schedule to give me a hard time and share his thoughts on the future of AI.

We covered:


  AI discovering new science

  The risk of superintelligence

  What’s after reasoning

  Humans needing humans

  The latest with OpenAI

  Meta / Scale AI news

  Plenty of brotherly banter

      <title>Uncapped #12 | Marc Andreessen from a16z</title>
      <description>Marc Andreessen is a cofounder and general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that manages $45 billion in assets under management. He is an innovator and creator, one of the few to pioneer a software category used by more than a billion people and one of the few to establish multiple billion-dollar companies.

Marc co-created the highly influential Mosaic internet browser and co-founded Netscape, which later sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. He also co-founded Loudcloud, which as Opsware, sold to Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion. He later served on the board of Hewlett-Packard from 2008 to 2018.

Marc serves on the board of the following Andreessen Horowitz portfolio companies: Applied Intuition, Carta, Coinbase, Dialpad, Flow, Golden, Honor, OpenGov, Samsara, Simple Things, and TipTop Labs. He is also on the board of Meta.

We covered:


  Evolution of the venture playbook

  Small vs large funds

  Current AI landscape

  Politics and Silicon Valley

  Tech and the media


A few highlights:


  Optimizing for the maximum amount of power

  Conflicts being the reason a16z isn’t even larger

  The middle is dead; you’re either Gucci or Walmart

  Only 8 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are innovating

  We’ve lived in an era of intense preference falsification

  AI and machines making the ultimate decision

      <title>Uncapped #11 | Jordan Bramble from Antares</title>
      <description>Jordan Bramble is the CEO of Antares, a nuclear energy company that has raised over $50M to become America’s industrial base partner for special-purpose microreactors. 

Antares focuses on high-value use cases in power-constrained environments that wouldn’t be possible without nuclear power. They are developing resilient fission-based power systems for critical assets for the Department of Defense on earth and in space. Unlike grid-scale reactors, these use cases primarily favor kilowatt-scale systems. This focus on non-commodity energy applications with smaller scale reactors will enable Antares to develop its first deployments on faster timelines with less research and development and capitalization risk. Antares also partners with commercial companies in extractive industries, edge computing, and space power, in turn bringing the benefits of commercial scale back to the DOD.

We covered:


  History of nuclear

  Demand for nuclear

  Small modular reactors

  Government collaboration

  Building in hard tech

  Scaling nuclear reactors


A few highlights:


  First nuclear reactor built under UChicago’s football field 

  A nuclear powered airplane that could fly indefinitely

  Net zero not being possible without nuclear

  Powering the AI demand for data centers

  The Golden Dome and lasers in space

  Working back from the mission effect

  Interdisciplinary problems attracting talent

(30:11) Selling to defense

(34:30) LA becoming a hard tech hub

(37:13) Fostering a culture in hard tech

(43:42) How to scale nuclear reactors

  Scaling something deemed unscalable

  Art of being collaborative

  Taste not being teachable

  VC help being overrated

  Building a NYC brand

      <description>I had a blast sitting down with Qasar Younis, Co-Founder and CEO of Applied Intuition, a company that’s on a mission to accelerate the world’s adoption of safe and intelligent machines.

      <title>Uncapped #8 | Josh Kopelman from First Round Capital</title>
      <description>It was a pleasure to sit down this week with Josh Kopelman, one of the original architects of seed stage investing who continues to re-invent what it means to operate within venture. 

Josh co-founded First Round Capital, which has invested at the earliest stages in companies like Square, Uber, and Roblox. Some of Josh’s more recent investments include Notion, Pomelo Care, Loyal, and Perpay. Since First Round’s inception in 2004, Josh has invested in 500+ startups and has frequently made the Forbes “Midas List” which ranks the top 100 tech investors.

Josh has been a founder three times (four if you include founding First Round). In 1992, while in college, he co-founded Infonautics Corporation – and took it public on NASDAQ in 1996. Josh co-founded Half.com in 1999 and led it to become one of the largest sellers of used books, movies and music in the world. Half.com was acquired by eBay in 2000, where Josh remained for three years. In late 2003, Josh helped to found TurnTide, an anti-spam company that created the world’s first anti-spam router. TurnTide was acquired by Symantec just six months later.

We covered:


  His “Venture Arrogance Score”

  The role of relevance in venture

  Making money in disequilibrium

  Overlooking margin superiority 

  Decision-making as a product

      <title>Uncapped #4 | Adam Guild from Owner</title>
      <description>Adam Guild is the CEO of Owner, a business he started when he was only 17. It now has tens of millions of revenue, hundreds of employees, and thousands of customers.

I’ve had the pleasure of working on his board for a few years now, and he is one of the most impressive people I’ve ever gotten to know. Working with him was a big part of what made me realize I want to do venture for the rest of my career.

He tracks his nutrition, exercise, time, and sleep to an extreme degree so he can show up to work every day as strong as possible. He goes to extreme lengths to recruit the best talent. He is equal parts hungry to learn from everyone around him, but courageous in making his own unconventional decisions.

I think he’s one of the most under-known founders right now, but I think that will soon change. 

Hope you enjoy watching this.

While a General Partner at Founders Fund, he led investments in Ramp, Trade Republic, and Aven, and before that made early personal investments in YouTube, Airbnb, Palantir, Lyft, Udemy, and Eventbrite.
