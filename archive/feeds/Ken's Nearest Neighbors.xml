  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Ken's Nearest Neighbors Podcast is about telling the unique stories of the people in the data and AI space. In highly technical fields, we often lose sight of the individuals who are making the positive change. The podcast focuses on who these people are and how they have approached the big decisions in their life that shaped their world view and career. While the podcast is centered on a technical domain, the conversations often touch on personal philosophy, the pursuit of meaning, and how we define success in our career and lives.</p>]]></description>

Chat GPT and GPT 4 present scary and interesting questions for the future of the data domain and for the way our world works at large. I sat down and asked Chat GPT questions about its GPT-4 trained version of itself, the data domain, autogpt,issues with its use, and even the 6 month proposed pause on the training of GPT 5. This was a fascinating experience for me to learn more about this technology and hopefully help educate others about major issues revolving around its future. I should also note that I also used another AI tool, elevenlabs, to give Chat GPT a voice. I randomly selected the voice from a group of around 30, it is not my personification or interpretation of what I think the model would sound like.¬†<br/><br/>Podcast Sponsors, Affiliates, and Partners:<br/>- Pathrise - http://pathrise.com/KenJee | Career mentorship for job applicants (Free till you land a job)<br/>- Taro - http://jointaro.com/r/kenj308 (20% discount) | Career mentorship if you already have a job¬†<br/>- 365 Data Science (57% discount) - https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY | Learn data science today<br/>- Interview Query (10% discount) - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee |¬† Interview prep questions</p>]]></description>

He currently leads the data science function at Revantage, a real estate shared service organization in the Blackstone family, and enjoys regularly sharing his perspective on the field on LinkedIn. Richad got a BA in Neuroscience and Anthropology and was on the PhD path until he realized a life of basic research was not for him. He pivoted and earned a Masters in Commerce (concentration in Marketing and Management) from the University of Virginia where he met me. After a brief stint in inside sales, Richad committed to data science and built his career in the real estate and finance spaces. He started at CoreLogic focusing on text mining, then moved to Greystone leading all things data in an innovation lab, before joining Revantage. Richad credits his career progress to focusing on impact and deeply understanding the business case. In this interview we gain some insight into the specifics of data in the real estate domain and we learn about how Richad was able to go from analyst to director level in less than 4 years.¬†</p>]]></description>

In this episode we learn about how Edward‚Äôs career in machine learning was kicked off by a happy accident while studying abroad, how machine learning is being applied to malware detection, and how a data career contracting for the government may be different than one working for a private company. I hope you enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I had the pleasure of interviewing Ovetta Sampson. I co-teach a grad student course called Designing Ethical AI Sysetms with Ovetta. As a Principal Design Director at Microsoft, she works with a team of talented researchers, data scientists, designers and engineers that work with large-scale customers to visualize a clear path to digital transformation that starts in the now and builds towards the future. Ovetta is an IDEO alumna as well. While working there, her sweet spot was the intersection of humanity, business and technology. Combining her M.S. in Computer Science (HCI) with her BA in Communications, Ovetta is always thinking about how to visualize humanity‚Äôs future and how serve people through digital and intelligent products ethically and with compassion. In this interview we learn about how Journalism and influence from her father launched her interest in design and technology. We also learn about the world she sees where designers and data scientists join forces to make positive change in the world. We end with a fascinating conversation about ethics related to AI, and how we can use design to better understand our human bias. I hope you enjoy this episode!</p>]]></description>

While at BYU, he majored in Math and has a master&apos;s degree in Public Administration. He also played Tight End on the football team there from 2008-2011. After a few years coaching, he transitioned to Analytics in his current role with UVA. He started the Master&apos;s of Data Science degree at UVA this semester, and is excited to learn more about Data Science. He is married to MaryBeth Edwards, and has two boys: Luke and Shea who are already starting to get interested in college football, or at least the team mascots. In this interview we learn how Matt made his way into analytics from the player and coaching route. We talk at length about how someone can break into sports analytics as a career, and we also touch on why he decided to go back for his masters in data science at UVA. I hope you enjoy!</p>]]></description>

I talk about who I am, what you can expect from the podcast, and why you&apos;ll want to stay tuned for future episodes.<br/><br/>So what is this new podcast thing I‚Äôm doing? To put simply, this podcast is a more formalized version of¬† the interviews that I have been doing on my channel for some time now. I wanted to make them easier to listen to on the go and bring you all increasingly exciting and diverse guests.¬†<br/><br/>If you aren‚Äôt familiar, my name is Ken Jee and I am the head of data science at a sports analytics consulting firm. I am probably better known for my youtube channel though. A staple of my career has been learning through examples. I think there is tremendous power in stories, and this podcast was formulated to bring the most interesting stories I could find about data science, sports analytics, productivity and learning philosophy straight to your ears. Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to bring in some of my idols from data science, sports, and maybe even the authors from some of the books that I‚Äôve read.¬†<br/><br/>This first podcast episode is named ‚Äúwho am I?‚Äù because I have yet to come up with a name. I thought it would be awesome to have the various communities that I am a part of come up with a fitting title. The winner will get a shout out, 30 minutes of my time for data science advice (or just to chat), and a prize based on their region. Comment below with a name, on the twitter post, or on my community post which I have linked below. Hint: I like puns. I would love for you all to be involved in this endeavor with me!¬†<br/><br/>This podcast will be available on all of the main channels, spotify, apple podcats, etc. and will also have its dedicated youtube channel. I will also have a podcast clips channel for if you only want the juiciest of clips and hottest of takes.¬†<br/><br/>The first 10 or so episodes will be bulk uploaded at the beginning of November. These are duplicates of the interviews on my youtube channel. From there, it will be a fresh episode every week only available on the platforms I‚Äôve mentioned before. I highly encourage guest recommendations, topics, and feedback to make this the best platform possible.¬†<br/><br/>Again, thank you for tuning in, and I look forward to learning with you on this fun new journey!<br/><br/></p>]]></description>

I am probably better known for my youtube channel though. A staple of my career has been learning through examples. I think there is tremendous power in stories, and this podcast was formulated to bring the most interesting stories I could find about data science, sports analytics, productivity and learning philosophy straight to your ears. Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to bring in some of my idols from data science, sports, and maybe even the authors from some of the books that I‚Äôve read.¬†<br/><br/>This first podcast episode is named ‚Äúwho am I?‚Äù because I have yet to come up with a name. I thought it would be awesome to have the various communities that I am a part of come up with a fitting title. The winner will get a shout out, 30 minutes of my time for data science advice (or just to chat), and a prize based on their region. Comment below with a name, on the twitter post, or on my community post which I have linked below. Hint: I like puns. I would love for you all to be involved in this endeavor with me!¬†<br/><br/>This podcast will be available on all of the main channels, spotify, apple podcats, etc. and will also have its dedicated youtube channel. I will also have a podcast clips channel for if you only want the juiciest of clips and hottest of takes.¬†<br/><br/>The first 10 or so episodes will be bulk uploaded at the beginning of November. These are duplicates of the interviews on my youtube channel. From there, it will be a fresh episode every week only available on the platforms I‚Äôve mentioned before. I highly encourage guest recommendations, topics, and feedback to make this the best platform possible.¬†<br/><br/>Again, thank you for tuning in, and I look forward to learning with you on this fun new journey!<br/><br/></p>]]></content:encoded>
